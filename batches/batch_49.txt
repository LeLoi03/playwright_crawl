 5th IMA and OR Society Conference on Mathematics of Operational Research  
   
 Building on the success of the four previous conferences (held in 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023) this biennial event will aim to draw together the considerable community of researchers and practitioners who use and / or develop innovative mathematics and data driven approaches, relevant to the applications and theory of Operational Research (OR).  
 The conference will be held at the beautiful and easily accessible Conference Centre Aston in Birmingham and will showcase activities from across all areas of OR. We welcome contributions that are empirically motivated and with a focus on application, as well as those that are theoretically driven. The conference will host plenaries from leading international experts, sessions of themed talks, as well as poster sessions, and will provide plenty of opportunities for networking. We look forward to seeing you in Birmingham in April 2025 for a terrific event and to celebrate together the successes of OR!  
 EDI   
  The IMA, the OR Society, and the conference committee strongly support diversity and inclusion. It is our intention to host a conference that is welcoming and inclusive for all, and we will be making active efforts to support the participation of individuals and groups who are under-represented at such academic events and in our discipline more broadly.  
  As part of improving understanding amongst the OR community of the different barriers individuals face, we would like to invite session leaders and individual speakers to include as part of their presentation(s) their own experiences of achievement, inclusion, and exclusion. This will be complemented with a number of focused sessions with key speakers on the particular challenges faced by different groups.  
  A pack for delegates will include details on the venue’s accessibility, baby changing facilities and the nearby Martin Luther King multi-faith prayer centre. We will also include information to signpost details on local creches, transport links, and other local amenities. We also welcome special requests and suggestions, and will accommodate them where possible.  
 Call for session organisation  
 We welcome suggestions for the organisation of sessions in all areas of OR. If you are interested in organising a session, then please fill out this form  .  
 Deadline for submissions is the 6th December.

 Scope   

 Image analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the “discrete approach” to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.

 Scope  
 IWCIA’20 is the twentieth of a series of International Workshop on Combinatorial Image Analysis. It will take place in Novi Sad, Serbia, July 16-18, 2020  . Previous meetings were held in Paris (France, 1991), Ube (Japan, 1992), Washington DC (USA, 1994), Lyon (France, 1995), Hiroshima (Japan, 1997), Madras (India, 1999), Caen  (France, 2000), Philadelphia  (USA, 2001), Palermo (Italy, 2003), Auckland  (New Zealand, 2004), Berlin  (Germany, 2006), Buffalo  , NY (USA, 2008), Playa del Carmen  (Mexico, 2009), Madrid  (Spain, 2011), Austin  (Texas, 2012), Brno  (Czech Republic, 2014), Kolkata  (India, 2015), Plovdiv  (Bulgaria, 2017) and Porto  (Portugal, 2018) .  
 The official poster of IWCIA’20 can be found here  .  
 Image analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the “discrete approach” to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.  
 The scientific program of the workshop consists of keynote talks, contributed papers, and posters.  
 After the Workshop, the authors can submit extended versions of their works for publication in special journal issue: Journal of Combinatorial Optimization of Springer   has already been arranged.  
      
 The previous IWCIA proceedings are available on the SpringerLink website here.   
 Topics  
 The Workshop is a forum for current research on the following (or similar) research subjects which are directly or potentially applicable to image analysis:  
 Combinatorial problems in the discrete plane and space; Lattice polygons and polytopes 
  Digital/combinatorial geometry and topology 
  Digital manifolds; Geometry of digital curves and surfaces 
  Analysis and processing of digital surfaces with singularities (such as “pinched digital surfaces”) 
  Homotopy of digital manifolds; thinning algorithms and skeletons 
  Boundary tracking of digital solids; Geometric characteristics of object boundaries 
  Multigrid convergence analysis of metric-based descriptors 
  Tilings and patterns; Combinatorial pattern matching 
  Computational geometry and imaging sciences 
  Integer programming, linear programming, and graph theoretic models and approaches to problems of image analysis

  The program committee may decline to make these awards or may split them.  

 Submission instructions  
 Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting original unpublished research in the topics related to the symposium.

  Submissions must be in the form of a single pdf file prepared using the LNCS latex templates and style files. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available on Overleaf. Springer’s authors’ guidelines may be consulted here.  Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers, and requieres to draw the attention of the contributing conference paper authors to the Code of Conduct.   
  Each submission should consist of the main part of the paper, not exceeding 12 pages (including the title page and excluding the references), plus an optional clearly marked appendix (to be read at the discretion of the program committee). Any figure pertaining to the main part of the paper should be included therein (within the 12 page limit). The first page must include an indication of whether the paper is eligible for the best student paper award.  
  Submissions not conforming to the above rules as well as papers outside of the scope of the conference will be rejected with­out consideration.

 1.  Topographia hibernica  
 by Blindboy Boatclub  
 €9.49    
 'Memorable, unsettling and humane' GUARDIAN 'One of the best books I have ever read ... I can't recommend him or it enough' JOHNNY MARR 'One of the most gifted writers of his generation' IRISH TIMES Driving with a donkey stuffed in the back seat; jackdaws pecking brains out through the roof of a confessional box; cat piss and astronauts. This is not the world as you see it, but as it is, twisted from the maverick mind of Blindboy Boatclub. These are stories of the strange unsettlings in the souls of men caught in between the past and the possible; stories of heart-blinding rage and disquieting compassion. Blindboy Boatclub is the essential voice for the Irish condition in the twenty-first century, and in Topographia Hibernica he unravels the knotted threads of humanity, nature and colonisation from a contemporary perspective. * Topographia Hibernica was a bestseller in Ireland in November 2023 *

 5.  It ends with us (film tie in)  
 by Colleen Hoover  
 €9.49    
 THE MULTI-MILLION-COPY GLOBAL BESTSELLER. SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOVIE. Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn't hurt. Lily can't get him out of her head. But Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his "no dating" rule, she can't help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel, It Ends With Us is a heart-wrenching story and an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.

 6.  Fiance Dilemma  
 by Elena Armas  
 €9.49    
 Josie Moore has given the opposite sex––and love––plenty of chances. Four exactly, if you count all her failed engagements, and five if you include the absentee father who kept her existence a secret until very recently. So when her father decides to announce his retirement with a splashy magazine piece about the family, Josie realizes her romantic history is a complicated PR issue. Matthew Flanagan is the mud, literally. Not only has he been fired from his job, but also the tires of his car are stuck in the muck after taking a wrong turn as he enters Green Oak, North Carolina. So, he grabs a duffel with his essentials and goes in b search of a place to crash until he gets his life back on track. But instead, he finds his best friend’s sister, Josie, greeting him as her fiancé. What starts as a big messy misunderstanding quickly turns into an arrangement with Matthew playing a new role as doting fiancé. A fifth engagement––and a stunt, at that––makes Josie’s stomach turn, but every dilemma requires a choice between equally undesirable alternatives, and Matthew doesn’t seem to mind becoming one more number in a colourful list of grooms-that-never-were. Despite the ring on her finger, Josie knows this is only temporary, even if the rest of the small town believes that the fifth time’s the charm.

Steve Berry, New York Times bestselling author of The 9th Man and the Cotton Malone series Israel, late 1973. As the Yom Kippur War flares into life, a state-of-the-art Soviet MIG fighter is racing at breakneck speed over the arid scrublands below . . . and promptly disappears. NASA Flight Controller and former US Navy test pilot Kaz Zemeckis watches the scene from the ground - and is quickly pulled into a dizzying, high-stakes game of spies, lies and a possible high-level defection that plays out across three continents. The prize is beyond value: the secrets of the Soviets' mythical 'Foxbat' MiG-25, the fastest, highest-flying fighter plane in the world and the key to Cold War air supremacy. But every defection is double-edged with risk, and Kaz must tread a careful line between trust and suspicion. Ultimately, he must invite the fox into the henhouse - bringing the defector into the heart of the United States' most secret test site - and hope that, with skill and cunning, the game plays out his way. For Chris Hadfield's second heart-stopping thriller, we move from Space to another rich and exciting part of Chris's CV: his time as a top test pilot in both the US Air Force and the US Navy, and as an RCAF fighter pilot intercepting armed Soviet bombers in North American airspace. Full of insider detail, excitement and political intrigue drawn from real events, The Defector brings us the nerve-shredding rush of aerial combat, as told by one of the world's best fighter pilots.

Working here is my last chance to start fresh. I can pretend to be whoever I want. But soon, I realize that the Winchesters’ secrets are far more dangerous than my own... Every day, I clean the Winchesters' stunning house from top to bottom, pick up their daughter from school, and prepare a delicious meal for the family before retreating to my small room on the top floor. But as I settle into this role, I notice strange things—Nina making messes just to watch me clean, telling lies about her daughter, and her husband Andrew seeming more troubled by the day.

She thought she might be sick. Splayed on the lawn below was Frank, apparently out cold. Her husband snored in the bed behind her. She loved Shay, of course she did, but right now the only person she wanted to think about was Conor. She didn't want to think about Bea or Lizzie or what Lizzie might have got up to with Shay. Frank's 48th birthday had given the three couples an excuse for a much needed night away from children, nagging bills and ailing parents. The drink flowed, life in Dublin with all its stress felt a long way away. When Frank proposed they swap partners, it felt deliciously, irresistibly reckless. One night. No obligations. No expectations. All the women had to do was text a man of their choice. The only rule? No falling in love. It was a night that some of them couldn't remember. And others couldn't forget.

MUNICH, 1935 - The Bavarian capital is a magnet for young, aristocratic Britons who come to learn German, swim in the lakes and drink beer in the cellars. What they don't see - or choose to ignore - is the brutal underbelly of the Nazi movement which considers Munich its spiritual home.

Wolff is already walking a tight line between doing his job and falling foul of the political party he abhors. Now Hitler is taking a personal interest in the case. Followed by the secret police and threatened by his own son, a fervent member of the Hitler Youth, the stakes have never been higher. And when Wolff begins to suspect that the killer might be linked to the highest reaches of the Nazi hierarchy, he fears his task is simply impossible - and that he might become the next victim.

In the summer of 1974 a heatwave blankets Boston and Mary Pat Fennessey is trying to stay one step ahead of the bill collectors. Mary Pat has lived her entire life in the housing projects of 'Southie', the Irish American enclave that stubbornly adheres to old tradition and stands proudly apart. One night Mary Pat's teenage daughter Jules stays out late and doesn't come home. That same evening, a young Black man is found dead, struck by a subway train under mysterious circumstances. The two events seem unconnected. But Mary Pat, propelled by a desperate search for her missing daughter, begins turning over stones best left untouched - asking questions that bother Marty Butler, chieftain of the Irish mob, and the men who work for him, men who don't take kindly to any threat to their business. Set against the hot, tumultuous months when the city's desegregation of its public schools exploded in violence, Small Mercies is a superb thriller, a brutal depiction of criminality and power, and an unflinching portrait of the dark heart of American racism.

It shouldn't matter. He's not her type - the man translates classics into Latin for fun, and his membership at the exclusive club where she bartends means he's strictly off limits. But she can't deny that, beneath his cool exterior, is a man who could make her melt with just a touch. No matter how hard they try, they can't resist giving into their forbidden desires. Even if it costs them everything. King of Pride is a steamy opposites attract billionaire romance. It includes explicit content and profanity.

Dante Russo thrives on control, both personally and professionally. The billionaire CEO never planned to marry - until the threat of blackmail forces him into an engagement with a woman he barely knows: Vivian Lau, jewellery heiress and daughter of his newest enemy. It doesn't matter how beautiful or charming she is. He'll do everything in his power to destroy the evidence and their betrothal. There's only one problem: now that he has her . . . he can't bring himself to let her go. *** Elegant. Ambitious. Well-mannered.

However, none infuriate - or tempt - her more than a certain billionaire heir, with his stupid dimples and laid-back attitude.

 by Ali Hazelwood  
 €9.49    
 A dangerous alliance between a Vampyre bride and an Alpha werewolf becomes a love deep enough to sink your teeth into in this new paranormal romance from the New York Times bestselling author of The Love Hypothesis. Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyre councilman of the Southwest, is an outcast - again. Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold an historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange - again . . . Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It's clear from the way he tracks Misery's every movement that he doesn't trust her. If only he knew how right he was . . . Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what's hers, even if it means a life alone in Were territory . . . alone with the wolf.

 #1 New York Times bestselling author Tessa Bailey is back in Napa Valley with this hilarious rom-com about a down-on-her-luck heiress who suggests a mutually beneficial marriage of convenience to a man she can't stand... only to discover there's a fine line between love and hate. After losing her job and her fiancé in one fell swoop, Natalie Vos returned home to lick her wounds. A few months later, she's sufficiently drowned her sorrows in cabernet and she's ready to get back on her feet. She just needs her trust fund to finance her new business venture. Unfortunately, the terms require she marry before she can have the money. And well, dumped, remember? But Natalie is desperate enough to propose to a man who makes her want to kill him-and kiss him, in equal measure. August Cates may own a vineyard, but he doesn't know jack about making wine. He's determined to do his late best friend proud, no matter what it takes. Except his tasting room is empty, his wine is disgusting (seriously, he once saw someone gag), and his buddy's legacy is circling the drain. No bank will give him the loan he needs to turn the business around... and then the gorgeous, feisty heiress knocks on his door. Natalie has haunted August's dreams since the moment they met, but their sizzling chemistry immediately morphed into simmering insults. Now, a quickie marriage could help them both. A sham wedding, a few weeks living under the same roof, and then they can go their separate ways-assuming they make it out alive. How hard could it be? There's just one thing they didn't account for: their unfortunate, unbearable, undeniable attraction.

Suddenly she is jolted back to the secret past she hoped she'd put behind her forever. And this man does not want to stay forgotten. As Christmas nudges closer, she feels him closing in and decides to come up with a plan to keep him away from her family. But just how far will one woman go to protect a good life? And how far will one man go to destroy it?

 We invite the submission of manuscripts presenting original research results to the IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Quality of Service (IWQoS) 2025  , which will be held from July 2-4, 2025  , in Gold Coast, Australia  . Quality of Service (QoS) has long been a central focus for communications and networking researchers worldwide. While traditional QoS research areas continue to garner significant interest, emerging domains such as the Internet of Things, data centers, virtualization, cloud and fog computing, green computing, and artificial intelligence are driving a new wave of research into service guarantees related to QoS, Quality of Experience (QoE), Quality of Protection (QoP), Software Quality, Data Quality, and, more broadly, Quality of Information Technology.  
 For over two decades, IWQoS has established itself as a premier forum for presenting novel ideas on all QoS-related subjects. The 33rd International Symposium on Quality of Service (IEEE/ACM IWQoS 2025)  aims to continue this tradition as an international platform for the presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research in the field. The scope of IWQoS encompasses both the latest theoretical advancements and experimental research papers.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts not exceeding 10 single-spaced, double-column pages (including references) using a font size of 10 points, formatted according to the standard IEEE template for LaTeX or Microsoft Word. Templates can be downloaded by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE Template Selector at https://template-selector.ieee.org/  .  
 The review process will be double-blind, requiring submissions to avoid revealing the authors' names and affiliations, as well as to refrain from obvious self-references. Papers that do not adhere to these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of their merits. All submissions must be made electronically as PDF files.

 5th IMA and OR Society Conference on Mathematics of Operational Research  
   
 Building on the success of the four previous conferences (held in 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023) this biennial event will aim to draw together the considerable community of researchers and practitioners who use and / or develop innovative mathematics and data driven approaches, relevant to the applications and theory of Operational Research (OR).  
 The conference will be held at the beautiful and easily accessible Conference Centre Aston in Birmingham and will showcase activities from across all areas of OR. We welcome contributions that are empirically motivated and with a focus on application, as well as those that are theoretically driven. The conference will host plenaries from leading international experts, sessions of themed talks, as well as poster sessions, and will provide plenty of opportunities for networking. We look forward to seeing you in Birmingham in April 2025 for a terrific event and to celebrate together the successes of OR!  
 EDI   
  The IMA, the OR Society, and the conference committee strongly support diversity and inclusion. It is our intention to host a conference that is welcoming and inclusive for all, and we will be making active efforts to support the participation of individuals and groups who are under-represented at such academic events and in our discipline more broadly.  
  As part of improving understanding amongst the OR community of the different barriers individuals face, we would like to invite session leaders and individual speakers to include as part of their presentation(s) their own experiences of achievement, inclusion, and exclusion. This will be complemented with a number of focused sessions with key speakers on the particular challenges faced by different groups.  
  A pack for delegates will include details on the venue’s accessibility, baby changing facilities and the nearby Martin Luther King multi-faith prayer centre. We will also include information to signpost details on local creches, transport links, and other local amenities. We also welcome special requests and suggestions, and will accommodate them where possible.  
 Call for session organisation  
 We welcome suggestions for the organisation of sessions in all areas of OR. If you are interested in organising a session, then please fill out this form  .

25. Conference JELIA_0:
JELIA - European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence  
 About JELIA  
 Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies, and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever.  
 The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (or Journées Européennes sur la Logique en Intelligence Artificielle - JELIA) began back in 1988, as a workshop, in response to the need for a European forum for the discussion of emerging work in this field. Since then, JELIA has been organised biennially, with English as official language, and with proceedings published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series. Previous meetings took place in Roscoff, France (1988), Amsterdam, Netherlands (1990), Berlin, Germany (1992), York, UK (1994), Évora, Portugal (1996), Dagstuhl, Germany (1998), Málaga, Spain (2000), Cosenza, Italy (2002), Lisbon, Portugal (2004), Liverpool, UK (2006), Dresden, Germany (2008), Helsinki, Finland (2010), Toulouse, France (2012), Funchal, Madeira, Portugal (2014), Larnaca, Cyprus (2016), Rende, Italy (2019) and Klagenfurt, Austria (2021).  
 The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.  
  
  JELIA 2023 - 18th Edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence   
 The conference is to be held on September 20 - 22, 2023 organized by the TU Dresden  , Germany. For further information please visit the website of the conference  .

 INTRODUCTION  

 In Bologna you will find the most ancient University of the world  , founded in 1088, and nowadays ranked amongst the most important and influencing European academic institutions.  
 In this charming medieval city you will also find a thriving scientific environment  , where research on AI is conducted side by side to public bodies (CINECA Consortium hosts the largest Italian computing center for Big Data; the EU chose the data center of the European Center for Weather Forecast), and to the private initiative (the region has the largest number of startup companies per inhabitant in Italy).  
 Many researchers are already exploiting AI to solve a plethora of sustainability-related issues.  
 We strongly believe that AI will be the key to also understand the sustainability theme in a holistic manner, helping us to reach some awareness over the complexities of our planet, our ecosystems, and our societies.  
 The conference will be supported by the European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI)  and the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence (AIxIA)  .

  About the conference 
  Conference history 

 About the conference  iwsm-mensura    2020-04-03T06:15:43+00:00  The IWSM Mensura conference is the result of the joining of forces of the International Workshop on Software Measurement   and the International Conference on Software Process and Product Measurement  (Mensura)  . Together they form the conference where new ideas from the world of academic research meet practical improvements from industry on topics of measuring software. Each year practitioners and researchers from all over the world gather together to learn about new developments, test new ideas and exchange possible new solutions and applications.  
 The 2020 conference in Mexico is the 30 th  edition of the conference. Read the historical overview in the March 2020 issue  of Software Measurement News  .  
 Why do we have this conference  
 The pressure for more efficient software development and maintenance processes delivering appropriate quality is constantly increasing. Software measurement is a key technology with which to manage and to control software development projects and software maintenance activities. Measurement is essential to any engineering activity, by increasing the scientific and technical knowledge for both the practice of software development and maintenance and for empirical research in software technology. For this reason the IWSM Mensura conference facilitates the exchange of software measurement experiences between academic theory and industry practice.  
 The International Workshop on Software Measurement (IWSM) has a big tradition that started in 1990  with a small working group in Germany with professor Reiner Dumke of the Otto von Güricke Universität in Magdeburg, Christof Ebert of Alcatel and professor Horst Zuse of the Technical University of Berlin. During the nineties the team of professor Alain Abran from the University of Québec joined in. Until 2006  the IWSM rotated between the Montréal area in Canada and various German cities.  
 The International Conference on Software Process and Product Measurement (also known as Mensura, the roman word for to measure  ) was founded in 2006 by professor Juan J Cuadrado Gallego from the University of Alcalá (Spain). The first edition was held in Cádiz.  
 To foster research, practice and exchange of experiences and best practices in 2007  both conferences joined forces and held a joint conference on the Island of Mallorca. Since then both conferences act as a combined conference and the conference is now traveling around the world.

 18th Edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence  
 September 20-22 2023,  
  hosted by TU Dresden, Germany  

 About JELIA 2023  

 Welcome to JELIA 2023, the 18th edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence, to be held in Dresden by the International Center for Computational Logic of TU Dresden   .  
 Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever.  
 The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence   (or Journées Européennes sur la Logique en Intelligence Artificielle - JELIA) began back in 1988, as a workshop, in response to the need for a European forum for the discussion of emerging work in this field. Since then, JELIA has been organised biennially, with proceedings published in the Springer-Verlag series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence   . Previous meetings took place in Roscoff France (1988), Amsterdam Netherlands (1990), Berlin, Germany (1992), York, UK (1994), Évora Portugal (1996), Dagstuhl, Germany (1998), Málaga, Spain (2000), Cosenza, Italy (2002), Lisbon, Portugal (2004), Liverpool, UK (2006), Dresden, Germany (2008), Helsinki, Finland (2010), Toulouse, France (2012), Madeira, Portugal (2014), Larnaca, Cyprus (2016), Rende Italy (2019), Klagenfurt, Austria (2021).  
 The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.

  About 

 European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (JELIA)   
 The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (JELIA for Journées Européennes sur la Logique en Intelligence Artificielle) began back in 1988 as a workshop in response to the need for a European forum to discuss emerging work in this field.  
  Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies, and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever.  
  The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and its overall technical quality have turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.  
 EurAI sponsored the 16th edition of JELIA  ( 2019, Rende - Italy  )

39. Conference K-CAP_1:
K-CAP 2023  
 The Twelfth International Conference on Knowledge Capture  
 December 5 - 7, 2023  
 Pensacola, Florida, USA  

 Knowledge has played a fundamental role since the inception of artificial intelligence. While the forms in which algorithms have leveraged knowledge have evolved over time, the need for efficient representations is ever more critical. Indeed, recent advances of AI, such as the stunning performance of large language models have relied on the large amount of data available on the Web. There is growing agreement among researchers that it's important to look beyond the sheer volume of data, and instead also prioritize the development of methods that are accurate, precise, and efficient for capturing knowledge.  
 The International Conference on Knowledge Capture, K-CAP, aims at bringing together an interdisciplinary group of researchers on a diverse set of topics with interest in the development of knowledge capture. This involves the design and development of formalisms, methods and tools that enable efficient and precise extraction and organization of knowledge from different sources and for different modalities of use including, for example, automated reasoning, machine learning and human-machine teaming.  
  
 To enable a vibrant and constructive discussion on scalable and precise knowledge capture, K-CAP 2023, calls for the participation of researchers from diverse areas of artificial intelligence, including, but not limited to, knowledge representation and reasoning, knowledge acquisition, semantic web, intelligent user interfaces for knowledge acquisition and retrieval, query processing and question answering over heterogeneous knowledge bases, novel evaluation paradigms, problem-solving and reasoning, ethics and AI, explainability, neurosymbolic AI, agents, information extraction from structured or unstructured data, machine learning and representation learning, information enrichment and visualization, as well as researchers interested in cyber-infrastructures to foster the publication, retrieval, reuse, and integration of data.  
 K-CAP is an in-person conference, and remote participation will not be supported.

 In today’s technology-driven society, effective access to and use of information is a key enabler for progress. Driven by the demands for knowledge-based applications and the unprecedented availability of information on the Web, the study of knowledge capture is of crucial importance. Knowledge capture involves the extraction of useful knowledge from vast and diverse online sources as well as its acquisition directly from human experts.  
     
 Researchers and practitioners who work in the area of knowledge capture traditionally participate in several distinct communities, including knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, humancomputer interaction, artificial intelligence, and the Semantic Web. K-CAP 2013 will provide a forum that brings together members of disparate research communities who are interested in efficiently capturing knowledge from a variety of sources and in creating representations that can be useful for automated reasoning, analysis, and other forms of machine processing, as well as to support users in knowledge-intensive collaborative tasks.  
     
 In addition, the wealth of information available and generated on the Web, both in structured, linked data forms and in unstructured information sources, brings the need for new methods to make knowledge emerge from such sources, following the recent democratisation, and somehow industrialisation, of areas such as open data, linked data and the Semantic Web. Such new methods must draw both from the traditional knowledge acquisition techniques and from more computational approaches, from large-scale data-mining, statistical analysis, data analytics, etc. For this reason, we are making the special theme of the K-CAP 2013 conference:  

 Knowledge Capture in the Age of Massive Web Data   
  
    This will be reflected both through encouraging paper submissions showing works on the way to deal with the scale, but also the distribution, heterogeneity, incompleteness, inconsistency and variety of both sources and results when trying to make knowledge emerge from massive Web data, including data published on the Web, as well as generated through the Web.  
     
 We will also, for the first time in the K-CAP conference series, introduce a special Application Track  , where submissions are invited to present results tested and deployed in real-life settings. The application track will pay special attention to in-use applications for the generation, management, and reuse of large amounts of existing data and knowledge resources on the Web. Data and knowledge-intensive applications in a variety of domains are welcome, including the Web of Data, mobile and sensor networks, large-scale scientific data management and reuse, open government and e-participation, social networks, and enterprise data management and business intelligence. We encourage submissions in such domains, dealing with topics including: big data capture, representation and analytics, crowd-sourcing for data generation and problem-solving, hybrid approaches combining knowledge engineering and machine learning, data and service dynamicity, heterogeneity and decay, and innovative user interfaces. Especially interesting are applications with available datasets and in-place data-driven business models.

 Research Track: Call for Papers (August Cycle)  
 KDD is the premier Data Science conference, hosting both a Research and an Applied Data Science Track. A paper should either be submitted to the Research Track or the Applied Data Science Track but not    both.  
 KDD has multiple submission cycles per year  . KDD 2025 will have two deadlines, one on August 1, 2024 and another on February 1, 2025 (with full paper deadlines a week after the abstract submission deadlines). Likewise, the KDD Proceedings will have two installments. Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 The conference will take place in Toronto, Canada, expected in August 2025.  
 Important Dates   
 Abstract Deadline: Aug 1, 2024 
  Paper Deadline: Aug 8, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: Oct 4-18, 2024 
  Notification: Nov 16, 2024 
  Camera-ready: | Dec 19, 2024 | TBD 
  Conference: Aug 3-7, 2025 
  All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  time zone.  
 Submission Site   
 We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.  
 All listed authors must  have an up-to-date  OpenReview profile. Here is information on how to create  an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:  
 New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that | can take up to two weeks | . 
  New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. 
  The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Incomplete OpenReview profile is sufficient ground for desk rejection. To be considered complete  , each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory  fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP, ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications. In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be indicated wherever applicable.  
 Abstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview  .  
   
  Scope   
   
  For the research track, we invite submission of papers describing innovative research on all aspects of knowledge discovery and data science, ranging from theoretical foundations to novel models and algorithms for data science problems in science, business, medicine, and engineering. Visionary papers on new and emerging topics are also welcome, as are application-oriented papers that make innovative technical contributions to research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Data Science: | Methods for analyzing social networks, time series, sequences, streams, text, web, graphs, rules, patterns, logs, IoT data, spatio-temporal data, biological data, scientific and business data; recommender systems, computational advertising, multimedia, finance, bioinformatics. 
  Big Data: | Large-scale systems for data analysis, machine learning, optimization, sampling, summarization; parallel and distributed data science (cloud, map-reduce, federated learning); novel algorithmic and statistical techniques for big data; algorithmically-efficient data transformation and integration. 
  Foundations: | Models and algorithms, asymptotic analysis; model selection, dimensionality reduction, relational/structured learning, matrix and tensor methods, probabilistic and statistical methods; deep learning, transfer learning, representation learning, meta learning, reinforcement learning; classification, clustering, regression, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, few shot learning and unsupervised learning; personalization, security and privacy, visualization; fairness, interpretability, ethics and robustness. 
  Submission Guidelines  
 Deadlines  . The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder or dummy abstracts are forbidden.  
 Authorship  . The ACM has an authorship policy  stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools  . Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper. Any use of generative AI tools must be disclosed and elaborated in the submission form.  
 Maximum authorship. In the research track, the number of submissions allowed per author is limited to | 7 | (seven) | maximum. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 7 by submission id, will be desk-rejected. 
  Authorship changes. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized | by submission deadline | . There | cannot | be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation. 
  Anonymity  . The review process will be double-blind  . The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to refer to your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools.  
 Formatting Requirements  . Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format  (also available  in Overleaf); Word users may use the Word Interim Template. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:  
 \documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}   Submissions must be a single  PDF file: 8  (eight)  content pages as main paper, followed by references and an optional Appendix that has no page limits. The Appendix can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc. The first 8 pages should be self-contained  , since reviewers are not required to read past that. Note that different limits will apply to camera-ready (see below).  
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  . Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification  that applies to all publications.  
 Resubmission Guidelines  . A paper that receives a Resubmit  decision during the Feb 2024 submission cycle may submit a revised version to the Aug 2024 deadline. A paper that was rejected during the Feb 2024 deadline could not  submit a revision, and could not  be re-submitted as a fresh submission to the Aug 2024 deadline. Please also refer to the FAQ for Resubmission  .  
 Resubmission must be indicated upon submission, along with the OpenReview forum id  of the previous submission. The resubmission should also include a summary of changes (limited to 5000 characters) in the submission form. The reviewers/AC/SAC will have visibility of the previous submission and reviews. We anticipate that Resubmit  papers that address the previously noted concerns appropriately would have a higher acceptance rate than fresh submissions, owing to the former’s selectivity and potential improvements.  
 Correspondingly, some of the fresh submissions to the Aug 2024 deadline may receive a Resubmit  decision for Feb 2025 deadline.  
 Serving as Reviewer  . To ensure that all papers receive a sufficient number of high quality reviewers, every submission must nominate at least one author who is a qualified reviewer (i.e., authors with at least three papers in KDD or other related conferences). Being named as a reviewer in the submission constitutes an acceptance and a commitment to carry out the regular reviewing load responsibly. Only if no qualified reviewer exists in the author list, nominate the best-qualified author for consideration by the PC chairs. Failure to provide a qualified reviewer when one exists in the author list, or failure to carry out the assigned reviewing duty properly, is sufficient ground for desk rejection.  
 Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent  . Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies.  
 Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. Note that submitting your research for approval by such may not always be sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by your IRB, the program committee might raise additional concerns about the ethical implications of the work and include these concerns in its review.  
 Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.   
 Reviewing Process  
 Reviewing  . Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews, overseen by an Area Chair (AC). At least one author per submission must commit to be a reviewer, carry the regular load, and submit all their reviews on time. If any author of a submission does not carry out the reviewing task in a proper  and timely  manner, no author of that submission will see the reviews of that submission during the rebuttal stage.  
 Any use of generative AI tools during the reviewing process must be disclosed in the review form. In particular, verbatim uploading of any passage from the paper being reviewed to any generative AI tool is forbidden.  
 Rebuttal  . Authors will have the chance to provide a response to each review during the rebuttal period. The ACs will consider the authors’ response to the points raised by the reviewers, as well as discussion among reviewers, to inform acceptance decisions.  
 Withdrawal  . Authors may request to withdraw their submissions only  during the rebuttal period. Such requests must be made in written form to the PC Chairs and are completed only upon their acknowledgment.  
 Decision  . A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.  
 Transparency  . By submitting paper(s) to KDD 2025, the authors agree that the original submission, reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.  
 Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy  
 All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. A domain conflict  (entered in Education & Career History) must be declared for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. A personal conflict  should be declared when the following associations exist:  
 candidate for employment at the same institution or company 
  co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months 
  active collaborator 
  family relationship or close personal relationship 
  graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation 
  deep personal animosity 
  In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere to ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy  as well as the ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  .  
 Any transgression that falls short of ethical standards will be investigated and may face disciplinary actions. Such transgressions include, but are not limited to, falsification, dual submission, collusion, pressuring any member of the program committee. Convicted misconduct may result in a 3-year ban from SIGKDD events for all  the authors.  
 Publication and Presentation Policies  
 Publication  . All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings ( 12  pages, of which 9  are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. That is, while we allow one more content page for accepted papers, we limit the references and Appendix to only 3 pages. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. The rights retained by authors who transfer copyright to ACM can be found here  . Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication  on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 Reproducibility  . Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. We are encouraging the (optional) use of the “Artifacts Available” badge in ACM’s Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.  
 Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two multi-authored papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the specified deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.  
 Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.  
 Official Publication Date.  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date for KDD 2025 will be confirmed at a later stage. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  . Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification  that applies to all publications.  
 Resubmission Guidelines  . A paper that receives a Resubmit  decision during the Feb 2024 submission cycle may submit a revised version to the Aug 2024 deadline. A paper that was rejected during the Feb 2024 deadline could not  submit a revision, and could not  be re-submitted as a fresh submission to the Aug 2024 deadline. Please also refer to the FAQ for Resubmission  .  
 Resubmission must be indicated upon submission, along with the OpenReview forum id  of the previous submission. The resubmission should also include a summary of changes (limited to 5000 characters) in the submission form. The reviewers/AC/SAC will have visibility of the previous submission and reviews. We anticipate that Resubmit  papers that address the previously noted concerns appropriately would have a higher acceptance rate than fresh submissions, owing to the former’s selectivity and potential improvements.  
 Correspondingly, some of the fresh submissions to the Aug 2024 deadline may receive a Resubmit  decision for Feb 2025 deadline.  
 Serving as Reviewer  . To ensure that all papers receive a sufficient number of high quality reviewers, every submission must nominate at least one author who is a qualified reviewer (i.e., authors with at least three papers in KDD or other related conferences). Being named as a reviewer in the submission constitutes an acceptance and a commitment to carry out the regular reviewing load responsibly. Only if no qualified reviewer exists in the author list, nominate the best-qualified author for consideration by the PC chairs. Failure to provide a qualified reviewer when one exists in the author list, or failure to carry out the assigned reviewing duty properly, is sufficient ground for desk rejection.  
 Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent  . Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies.  
 Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. Note that submitting your research for approval by such may not always be sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by your IRB, the program committee might raise additional concerns about the ethical implications of the work and include these concerns in its review.  
 Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.   
 Reviewing Process  
 Reviewing  . Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews, overseen by an Area Chair (AC). At least one author per submission must commit to be a reviewer, carry the regular load, and submit all their reviews on time. If any author of a submission does not carry out the reviewing task in a proper  and timely  manner, no author of that submission will see the reviews of that submission during the rebuttal stage.  
 Any use of generative AI tools during the reviewing process must be disclosed in the review form. In particular, verbatim uploading of any passage from the paper being reviewed to any generative AI tool is forbidden.  
 Rebuttal  . Authors will have the chance to provide a response to each review during the rebuttal period. The ACs will consider the authors’ response to the points raised by the reviewers, as well as discussion among reviewers, to inform acceptance decisions.  
 Withdrawal  . Authors may request to withdraw their submissions only  during the rebuttal period. Such requests must be made in written form to the PC Chairs and are completed only upon their acknowledgment.  
 Decision  . A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.  
 Transparency  . By submitting paper(s) to KDD 2025, the authors agree that the original submission, reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.  
 Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy  
 All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. A domain conflict  (entered in Education & Career History) must be declared for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. A personal conflict  should be declared when the following associations exist:  
 candidate for employment at the same institution or company 
  co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months 
  active collaborator 
  family relationship or close personal relationship 
  graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation 
  deep personal animosity 
  In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere to ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy  as well as the ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  .  
 Any transgression that falls short of ethical standards will be investigated and may face disciplinary actions. Such transgressions include, but are not limited to, falsification, dual submission, collusion, pressuring any member of the program committee. Convicted misconduct may result in a 3-year ban from SIGKDD events for all  the authors.  
 Publication and Presentation Policies  
 Publication  . All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings ( 12  pages, of which 9  are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. That is, while we allow one more content page for accepted papers, we limit the references and Appendix to only 3 pages. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. The rights retained by authors who transfer copyright to ACM can be found here  . Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication  on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 Reproducibility  . Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. We are encouraging the (optional) use of the “Artifacts Available” badge in ACM’s Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.  
 Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two multi-authored papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the specified deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.  
 Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.  
 Official Publication Date.  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date for KDD 2025 will be confirmed at a later stage. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Research Track: Call for Papers (August Cycle)  
 KDD is the premier Data Science conference, hosting both a Research and an Applied Data Science Track. A paper should either be submitted to the Research Track or the Applied Data Science Track but not    both.  
 KDD has multiple submission cycles per year  . KDD 2025 will have two deadlines, one on August 1, 2024 and another on February 1, 2025 (with full paper deadlines a week after the abstract submission deadlines). Likewise, the KDD Proceedings will have two installments. Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 The conference will take place in Toronto, Canada, expected in August 2025.  
 Important Dates   
 Abstract Deadline: Aug 1, 2024 
  Paper Deadline: Aug 8, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: Oct 4-18, 2024 
  Notification: Nov 16, 2024 
  Camera-ready: | Dec 19, 2024 | TBD 
  Conference: Aug 3-7, 2025 
  All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  time zone.  
 Submission Site   
 We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.  
 All listed authors must  have an up-to-date  OpenReview profile. Here is information on how to create  an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:  
 New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that | can take up to two weeks | . 
  New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. 
  The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Incomplete OpenReview profile is sufficient ground for desk rejection. To be considered complete  , each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory  fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP, ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications. In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be indicated wherever applicable.  
 Abstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview  .  
   
  Scope   
   
  For the research track, we invite submission of papers describing innovative research on all aspects of knowledge discovery and data science, ranging from theoretical foundations to novel models and algorithms for data science problems in science, business, medicine, and engineering.

  Foundations: | Models and algorithms, asymptotic analysis; model selection, dimensionality reduction, relational/structured learning, matrix and tensor methods, probabilistic and statistical methods; deep learning, transfer learning, representation learning, meta learning, reinforcement learning; classification, clustering, regression, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, few shot learning and unsupervised learning; personalization, security and privacy, visualization; fairness, interpretability, ethics and robustness. 
  Submission Guidelines  
 Deadlines  . The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder or dummy abstracts are forbidden.  
 Authorship  . The ACM has an authorship policy  stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools  . Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper. Any use of generative AI tools must be disclosed and elaborated in the submission form.  
 Maximum authorship. In the research track, the number of submissions allowed per author is limited to | 7 | (seven) | maximum. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 7 by submission id, will be desk-rejected. 
  Authorship changes. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized | by submission deadline | . There | cannot | be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation. 
  Anonymity  . The review process will be double-blind  . The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to refer to your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools.  
 Formatting Requirements  . Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format  (also available  in Overleaf); Word users may use the Word Interim Template. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:  
 \documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}   Submissions must be a single  PDF file: 8  (eight)  content pages as main paper, followed by references and an optional Appendix that has no page limits. The Appendix can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc. The first 8 pages should be self-contained  , since reviewers are not required to read past that. Note that different limits will apply to camera-ready (see below).  
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  . Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed.

 Research Track: Call for Papers (August Cycle)  
 KDD is the premier Data Science conference, hosting both a Research and an Applied Data Science Track. A paper should either be submitted to the Research Track or the Applied Data Science Track but not    both.  
 KDD has multiple submission cycles per year  . KDD 2025 will have two deadlines, one on August 1, 2024 and another on February 1, 2025 (with full paper deadlines a week after the abstract submission deadlines). Likewise, the KDD Proceedings will have two installments. Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 The conference will take place in Toronto, Canada, expected in August 2025.  
 Important Dates   
 Abstract Deadline: Aug 1, 2024 
  Paper Deadline: Aug 8, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: Oct 4-18, 2024 
  Notification: Nov 16, 2024 
  Camera-ready: | Dec 19, 2024 | TBD 
  Conference: Aug 3-7, 2025 
  All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  time zone.  
 Submission Site   
 We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.  
 All listed authors must  have an up-to-date  OpenReview profile. Here is information on how to create  an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:  
 New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that | can take up to two weeks | . 
  New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. 
  The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Incomplete OpenReview profile is sufficient ground for desk rejection. To be considered complete  , each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory  fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP, ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications. In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be indicated wherever applicable.  
 Abstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview  .  
   
  Scope   
   
  For the research track, we invite submission of papers describing innovative research on all aspects of knowledge discovery and data science, ranging from theoretical foundations to novel models and algorithms for data science problems in science, business, medicine, and engineering. Visionary papers on new and emerging topics are also welcome, as are application-oriented papers that make innovative technical contributions to research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Data Science: | Methods for analyzing social networks, time series, sequences, streams, text, web, graphs, rules, patterns, logs, IoT data, spatio-temporal data, biological data, scientific and business data; recommender systems, computational advertising, multimedia, finance, bioinformatics. 
  Big Data: | Large-scale systems for data analysis, machine learning, optimization, sampling, summarization; parallel and distributed data science (cloud, map-reduce, federated learning); novel algorithmic and statistical techniques for big data; algorithmically-efficient data transformation and integration. 
  Foundations: | Models and algorithms, asymptotic analysis; model selection, dimensionality reduction, relational/structured learning, matrix and tensor methods, probabilistic and statistical methods; deep learning, transfer learning, representation learning, meta learning, reinforcement learning; classification, clustering, regression, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, few shot learning and unsupervised learning; personalization, security and privacy, visualization; fairness, interpretability, ethics and robustness. 
  Submission Guidelines  
 Deadlines  . The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder or dummy abstracts are forbidden.  
 Authorship  . The ACM has an authorship policy  stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools  . Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper. Any use of generative AI tools must be disclosed and elaborated in the submission form.  
 Maximum authorship. In the research track, the number of submissions allowed per author is limited to | 7 | (seven) | maximum. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 7 by submission id, will be desk-rejected. 
  Authorship changes. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized | by submission deadline | . There | cannot | be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation. 
  Anonymity  . The review process will be double-blind  . The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to refer to your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools.  
 Formatting Requirements  . Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format  (also available  in Overleaf); Word users may use the Word Interim Template. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:  
 \documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}   Submissions must be a single  PDF file: 8  (eight)  content pages as main paper, followed by references and an optional Appendix that has no page limits. The Appendix can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc. The first 8 pages should be self-contained  , since reviewers are not required to read past that. Note that different limits will apply to camera-ready (see below).  
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  . Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification  that applies to all publications.  
 Resubmission Guidelines  . A paper that receives a Resubmit  decision during the Feb 2024 submission cycle may submit a revised version to the Aug 2024 deadline. A paper that was rejected during the Feb 2024 deadline could not  submit a revision, and could not  be re-submitted as a fresh submission to the Aug 2024 deadline. Please also refer to the FAQ for Resubmission  .  
 Resubmission must be indicated upon submission, along with the OpenReview forum id  of the previous submission. The resubmission should also include a summary of changes (limited to 5000 characters) in the submission form. The reviewers/AC/SAC will have visibility of the previous submission and reviews. We anticipate that Resubmit  papers that address the previously noted concerns appropriately would have a higher acceptance rate than fresh submissions, owing to the former’s selectivity and potential improvements.  
 Correspondingly, some of the fresh submissions to the Aug 2024 deadline may receive a Resubmit  decision for Feb 2025 deadline.  
 Serving as Reviewer  . To ensure that all papers receive a sufficient number of high quality reviewers, every submission must nominate at least one author who is a qualified reviewer (i.e., authors with at least three papers in KDD or other related conferences). Being named as a reviewer in the submission constitutes an acceptance and a commitment to carry out the regular reviewing load responsibly. Only if no qualified reviewer exists in the author list, nominate the best-qualified author for consideration by the PC chairs. Failure to provide a qualified reviewer when one exists in the author list, or failure to carry out the assigned reviewing duty properly, is sufficient ground for desk rejection.  
 Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent  . Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies.  
 Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. Note that submitting your research for approval by such may not always be sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by your IRB, the program committee might raise additional concerns about the ethical implications of the work and include these concerns in its review.  
 Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.   
 Reviewing Process  
 Reviewing  . Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews, overseen by an Area Chair (AC). At least one author per submission must commit to be a reviewer, carry the regular load, and submit all their reviews on time. If any author of a submission does not carry out the reviewing task in a proper  and timely  manner, no author of that submission will see the reviews of that submission during the rebuttal stage.  
 Any use of generative AI tools during the reviewing process must be disclosed in the review form. In particular, verbatim uploading of any passage from the paper being reviewed to any generative AI tool is forbidden.  
 Rebuttal  . Authors will have the chance to provide a response to each review during the rebuttal period. The ACs will consider the authors’ response to the points raised by the reviewers, as well as discussion among reviewers, to inform acceptance decisions.  
 Withdrawal  . Authors may request to withdraw their submissions only  during the rebuttal period. Such requests must be made in written form to the PC Chairs and are completed only upon their acknowledgment.  
 Decision  . A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.  
 Transparency  . By submitting paper(s) to KDD 2025, the authors agree that the original submission, reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.  
 Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy  
 All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. A domain conflict  (entered in Education & Career History) must be declared for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. A personal conflict  should be declared when the following associations exist:  
 candidate for employment at the same institution or company 
  co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months 
  active collaborator 
  family relationship or close personal relationship 
  graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation 
  deep personal animosity 
  In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere to ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy  as well as the ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  .  
 Any transgression that falls short of ethical standards will be investigated and may face disciplinary actions. Such transgressions include, but are not limited to, falsification, dual submission, collusion, pressuring any member of the program committee. Convicted misconduct may result in a 3-year ban from SIGKDD events for all  the authors.  
 Publication and Presentation Policies  
 Publication  . All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings ( 12  pages, of which 9  are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. That is, while we allow one more content page for accepted papers, we limit the references and Appendix to only 3 pages. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. The rights retained by authors who transfer copyright to ACM can be found here  . Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication  on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  
 Reproducibility  . Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. We are encouraging the (optional) use of the “Artifacts Available” badge in ACM’s Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.  
 Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two multi-authored papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the specified deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.  
 Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.  
 Official Publication Date.  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date for KDD 2025 will be confirmed at a later stage. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 What is SAMSI  
  
 The Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI), was established in 2002. SAMSI is a partnership of Duke University, North Carolina State University (NCSU), and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). SAMSI is part of the Mathematical Sciences Institutes program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences at the National Science Foundation. SAMSI is housed in the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  
 Mission  
 SAMSI’s mission is to forge a synthesis of the statistical sciences and the applied mathematical sciences with disciplinary science to confront the very hardest and most important data- and model-driven scientific challenges.  
 Vision  
 SAMSI is a formulator and stimulator of research. It conducts programs that target areas most in need of attention and most amenable to high-impact progress. Both established and young researchers from academia, industry, national laboratories and government come to SAMSI to define the central problems and catalyze the research that addresses those problems.  
 Visiting researchers are resident at SAMSI for periods of a month to a year. Postdoctoral fellows participate at the crucial, formative stage of their careers. Graduate and upper level undergraduate students are provided unique insight into the formation of research areas and collaborations. Every SAMSI program conducts workshops that inform and energize the statistical and applied mathematical sciences. Selective outreach programs to undergraduate and graduate students, high-school teachers and faculty from teaching institutions extend SAMSI’s impact still further.  
 SAMSI holds regular year long programs, and shorter summer programs, as well as an extensive education and outreach program. Some research programs focus on particular scientific problem areas, while others are defined by statistical and mathematical themes that cut across multiple scientific contexts. Each is led by national and international leaders in the statistical and applied mathematical sciences, coupled with strong involvement of disciplinary scientists. The programming ideas arise from many sources.
