 ABOUT   

 The first IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC ) was held in 1995 in response to the growing interaction between the fields of computers and communications. ISCC takes place annually, usually in the Mediterranean region, in locations such as Egypt  , Cyprus  , Tunisia  , Portugal  , Morocco  , Italy  , Brazil  , Spain  , France  , Greece  , and Tunisia  . This year ( 2024  ), the 29th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications will be held in Paris, France   by the summer, from the 26th  to the 29th of June.   
 ISCC sessions will include presentations on new research results and tutorials. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the computer and communications areas that the Call for Papers  considers. Accepted papers will be included in the ISCC 2024 Conference Proceedings, which will be subject to independent peer-review procedures for quality, and may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library  . Merit, relevance, and originality will guide paper acceptance. Best Paper Award and Best Student Paper Awards will be presented.  
 IEEE ISCC 2024, in its 29th edition, will provide an insight into the unique world stemming from the interaction between the fields of computers and communications. IEEE ISCC 2024 will provide an international technical forum for experts from industry and academia to exchange ideas and present results of ongoing research in most state-of-the-art areas of computers and communications.

  ISCO 2024 | What is ISCO?   
  ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.  
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.  
 Scope of ISCO   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Approximation algorithms 
  Branch-and-bound algorithms 
  Branch-and-cut-and price algorithms 
  Computational biology 
  Computational complexity 
  Computational geometry 
  Constraint Programming 
  cutting plane algorithms 
  Exact and parameterized algorithms 
  Graph and network algorithms 
  Interior point methods 
  Linear and nonlinear integer programming 
  Local search algorithm 
  Metaheuristic 
  On-line algorithms 
  Polyhedral combinatorics 
  Randomized algorithms 
  Scheduling algorithms 
  A bit of history   
  The first  issue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia in March 2010  . This first attempt gathered more than 200 participants in a beautiful mediterranean country. The plenary sessions as well as all the talks have shown the large spectrum of our Combinatorial Optimization domain. Pierre Bonami from University of Méditerranée, Gerard Cornuéjols from Carnegie Mellon University and Andrea Lodi from University of Bologna have given a Spring School on "Cutting plane methods for integer and combinatorial optimization".  
   
  A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Springer-Verlag in the Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics (ENDM): ISCO2010 ENDM volume  .  
   
  A special issue in 2010 DAM special issue  has been published.  
  
   The second  issue has been moved to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in Athens, Greece in April 2012  . This second conference has been organized with colleagues from the Athens University Of Economics & Business in the deep center of the famous town. From this conference, ISCO topics has been extended to Theoretical Computer Science aspects of Combinatorial Optimization. A Spring School was organized around "Mathematical Programming and Design of Approximation Algorithms" with lectures by David Shmoys and David Williamson from Cornell University, USA.  
   
  A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Elsevier in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS): ISCO2012 LNCS volume  .  
   
  Three special issues was dedicated to ISCO2012:

 Top of page | What is ISCO?   
  ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.  
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.  
 Scope of ISCO   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Approximation algorithms 
  Branch-and-bound algorithms 
  Branch-and-cut-and price algorithms 
  Computational biology 
  Computational complexity 
  Computational geometry 
  Constraint Programming

  A bit of history   
  The first  issue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia in March 2010  . This first attempt gathered more than 200 participants in a beautiful mediterranean country. The plenary sessions as well as all the talks have shown the large spectrum of our Combinatorial Optimization domain. Pierre Bonami from University of Méditerranée, Gerard Cornuéjols from Carnegie Mellon University and Andrea Lodi from University of Bologna have given a Spring School on "Cutting plane methods for integer and combinatorial optimization".  
   
  A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Springer-Verlag in the Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics (ENDM): ISCO2010 ENDM volume  .  
   
  A special issue in 2010 DAM special issue  has been published.  
  
   The second  issue has been moved to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in Athens, Greece in April 2012  . This second conference has been organized with colleagues from the Athens University Of Economics & Business in the deep center of the famous town. From this conference, ISCO topics has been extended to Theoretical Computer Science aspects of Combinatorial Optimization. A Spring School was organized around "Mathematical Programming and Design of Approximation Algorithms" with lectures by David Shmoys and David Williamson from Cornell University, USA.

  ISCO 2024 | What is ISCO?   
  ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited.  
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.  
 Scope of ISCO   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Approximation algorithms 
  Branch-and-bound algorithms 
  Branch-and-cut-and price algorithms 
  Computational biology 
  Computational complexity 
  Computational geometry 
  Constraint Programming 
  cutting plane algorithms 
  Exact and parameterized algorithms 
  Graph and network algorithms 
  Interior point methods 
  Linear and nonlinear integer programming 
  Local search algorithm 
  Metaheuristic 
  On-line algorithms 
  Polyhedral combinatorics 
  Randomized algorithms 
  Scheduling algorithms 
  A bit of history   
  The first  issue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia in March 2010  . This first attempt gathered more than 200 participants in a beautiful mediterranean country. The plenary sessions as well as all the talks have shown the large spectrum of our Combinatorial Optimization domain. Pierre Bonami from University of Méditerranée, Gerard Cornuéjols from Carnegie Mellon University and Andrea Lodi from University of Bologna have given a Spring School on "Cutting plane methods for integer and combinatorial optimization".  
   
  A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Springer-Verlag in the Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics (ENDM): ISCO2010 ENDM volume  .  
   
  A special issue in 2010 DAM special issue  has been published.  
  
   The second  issue has been moved to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in Athens, Greece in April 2012  . This second conference has been organized with colleagues from the Athens University Of Economics & Business in the deep center of the famous town. From this conference, ISCO topics has been extended to Theoretical Computer Science aspects of Combinatorial Optimization. A Spring School was organized around "Mathematical Programming and Design of Approximation Algorithms" with lectures by David Shmoys and David Williamson from Cornell University, USA.  
   
  A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Elsevier in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS): ISCO2012 LNCS volume  .

 The IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society and the world’s premier forum for researchers in the active fields of theory, design and implementation of circuits and systems. ISCAS 2025 will be held in London, UK, from May 25 to 28. The IEEE ISCAS 2025 Organizing Committee invites proposals for Live Demonstrations to be held during the conference. The live demonstrations will be carried out in presentation booths with ample space to set up a working system, whether it is an interactive software on a laptop, a hardware setup, or a system acquiring signals from a human. Conference attendees are invited to experience the demonstrations directly, to interact with and challenge them.  
 Authors are invited to submit a one-page demo description using the same page formatting as for regular ISCAS papers. The one-page demo description can be based on either already published paper as a demo for the first time or new paper submitted to ISCAS 2025. During submission of the one-page demo description, authors should select “Live Demonstrations” as the Primary Track and an appropriate topical subtract as the Secondary Track.

[Show full abstract]  state-of-the-art works, future trends impacting information technology, communications, and cybersecurity, focusing on elucidating the challenges, opportunities, and inter-dependencies that are just around the corner. This book is helpful for students and researchers as well as practitioners. ICI2C 2021 was devoted to advances in smart information technologies, communication, and cybersecurity. It was considered a meeting point for researchers and practitioners to implement advanced information technologies into various industries. There were 159 paper submissions from 24 countries. Each submission was reviewed by at least three chairs or PC members. We accepted 54 regular papers (34\%). Unfortunately, due to limitations of conference topics and edited volumes, the Program Committee was forced to reject some interesting papers, which did not satisfy these topics or publisher requirements. We would like to thank all authors and reviewers for their work and valuable contributions. The friendly and welcoming attitude of conference supporters and contributors made this event a success

 The main theme of ISGC 2023 will focus on “accelerating time-to-science through computing”. Over the past two decades, the scientific research had been revolutionized by the infrastructure of distributed computing and the concept of open data. Compute-intensive research has once been a barrier for many researchers. Nowadays, the cloud and distributed computing infrastructure could provide researchers immediate access to an unlimited amount of computing power and allows them to ask questions that may not have been possible. Moreover, the virtual infrastructure allows researchers to share large-scale data. Reducing time to science is something every researcher wish to experience.  
 Promoting the open data/open science collaboration between Asia Pacific region and the world, the Symposium offers an excellent opportunity to learn from the latest achievement from Europe, America and Asia. The goal of ISGC is to create a face-to-face venue where individual communities and national representatives can present and share their contributions to the solutions of global challenges. We cordially invite and welcome your participation!  

 International Symposium on Grids & Clouds 2022    
 ISGC2022  21 - 25 March, 2022  online, Academia Sinica Computing Centre (ASGC), Taipei, Taiwan, Website: https://indico4.twgrid.org/event/20/    
 The annual ISGC virtual conference will be held from 21 to 25 March of 2022. While the research data are becoming a real asset nowadays, it is an information and knowledge gained through thorough analysis that makes them so valuable. To process vast amounts of data collected, novel high performance data analytics methods and tools are needed, combining classical simulation oriented approaches, big data processing and advanced AI methods. Such a combination is not straightforward and needs novel insights at all levels of the computing environment – from the network and hardware fabrics through the operating systems and middleware to the platforms and software, not forgetting the security – to support data oriented research. Challenging use cases that apply difficult scientific problems are necessary to properly drive the evolution and also to validate such high performance data analytics environments.

 International Symposium on Grids & Clouds 2019    
 ISGC2019  31st March - 5th April 2019  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2019 & Soundscape Conference will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 31 March ~ 5 April 2019, with co-located events and workshops. The main theme of ISGC 2019 is “Efficient and safe processing of FAIR Open Data”.  
  
 To achieve the full potential of Open Data and Open Science, scientists should be able to focus on their area of interest and be shielded from the internal complexity of e-infrastructures and the needs to manually deal with the different data formats, input and output constraints of used tools, the authentication and access control and any other technical or technological obstacles that are still part of the current data processing and analysis environments. This is emphasized by the FAIR concept -- data must be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. New approaches are emerging, hiding the complexity of the underlying computing and data fabrics, exposing just integrated views through scientific portals and gateways, notebooks and other virtual computing environments that promise to enhance the efficiency of work with advanced and complex contemporary e-infrastructures. On the other hand, possible privacy issues related to the Data collected and new, easy-to-deploy analysis methods like those applying deep neural networks, remind us of the need for proper security tools and environments and create new challenges for dealing with private and sensitive data and derived information.  

 International Symposium on Grids and Clouds 2018 in conjunction with Frontiers in Computational Drug Discovery    
 ISGC 2018 & FCDD  16 - 23 March 2018  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2018 in conjunction with Frontiers in Computational Drug Discovery (FCDD) will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 16-23 March 2018, with co-located events and workshops. The main theme of ISGC 2018 is “Understanding Open Data: Challenges and Opportunities in the Deep Learning Era”.  
  
 The global move towards an Open science and its Open data policy is bringing its first results in opening access to fast growing base of scientific data. This leads to a new set of challenges for the e-infrastructures expected to be the Open Science foundations. They must deal with new demands in traditional areas of their expertise: increase storage and computing capacity, simultaneous access to different pools and warehouses of scientific data, strong access control for sensitive data and many other things at scale levels of magnitude higher than before.  
  
 On top of that, increased amount of accessible Open data brings also new challenges, most notably how to understand and interpret the fast growing base of available scientific data. Machine learning and specifically deep learning techniques are currently the most promising general answers to this challenge. However, to deploy these techniques at scale of global e-infrastructures is a highly challenging task, pushing forwards the limits of technology, management and operation.  
  
 The goal of ISGC 2018 in conjunction with Frontiers in Computational Drug Discovery (FCDD) is to create a face-to-face venue where individual communities and national representatives can present and share their contributions to the global puzzle and contribute thus to the solution of global challenges.  

 International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2017    
 ISGC2017  5 - 10 March, 2017  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2017 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 5-10 March 2017, with co-located events and workshops. The main theme of ISGC 2017 is “Global Challenges: From Open Data to Open Science”.  
 The unprecedented progress in ICT has transformed the way education is conducted and research is carried out. The emerging global e-Infrastructure, championed by global science communities such as High Energy Physics, Astronomy, and Bio-medicine, must permeate into other sciences. Many areas, such as climate change, disaster mitigation, and human sustainability and well-being, represent global challenges where collaboration over e-Infrastructure will presumably help resolve the common problems of the people who are impacted. Access to global e-Infrastructure helps also the less globally organized, long-tail sciences, with their own collaboration challenges.  
 Open data are not only a political phenomenon serving government transparency; they also create an opportunity to eliminate access barriers to all scientific data, specifically data from global sciences and regional data that concern natural phenomena and people. In this regard, the purpose of open data is to improve sciences, accelerating specifically those that may benefit people. Nevertheless, to eliminate barriers to open data is itself a daunting task and the barriers to individuals, institutions and big collaborations are manifold.  
 Open science is a step beyond open data, where the tools and understanding of scientific data must be made available to whoever is interested to participate in such scientific research. The promotion of open science may change the academic tradition practiced over the past few hundred years. This change of dynamics may contribute to the resolution of common challenges of human sustainability where the current pace of scientific progress is not sufficiently fast.  
 ISGC 2017 created a face-to-face venue where individual communities and national representatives can present and share their contributions to the global puzzle and contribute thus to the solution of global challenges.  

 International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2016    
 ISGC 2016  13-18 March 2016  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2016 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 13-18 March 2016, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC).  
 The theme of ISGC 2016 focuses on“Ubiquitous e-infrastructures and Applications”. Contemporary research is impossible without a strong IT component – researchers rely on the existence of stable and widely available e-infrastructures and their higher level functions and properties. As a result of these expectations, e-Infrastructures are becoming ubiquitous, providing an environment that supports large scale collaborations that deal with global challenges as well as smaller and temporal research communities focusing on particular scientific problems. To support those diversified communities and their needs, the e-Infrastructures themselves are becoming more layered and multifaceted, supporting larger groups of applications.  
 Following the call for the last year conference, ISGC 2016 continues its aim to bring together users and application developers with those responsible for the development and operation of multi-purpose ubiquitous e-Infrastructures. Topics of discussion include Physics (including HEP) and Engineering Applications, Biomedicine & Life Sciences Applications, Earth & Environmental Sciences & Biodiversity Applications, Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Applications, Virtual Research Environment (including Middleware, tools, services, workflow, etc.), Data Management, Big Data, Networking & Security, Infrastructure & Operations, Infrastructure Clouds and Virtualisation, Interoperability, Business Models & Sustainability, Highly Distributed Computing Systems, and High Performance & Technical Computing (HPTC), etc.  

 International Symposium on Grids and Clouds 2015    
 ISGC2015  15-20 March 2015  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2015 is held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 15-20 March 2015, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC). “Global e-Infrastructure for Global Challenges” is the theme of ISGC 2015.Nowadays, the world is facing complex and global challenges in climate, health, energy, safety that impact whole populations and that are not restricted by country borders. Being of continental or even transcontinental size, these challenges can be tackled only through collaboration between multiple user communities, crossing nations and regions. Such collaborations are complicated by fragmented research, where individual groups and nations merely solve isolated pieces of the global puzzle. While not a panacea, the global e-Infrastructure supporting international collaboration helps us work on the puzzle effectively, accessibly, and completely. The universality of the global e-Infrastructure concept must find its way into its proper implementation, resulting from close interaction and collaboration with communities that use it. ISGC 2015 solicits papers and contributions that show this interaction benefitting both sides – the global communities dealing with global challenges (and the pieces of the global puzzle) and the e-Infrastructure developers and managers who face new challenges of size and multiplicity of requirements. Topics of discussion include Physics (including HEP) and Engineering Applications, Biomedicine & Life Sciences Applications, Earth & Environmental Sciences & Biodiversity Applications, Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Application, Virtual Research Environment (including Middleware, tools, services, workflow, etc.), Data Management, Big Data, Infrastructure & Operations Management, Infrastructure Clouds and Virtualisation, Interoperability, Business Models & Sustainability, Highly Distributed Computing Systems, and High Performance & Technical Computing (HPTC).

 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2014 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan from 23-28 March 2014, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC).“Bringing the data scientist to global e-Infrastructures” is the theme of ISGC 2014. The last decade has seen the phenomenal growth in the production of data in all forms by all research communities to produce a deluge of data from which information and knowledge need to be extracted. Key to this success will be the data scientist – educated to use advanced algorithms, applications and infrastructures – collaborating internationally to tackle society’s challenges. ISGC 2014 will bring together researchers working in all aspects of data science from different disciplines around the world to collaborate and educate themselves in the latest achievements and techniques being used to tackle the data deluge. In addition to the regular workshops, technical presentations and plenary keynotes, ISGC this year will focus on how to grow the data science community by considering the educational foundation needed for tomorrow’s data scientist. Topics of discussion include Physics (including HEP) and Engineering Applications, Biomedicine & Life Sciences Applications, Earth & Environmental Sciences & Biodiversity Applications, Humanities & Social Sciences Application, Virtual Research Environment (including Middleware, tools, services, workflow, ... etc.), Data Management, Big Data, Infrastructure & Operations Management, Infrastructure Clouds and Virtualisation, Interoperability, Business Models & Sustainability, Highly Distributed Computing Systems, and High Performance & Technical Computing (HPTC).   

 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2013    
 ISGC 2013  17 - 22 March 2013  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2013 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei from 17-22 March 2013, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC). For more than a decade, ISGC has been tracking the advances in distributed computing across the Asia Pacific region and leading the development of regional e-Science activities and collaborations around the world. With the continuous support and dedication from the delegates, ISGC has provided the primary international distributed computing platform where distinguished researchers and collaboration partners from around the world share their knowledge and experiences. The theme of ISGC 2013 is Collaborative Simulation, Modelling and Data Analytics in Grids and Clouds. The global e-science movement is bringing with it fundamental changes in the way we produce, manage, understand and exploit data within worldwide collaborations. At its heart is the complex large-scale data analytics that takes place around the large data sets generated from simulations, modelling and physical instruments. ISGC 2013 will bring together from the Asia-Pacific region and around the world, researchers that are developing applications to produce these large-scale data sets and the data analytics tools to extract the knowledge from the generated data, and the e-infrastructure providers that integrate the distributed computing, storage and network resources to support these multidisciplinary research collaborations. The meeting will feature workshops, tutorials, keynotes and technical sessions to further support the development of a global e-infrastructure for collaborative Simulation, Modelling and Data Analytics. Topics of discussion include Physics (including HEP) and Engineering Applications, Biomedicine & Life Sciences Applications, Earth & Environmental Science & Biodiversity, Humanities & Social Sciences Applications, Infrastructure & Operations Management, Middleware & Interoperability, Infrastructure Clouds & Virtualisation, Business Models & Sustainability, Data Management, Managing Distributed Computing Systems, High Performance & Technical Computing (HPTC), and Big Data Analytics.   

 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2012    
 ISGC 2012  26 February- 2 March  Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds (ISGC) 2012 will be held at Academia Sinica in Taipei from 26 February to 2 March 2012, with co-located events and workshops. The conference is hosted by the Academia Sinica Grid Computing Centre (ASGC). 2012 is the decennium anniversary of the ISGC which over the last decade has tracked the convergence, collaboration and innovation of individual researchers across the Asia Pacific region to a coherent community. With the continuous support and dedication from the delegates, ISGC has provided the primary international distributed computing platform where distinguished researchers and collaboration partners from around the world share their knowledge and experiences. The last decade has seen the wide-scale emergence of e-Infrastructure as a critical asset for the modern e-Scientist. The emergence of large-scale research infrastructures and instruments that has produced a torrent of electronic data is forcing a generational change in the scientific process and the mechanisms used to analyse the resulting data deluge. No longer can the processing of these vast amounts of data and production of relevant scientific results be undertaken by a single scientist. Virtual Research Communities that span organisations around the world, through an integrated digital infrastructure that connects the trust and administrative domains of multiple resource providers, have become critical in supporting these analyses. Topics covered in ISGC 2012 include: High Energy Physics, Biomedicine & Life Sciences, Earth Science, Environmental Changes and Natural Disaster Mitigation, Humanities & Social Sciences, Operations & Management, Middleware & Interoperability, Security and Networking, Infrastructure Clouds & Virtualisation, Business Models & Sustainability, Data Management, Distributed Volunteer & Desktop Grid Computing, High Throughput Computing, and High Performance, Manycore & GPU Computing.   

 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds and the Open Grid Forum    
 ISGC 2011 & OGF 31  March 19 - 25, 2011  Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan    
 The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds 2011 1  was held at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan on 19th to 25th March 2011. A series of workshops and tutorials preceded the symposium. The aim of ISGC is to promote the use of grid and cloud computing in the Asia Pacific region. Over the 9 years that ISGC has been running, the programme has evolved to become more user community focused with subjects reaching out to a larger population. Research communities are making widespread use of distributed computing facilities. Linking together data centers, production grids, desktop systems or public clouds, many researchers are able to do more research and produce results more quickly. They could do much more if the computing infrastructures they use worked together more effectively. Changes in the way we approach distributed computing, and new services from commercial providers, mean that boundaries are starting to blur. This opens the way for hybrid solutions that make it easier for researchers to get their job done. Consequently the theme for ISGC2011 was the opportunities that better integrated computing infrastructures can bring, and the steps needed to achieve the vision of a seamless global research infrastructure.  
 2011 is a year of firsts for ISGC. First the title - while the acronym remains the same, its meaning has changed to reflect the evolution of computing: The International Symposium on Grids and Clouds. Secondly the programming - ISGC 2011 has always included topical workshops and tutorials. But 2011 is the first year that ISGC has been held in conjunction with the Open Grid Forum 2  which held its 31st meeting with a series of working group sessions. The ISGC plenary session included keynote speakers from OGF that highlighted the relevance of standards for the research community. ISGC with its focus on applications and operational aspects complemented well with OGF’s focus on standards development. ISGC brought to OGF real-life use cases and needs to be addressed while OGF exposed the state of current developments and issues to be resolved if commonalities are to be exploited.  
 Another first is for the Proceedings – for 2011, an open access online publishing scheme will ensure these Proceedings will appear more quickly and more people will have access to the results, providing a long-term online archive of the event.  
 The symposium attracted more than 212 participants from 29 countries spanning Asia, Europe and the Americas. Coming so soon after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the participation of our Japanese colleagues was particularly appreciated. Keynotes by invited speakers highlighted the impact of distributed computing infrastructures in the social sciences and humanities, high energy physics, earth and life sciences. Plenary sessions entitled Grid Activities in Asia Pacific surveyed the state of grid deployment across 11 Asian countries.  
 Through the parallel sessions, the impact of distributed computing infrastructures in a range of research disciplines was highlighted. Operational procedures, middleware and security aspects were addressed in a dedicated sessions.  
 The symposium was covered online in real-time by the GridCast team from the GridTalk project. A running blog including summarises of specific sessions as well as video interviews with keynote speakers and personalities and photos.  
 As with all regions of the world, grid and cloud computing has to be prove it is adding value to researchers if it is be accepted by them and demonstrate its impact on society as a while if it to be supported by national governments, funding agencies and the general public. ISGC has helped foster the emergence of a strong regional interest in the earth and life sciences, notably for natural disaster mitigation and bioinformatics studies.  
 Prof. Simon C. Lin organised an intense social programme with a gastronomic tour of Taipei culminating with a banquet for all the symposium’s participants at the hotel Palais de Chine.  
 I would like to thank all the members of the programme committee, the participants and above all our hosts, Prof. Simon C. Lin and his excellent support team at Academia Sinica.

  Scientific Program  

 Track 1: Physics and Engineering Applications  
 T1 | Submissions should report on research for physics and engineering applications exploiting grid, cloud, or HPC services, applications that are planned or under development, or application tools and methodologies.  
 Topics of interest include:  
  (1) Data analysis and application including the use of ML/DL and quantum calculation algorithms;  
  (2) Management of distributed data;  
  (3) Performance analysis and system tuning;  
  (4) Workload scheduling;  
  (5) Management of an experimental collaboration as a virtual organization, in particular learning from the COVID-19 pandemic;  
  (6) Expectations for the evolution of computing models drawn from recent experience handling extremely large and geographically diverse datasets,and  
  (7) Expectations for the evolution of computing operations etc. towards the carbon neutral. 
  Track 2: Health & Life Sciences Applications  
 T2 | During the last decade, research in Biomedicine and Life Sciences has dramatically changed thanks to the continuous developments in High Performance Computing, highly Distributed Computing and the raise of AI which was rewarded this year with Nobel prizes in both chemistry and physics..  
 This track aims at discussing problems, solutions and application examples in the fields of health and life sciences, with a particular focus on non-technical end users.  
  We invite submissions in the areas of e.g. Drug discovery, Vaccine design, Structural biology, Bioinformatics, Medical imaging, Epidemiological studies and other Public health applications. 
  Track 3: Earth & Environmental Sciences & Biodiversity Applications  
 T3 | Earth system and environmental sciences go far beyond investigating physical sub-systems of our planet: increasingly, we develop an understanding of the Earth as a single, highly complex, coupled physical system with living and dead organisms. For this purpose, information technology is widely used, for tasks from data taking and analysis to modelling of large parts of the earth system. Climate change has made research in this field mandatory, and supercomputing centres are getting involved in addressing the mitigation of natural hazards - in particular in Asia. This track as a part of ISGC 2025 not only invites contributions from the classical simulation or data analysis sectors: it encourages presentations on works that involve artificial intelligence (AI). Thus, we reflect that earth system and environmental sciences have been considerably enriched by AI techniques, in fields from weather-model downscaling over anomaly detection in measurements to surrogate models in digital twins of the earth system. Projects that emphasize open science, open/FAIR data, and effective communication with stakeholders are particularly encouraged to submit their work. 
  Track 4: Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities (SSAH) Applications  
 T4 | Disciplines across the Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities (SSAH) have critically engaged with technological innovations such as grid- and cloud computing, and, most recently, various data analytic technologies. The increasing availability of data, ranging from social media text data to consumer big data has led to an increasing interest in analysis methods such as natural language processing, multilingualism and (semi-)automatic AI-powered translations, social network analysis, usage data analysis, machine learning and text mining, and data sharing. These developments pose challenges as well as opening up a world of opportunities. Members of the SSAH community have been at the forefront of discussions about the impact that novel forms of data, novel computational infrastructures and novel analytical methods have for the pursuit of science endeavours and our understanding of what science is and can be.  
 The ISGC 2025 SSAH track invites papers and presentations covering applications demonstrating the opportunities of new technologies or critically engaging with their methodological implications in the Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities. Innovative application of analytical tools or international data space for survey and usage data, social media data, and government (open) data are welcomed. We also invite contributions that critically reflect on the following subjects: (1) the impact that ubiquitous and mobile access to information and communication technologies have for society more generally, especially around topics such as smart cities, civic engagement, and digital journalism; (2) philosophical and methodological reflections on the development of the techniques and the approaches by which data scientists use to pursue knowledge. 
  Track 5: Virtual Research Environment (including tools, services, workflows, portals, … etc.)  
 T5 | Virtual Research Environments (VRE) provide an intuitive, easy-to-use and secure access to (federated) computing resources for solving scientific problems, trying to hide the complexity of the underlying infrastructure, the heterogeneity of the resources, and the interconnecting middleware. Behind the scenes, VREs comprise tools, middleware and portal technologies, workflow automation as well a security solutions for layered and multifaceted applications. Topics of interest include but are not limited to: (1) Real-world experiences building and/or using VREs to gain new scientific knowledge; (2) Middleware technologies, tools, services beyond the state-of-the-art for VREs; (3) Science gateways as specific VRE environments, (4) Innovative technologies to enable VREs on arbitrary devices, including Internet-of-Things; and (5) One-step-ahead workflow integration and automation in VREs. 
  Track 6: Data Management & Big Data  
 T6 | The rapid growth of the data available to scientists and scholars – in terms of Velocity and Variety as well as sheer Volume – is transforming research across disciplines. Increasingly these data sets are generated not just through experiments, but as a byproduct of our day-to-day digital lives. This track explores the consequences of this growth, and encourages submissions relating to two aspects in particular - firstly, the conceptual models and analytical techniques required to process data at scale; secondly, approaches and tools for managing and creating these digital assets throughout their lifecycle.  
 Additionally, a significant additional dimension is the automated generation and provisioning of metadata, either from simulated data such as Digital Twins or from experiments that produce vast amounts of data beyond manual annotation capacity. The automation of metadata creation and their availability in searchable catalogues is crucial for aligning with the FAIR Data Principles, ensuring data is findable and reusable. This process is also pivotal in making data usable for machine-driven applications, notably in AI training scenarios." 
  Track 7: Network, Security, Infrastructure & Operations  
 T7 | Networking and the connected e-Infrastructures are becoming ubiquitous. Ensuring the smooth operation and integrity of the services for research communities in a rapidly changing environment are key challenges. This track focuses on the current state of the art and recent advances in these areas: networking, infrastructure, operations, security and identity management. The scope of this track includes advances in high-performance networking (software defined networks, community private networks, the IPv4 to IPv6 transition, cross-domain provisioning), the connected data and compute infrastructures (storage and compute systems architectures, improving service and site reliability, interoperability between infrastructures, data centre models), monitoring tools and metrics, service management (ITIL and SLAs), and infrastructure/systems operations and management. Also included here are issues related to the integrity, reliability, and security of services and data: developments in security middleware, operational security, security policy, federated identity management, and community management. Submissions related to the general theme of the conference are particularly welcome. 
  Track 8: Infrastructure Clouds and Virtualizations  
 T8 | This track will focus on the development of cloud infrastructures and on the use of cloud computing and virtualization technologies in large-scale (distributed) computing environments in science and technology. We solicit papers describing underlying virtualization and "cloud" technology including integration of accelerators and support for specific needs of AI/ML and DNN, scientific applications and case studies related to using such technology in large scale infrastructure as well as solutions overcoming challenges and leveraging opportunities in this setting. Of particular interest are results exploring the usability of virtualization and infrastructure clouds from the perspective of machine learning and other scientific applications, the performance, reliability and fault-tolerance of solutions used, and data management issues. Papers dealing with the cost, price, and cloud markets, with security and privacy, as well as portability and standards, are also most welcome. 
  Track 9: Converging High Performance Computing Infrastructures: Supercomputers, clouds, accelerators  
 T9 | The classical simulation-oriented computing is nowadays complemented by the machined deep learning approaches. This requires novel approaches to build and integrate high performance computing infrastructures, combining supercomputers, clouds, and specialized accelerator and artificial intelligence hardware. The integration of these different systems, often provided by different owners and different location, requires new ideas for distribution and federation.  
  This track solicits recent research and development achievements and best practices in building and exploiting these converging high performance infrastructures or their components. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to the followings: (1) Building and use of modern high performance computing systems, including special support for AI and DNN in particular; (2) Experiences, use cases and best practices on the development and operation of large-scale heterogeneous applications; (3) Integration and interoperability to support coordinated federated use of different e-infrastructures (supercomputers, accelerated clouds, …) and their building blocks; (4) Use of virtualization techniques and containers to support access to and portability across different heterogeneous systems; (5) Performance of different applications on these integrated high performance infrastructures. 
  Track 10: Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
 T10 | During the last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and statistical learning techniques have started to become pervasive in scientific applications, exploring the adoption of novel algorithms, modifying the design principles of application workflows, and impacting the way in which grid and cloud computing services are used by a diverse set of scientific communities. This track aims at discussing problems, solutions and application examples related to this area of research, ranging from R&D activities to production-ready solutions. Topics of interests in this track include: AI-enabled scientific workflows; novel approaches in scientific applications adopting machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques; cloud-integrated statistical learning as-a-service solutions; anomaly detection techniques; predictive and prescriptive maintenance; experience with MLOps practices; AI-enabled adaptive simulations; experience on ML/DL models training and inference on different hardware resources for scientific applications.

 Call for Workshops   
   
 ISIT 2025 plans to hold in-person workshops during the main conference in two days. Workshops provide an informal and interactive forum for participants to meet and discuss emerging research topics. The ISIT 2025 Workshop co-chairs particularly encourage submitting proposals that cut across disciplines with co-organizers from adjacent disciplines to IT, and also workshops at the forefront of technology with industrial applications. Proposals that focus on establishing or strengthening new research themes in information theory, quantum computing, cryptography, AI, LLMs, and economics are particularly encouraged.  
 Workshops are expected to be one full day in length, although half-day and two-day proposals will also be considered. The workshop's format is determined by their organizers, who are encouraged to leave ample time to foster participant interaction. Workshops may include a mix of regular papers, invited presentations, keynotes, panels, poster sessions, open problem sessions, and sessions that encourage the participation of attendees in active discussions.  
  
 Proposal Submission   
 Proposals should be submitted as a single PDF file via the following link: https://go.iu.edu/8qHi  .  
 Important dates for workshop submissions:  
 Application Open: | Aug. 30, 2024 
  Submission deadline: | Nov. 29, 2024, AoE 
  Acceptance notification: | Dec. 14, 2024, AoE 
   
 Funding  
 ISIT 2025 is anticipating about $12.5k in funding for each full-day workshop. Funds can be used to support the attendance of participants from adjacent communities who do not normally attend the ISIT. Funds will not be allocated to subsidize travel for regular attendees of the ISIT. These funds can also be used to enrich the workshop in ways other than through travel funds. The allocation of such funds is subject to the approval of the ISIT workshop chairs.  
  
 Workshop Format  
 We anticipate holding up to three full-day workshops. We will also consider the possibility of replacing one day-long with two half-day workshops. Note that for full-day workshops, lunch activities should be integrated into the schedule. Workshops are limited to three workshop co-organizers.  
 ISIT 2025 is anticipating about $12.5k in funding for each full-day workshop. Funds can be used to support the attendance of participants from adjacent communities who do not normally attend the ISIT. Funds will not be allocated to subsidize travel for regular attendees of the ISIT. These funds can also be used to enrich the workshop in ways other than through travel funds such as best workshop paper awards. The allocation of such funds is subject to the approval of the ISIT workshop chairs.  
  
 Selection Criteria  
 The following criteria are mainly considered when selecting proposals.  
 Novelty and Technical Strength: | The strength of the proposed technical area of the workshop and the invited speakers, intellectual interest, and relevance to ISIT participants. The creativity of the workshop structure for encouraging interaction and fostering connections. 
  Accessibility: | The extent to which organizers and invited speakers, who do not regularly attend the ISIT, are included as a core part of the program. The degree to which the proposal complements, rather than competes, with the main ISIT meeting. Accessibility to the ISIT participants so they can gain (or strengthen) foundational knowledge in the topic area. 
  Prior experiences: | Prior experience of the co-organizers and a history of relevant activities, a diversity of seniorities, and other measures of diversity are encouraged. 
   
 Proposal Application Format  
 Proposals must be up to three pages in length for the main body with an additional two pages of supplemental information about organizers, and (unlimited) references.  
 The front page contains the following information: | Full title: The workshop may include an acronym, which could facilitate recognition if the workshop is envisaged to have multiple editions over future years. 
  Duration and type: Half or full-day event. 
  Short abstract (up to 200 words): Explain the main ideas, highlighting the differences with respect to topics covered by the Symposium and the potential benefits to the Society and to workshop / ISIT attendees. 
  Keywords listing the main topics covered. 
  Expected number of attendees. 
  Main body: | description of the subject, motivation, notable publications in the area, relation with topics covered by ISIT, interactions with sibling communities, impact in terms of new attendees, and benefits for typical ISIT attendees. 
  Tentative schedule: | Describe the targeted mix of regular papers, invited presentations, keynotes, and panels (any subset of these would be acceptable), mentioning specific contributors if possible. 
  Publication information: | Would you like workshop paper authors to have the option to publish papers at the IEEE Xplore Digital Library: Yes/No. (Note that the possibility of this option is still being discussed with the IEEE, and we anticipate that such papers would not be labeled as “ISIT” papers on Xplore, since decisions on them would be handled by the workshop organizing committee and not the ISIT TPC. While both posters and papers/talks are possible, the possible publication of contributions in IEEE Xplore would be limited to papers presented in as talks.) 
  Budgeting: | Anticipating roughly $12.5k in funding per full-day workshop, whose participation do you propose to support? Please note that funds must be used only for attendees that do not normally attend the ISIT. Besides travel support, how else would you suggest using the funds?

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

  They will then receive feedback on how to improve their proposal by September 1, 2024 
   
 Bid Content:  
 The following questions should be answered for the official bid (both draft and final proposals). Please stick to the proposed structure as best as possible.  
 1. Proposed Chairs/Organizational Team   
 1.1. Who are the proposed General Conference Chairs (provide names and 200-word bios)?  
 1.2. What experience have the proposed General Conference Chairs with organizing previous ISMAR conferences, or other academic conferences (in particular IEEE sponsored conferences)?  
 1.3. What other local people will help them with the conference organization? Can you already designate specific people for specific tasks?  
  
 Note: The organizers (General Chairs) are responsible and may appoint Chairs for the various tasks at their discretion. They may also propose Program Chairs, but these ultimately will be appointed by the ISMAR Steering Committee.  
 1. Proposed Chairs/Organizational Team   
 1.1. Who are the proposed General Conference Chairs (provide 2 names and 200-word bios for each)?  
 1.2. What experience have the proposed General Conference Chairs with organizing previous ISMAR conferences, or other academic conferences (in particular IEEE sponsored conferences)?  
 1.3. What other people will help them with the conference organization? Can you already designate specific people for specific tasks? Which local people will be involved?  
  
 Note: Please note that the General Chairs will typically be complemented by General Chairs from the previous and following conferences. The organizers (General Chairs) are responsible and may appoint chairs for the various tasks other than the technical program at their discretion. They may also nominate candidates for Program Chairs, but these are always ultimately appointed by the ISMAR Steering Committee.  
 2. Proposed Conference Location/Facilities   
 2.1. Which city or metropolitan area is proposed for the conference location?  
 2.2. Describe key local attractions in the conference city / area.  
 2.3. Describe briefly the conference site (e.g., convention center, university rooms, etc.).  
 2.4. Which conference rooms are available? (at least four large rooms to allow for parallel sessions, further rooms/space for posters, demos, exhibition, workshops, tutorials, meetings, etc.).  
 2.5. What audio-visual and WiFi facilities are available?  
 2.6. What catering facilities are part of the conference facility? What is the availability of local restaurants?  
  
 Note: ISMAR conference fees typically include lunch, coffee breaks, a social conference dinner, and a welcome reception.  
 3. Conference Dates and Schedule   
 3.1. What dates do you plan for the ISMAR conference?  
 3.2. How many days will the conference run?  
 3.3. What is the rough plan for the conference schedule for each of the days (sessions, workshops, tutorials, events, etc.)?  
  
 Note: Traditionally, ISMAR has been structured according to a scheme of 3 days for the main conference + 2 days for workshops and tutorials (either before or after the main conference). Instead of further increasing the number of parallel tracks, a 4 + 2 scheme could also be considered. In selecting the conference dates, you should take into account conflicts with related conferences (e.g., conference data for ACM UIST, ACM VRST, ACM SUI and submission deadlines for IEEE VR), national and religious holidays, and university teaching periods.  
 4. Conference Travel   
 4.1. Which is the nearest (international) airport?  
 4.2. Please give price quotes for the cheapest round-trip airfare to the conference location from Frankfurt, New York, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo and Sydney.  
 4.3. What transportation options are available from the airport to the hotels/conference venue?  
 4.4. Which visa regulations apply for participants (in particular from Europe, North America, Asia, ANZ, etc.)?

 6.2. What support can your university or industry department give for the organization of the conference (e.g., free secretarial assistance, facilities for on-line payment, etc.)  
 6.3. What support can your department give during the conference (e.g., free secretarial assistance, computers at the conference site, etc.)?  
  
 7. Safety   
 7.1. Are there any safety issues with respect to the country, city, region, conference site, etc. that might actually prevent people from participating?  
 7.2. Are there any vaccinations required / recommended for visitors from other countries?  
  
 8. Support for Students   
 8.1. What measures will you take to make the conference more affordable for students?  
 8.2. What budget accommodation is available for students?

 10.1. What is your approach to allow for a shared experience in a hybrid conference?  
 10.2. How will you cope with a situation where the conference has to be purely virtual?  
  
 Note: In contrast to some other conferences, we generally consider the option of remote participation to be useful. However, this does not necessarily mean that this option has to offer participants a similar experience. We do not expect a situation where the conference has to be purely virtual. However, plans for a backup option should always be included in the proposals, as pandemics or international conflicts and crises cannot be foreseen or planned for.h  
 11. Other   
 11.1. What new activities would you like to include compared to previous ISMAR conferences?  
 11.2. Any other aspects that you may find relevant for the evaluation of your proposal.  
  
 12. Proposed Budget (IMPORTANT!)  Here you can find the number of participants and key figures of the ISMAR conferences of the previous 3 years. We have observed an increase in submissions of around 20% per year. As can be seen in the table, this increase is not necessarily directly reflected in the respective number of participants due to the accessibility of the respective venue, but should give you an impression of how the number of participants is generally developing.  
  
 Year | Location | Participants total | On site | Online | Thereof students | Talks | Parallel sessions 
 2022 | Singapore | 679 | 461 | 218 | 305 | 165 | 2 
 2023 | Sydney | 598 | 448 | 150 | 288 | 177 | 3 
 2024 | Seattle | tbd | tbd | tbd | tbd | 180* | 4 

 Please also refer to the statistics about ISMAR in the past. https://ismar.net/statistics/

  student / regular attendee 
  Online / physical participation 
  The ISMAR steering committee can provide a sample budget from previous years if needed, as an example.  
 We are looking forward to your applications.  
 On behalf of the ISMAR Steering Committee,

 @article{tvcg2018_pcs_paper_1047 author = "Chakravarthula, Praneeth and Dunn, David and Aksit, Kaan and Fuchs, Henry", title = "FocusAR: Auto-focus Augmented Reality Eyeglasses for both Real and Virtual", year = "2018", journal = "IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (To appear)" }    
   
 Abstract  
 We describe a system which corrects dynamically for the focus of the real world surrounding the near-eye display of the user and simultaneously the internal display for augmented synthetic imagery, with an aim of completely replacing the user prescription eyeglasses. The ability to adjust focus for both real and virtual will be useful for a wide variety of users, but especially for users over 40 years of age who have limited accommodation range. Our proposed solution employs a tunable-focus lens for dynamic prescription vision correction, and a varifocal internal display for setting the virtual imagery at appropriate spatially registered depths. We also demonstrate a proof of concept prototype to verify our design and discuss the challenges to building an auto-focus augmented reality eyeglasses for both real and virtual.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Proceedings Key Dates

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.  
 - top -   
   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.   
    
 - top -   
   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference is vital for its role in uniting computer science, biology, and bioinformatics. It accelerates discovery by leveraging intelligent systems to analyze complex molecular data, enabling precision medicine and revolutionizing drug discovery. ISMB addresses big data challenges, educates researchers, and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, making it a critical hub for advancing life science research and applications.  
 ISMB is the flagship meeting of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) and has become the leading global conference in the field. 2025 marks the 33rd year of ISMB and is combined with the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB), which is in its 24th year. The ISMB/ECCB conference series aims at attracting the top research contributions in all areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. Typical, but not exclusive, the topics of interest are: sequence analysis, evolution and phylogeny, comparative genomics, protein structure, molecular and supramolecular dynamics, molecular evolution, gene regulation and transcriptomics, proteomics, Systems biology, ontologies, databases and data integration, text mining and information extraction, and human health. The conference also aims to attract participants from related disciplines in order to understand the need that exists for computational approaches in related fields, and to gain from approaches taken in other disciplines that might be appropriate for computational biology.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.

   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.

   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.

   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.
