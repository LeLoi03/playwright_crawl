  POPL 2019  ( series  ) /  BEAT 2019 ( series  ) /  BEAT 2019: Fourth Workshop on Behavioral Types  
   
 About 
  Program 
  Accepted Papers 
  Call for Talk Proposals 
  Behavioural types are abstract representations of the sequences of operations that computational entities (say, channels) must perform. Stateful entities offer services in a non-uniform way (one cannot pop from an empty stack); traditional type systems cannot guarantee that operations are only invoked when the entity is in the right state.  
 Context   
 Large-scale software systems rely on message-passing protocols: their correctness largely depends on sound protocol implementations. Behavioral types can help in the specification of correct-by-construction systems, and in verifying that programs respect their intended protocols.  
 Recent years have seen a steady stream of research on behavioral types: their foundations and their transfer to several programming languages. This has led to highly-cited papers in conferences such as POPL and journals such as TOPLAS. Research projects on behavioral types (in the US and Europe) have advanced the theory and applications of behavioral types. There is a sustained interest in specification languages, tools, and frameworks that bring behavioral types into programming practice.  
 Colocated with POPL, BEAT 2019 aims to enable a growing community to meet, present and discuss current work, and to foster (new) collaborations.  
 Invited Speakers   
 BEAT 2019 has the pleasure to have the following invited speakers:  
 Ugo Dal Lago, University of Bologna, Italy 
  Jan Hoffmann, Carnegie Mellon University, USA 
  Rumyana Neykova, Brunel University London, UK 
  Kirstin Peters, Technical University of Berlin, Germany 
  Peter Thiemann, University of Freiburg, Germany

 Rather than regular paper submissions, authors should submit talk proposals  , intended as engaging presentations of recent research results, possibly already published.  
 A submission to BEAT 2019 would typically fall within one of the following categories:  
 reports of an ongoing work and/or preliminary results; 
  overviews on recent tool implementations (or extensions of an existing tool) based on behavioral types; 
  summaries of an already published paper (or a recent series of papers); 
  overviews of (recent) PhD theses; 
  descriptions of research projects and consortia; 
  manifestos, calls to action, personal views on current and future challenges; 
  overviews of interesting yet underrepresented problems. 
  This list is by no means exhaustive but merely indicative.  
 BEAT 2019 will be an informal venue, oriented to interaction, and so it will have no formal proceedings.  
 Submissions based on already published works should include explicit references/links as appropriate. Reviewers may read such prior published works, but are not obliged to so do.  
 Submissions will be judged by the program committee on the basis of significance, relevance, and potential of an engaging, compelling talk at the workshop.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Submissions should be up to three pages (not including references), as a PDF produced using the EasyChair format  .  
 Please submit your talk proposal via EasyChair:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=beat2019   
 It is understood that for each accepted submission one of the co-authors will attend the workshop and give the talk.  
 Contact Information   
 Prospective authors are encouraged to contact the organizers in case of questions ( beat2019@easychair.org  ).

 CALL FOR WORKSHOPS AND CO-LOCATED EVENTS POPL 2025 52nd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages Sun 19 - Sat 25, January 2025 Denver, Colorado, United States https://popl25.sigplan.org   The 52nd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2025) will be held in Denver, Colorado, United States.  
 POPL provides a forum for the discussion of fundamental principles and important innovations in the design, definition, analysis, transformation, implementation and verification of programming languages, programming systems, and programming abstractions.  
 Events focusing on experimental and theoretical topics are welcome.  
 Proposals are invited for workshops and other events to be co-located with POPL 2025. All co-located events are sponsored by SIGPLAN ( http://acm.org/sigplan/  ).  
 Workshops should be more informal and focused than POPL itself, and include sessions that enable interaction among the workshop attendees. The preference is for one-day workshops, but other schedules can also be considered.

  Proposals must be submitted in PDF form by email with the subject POPL 2025 Workshop Proposal: [workshop name], to the workshop co-chairs: Christoph Matheja ( chmat@dtu.dk  ) and Robert Rand ( rand@uchicago.edu  ).  
 SIGPLAN Sponsorship   
 POPL co-located events are sponsored by SIGPLAN ( http://sigplan.org/  ). There are two kinds of co-located events: Conference-approved (no proceedings) and SIGPLAN-approved (proceedings in the ACM Digital Library). See http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Guidelines/Workshops/  for more information, including a full listing of prescriptions for Conference-approved and SIGPLAN-approved workshops.  
 SIGPLAN-approved workshops must respect the SIGPLAN Diversity Policy. Proposals for SIGPLAN-approved workshops must additionally include the gender, country of affiliation, and professional status of potential PC members. See https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Diversity/  for more details.  
 Selection committee   
 All submissions will be evaluated by a committee comprising the workshops co-chairs, the general chair, and the program chair.

 POPL 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 will be invited to present their work in the POPL conference in January 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
 Scope   
 Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing technical papers can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  .  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 POPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process (similar to the one used for POPL 2023 and 2024 but different from the lightweight double-blind process used in previous years). This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers. The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences for authors.  
 Submissions:  Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions. In addition, references to authors’ own prior work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  Supplementary material:  Authors are permitted to provide supplementary material (e.g., detailed proofs, proof scripts, system implementations, or experimental data) along with their submission, which reviewers may (but are not required to) examine. This material may take the form of a single file, such as a PDF or a tarball. Authors must fully anonymize any supplementary material. 
  Author response:  In responding to reviews, authors should not say anything that reveals their identity, since author identities will not be revealed to reviewers at that stage of the reviewing process. 
  Dissemination of work under submission:  Authors are welcome to disseminate their ideas and post draft versions of their paper(s) on their personal website, institutional repository, or arXiv (reviewers will be asked to turn off arXiv notifications during the review period). But authors should not take steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities to members of the Program Committee, e.g., directly contacting PC members or publicizing the work on widely-visible social media or major mailing lists used by the community. 
  The purpose of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors’ identities if they were to try. In particular, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the quality of the submission.  
 However, there are occasionally cases where adhering to the above restrictions is truly difficult or impossible for one reason or another. In such cases, the authors should contact the Program Chair  to discuss the situation and how to handle it.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  addresses many common scenarios and answers many common questions about this topic. But there remain many grey areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules or you encounter a complex case that is not clearly covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Evaluation Process   
 Like last year, POPL 2025 will use a double-blind reviewing process (instead of the lightweight double-blind process used in recent years). This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. For authors, the main change is that there is no option to upload non-anonymized supplementary material; only anonymized supplementary material may be submitted.  
 POPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.  
 As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.  
 The Review Committee (RC) will discuss papers electronically, and will use synchronous virtual meetings to discuss any papers for which there is disagreement among reviewers, in some cases soliciting additional input from other experts in the committee. There is no formal External Review Committee, though experts outside the committee may be consulted for some papers. Reviews will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee’s decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the decision.  
 To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL papers will be conditionally accepted; authors will be required to submit a short description of the changes made to the final version of the paper, including how the changes address any requirements imposed by the Review Committee. That the changes are sufficient will be confirmed by the original reviewers prior to acceptance to POPL. Authors of conditionally accepted papers must submit a satisfactory revision to the Review Committee by the requested deadline or risk rejection.  
 For additional information about the reviewing process, see: Principles of POPL  , a presentation of the underlying organizational and reviewing policies for POPL. For POPL 2025, policies specified in this Call for Papers supersede those in the Principles of POPL document.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://popl25.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Program Chair (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM July 11, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Conflicts of Interest   
 For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as “Other Conflicts (external)”. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace.  
 Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and proposals; for two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large companies or different locations of research institutes are considered to be the same institution; for two years after leaving an institution), between people with financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or relatives.  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Prior to the paper submission deadline, authors should upload their full anonymized paper. Here are some key requirements concerning paper submissions:  
 Each paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the acmart  LaTeX class with acmsmall  option). It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. The PACMPL template for LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  , and further information about PACMPL submissions can be found on the PACMPL author guidelines page  . PACMPL does not support submissions in Microsoft Word. 
  We strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options in order to make submissions easier to review. 
  ( NEW this year  ) Authors may choose which citation format they wish to use, which can be either author-year (the mandate for final versions in previous years) or numeric. 
  Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. 
  Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism  . Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. 
  Authors are free to submit supplementary material along with their submissions, but it must be fully anonymized. 
  Authors must list all their conflicts of interest (both PC conflicts and external conflicts) in the HotCRP submission form. 
  Authors may include additional information in a field of the HotCRP submission form labeled “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair”. This information need not be anonymized. It can be used to inform the Program Chair, for example, about sensitive issues concerning a conflict with a PC member or about supplementary material that cannot be anonymized. It is left to the discretion of the Program Chair what to do with this information. 
  If for some reason an author feels uncomfortable discussing a sensitive issue with the Program Chair (or communicating via the “Confidential Comments” field in HotCRP), they should feel free to get in touch instead with any of the Associate Chairs, with whom they can discuss the issue in confidence. 
  Submissions from PC members (except the Program Chair) are permitted and will not be handled any differently than other submissions. This is in accordance with a recent change in policy approved by the SIGPLAN Executive Committee: SIGPLAN conferences that use full double-blind review and whose PCs have at least 50 members need not hold PC submissions to a higher standard. 
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact submission is strongly encouraged but voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Copyright, Publication, and Presentation   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license  , which grants readers liberal (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a | Creative Commons license | , retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Authors of accepted papers are encouraged (but not required) to give a short talk (roughly 25 minutes long) at the conference, according to the conference schedule.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 At most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The selection of the distinguished papers will be made based on the final version of the paper and through an additional review process.  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science conferences have embraced double-blind reviewing. POPL has used double-blind reviewing for several years now as stipulated in the Principles of POPL  .  
 Q: Why are you using full  double-blind reviewing instead of lightweight  double-blind reviewing?   
 A: For about a decade, POPL used lightweight double-blind review (double-blind until PC members submit reviews). For POPL 2023, the conference switched to full double-blind review (double-blind until conditional acceptance). There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches, but based on our experience so far, the benefits of full-double blind seem to outweight the drawbacks.  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is relatively rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Yes, but we have mechanisms in place to prevent such an injustice from occurring. Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect. Moreover, if authors believe that their paper is being misjudged due to the constraints of double-blind review, they should feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity, and avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 If you believe for some reason that it is impossible to anonymize your paper without significantly weakening it, please feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair to discuss the situation.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository or I would like to provide a link to an online demo. How do I deal with this?   
 A: We discourage the use of external links, but sometimes the most convenient way to share suplementary material such as code or datasets is to include a link to a github repository or a google drive, but it is very important that they are fully anonymized. In particular, a link to your working code repository that exposes the identities of the contributors will be in violation of the double blind policy.  
 The same holds for online demos; reviewers should be able to visit the online demo and potentially browse its source code without being exposed to the identity of the authors (watch out for copyright statements, for example).  
 You should keep in mind that reviewers are under no obligation to review any supplementary material, including externally linked data or code, and reviewers may chose not to visit any externally linked material.  
 Needless to say, attempting to discover the reviewers for your paper by tracking visitors to a public repository or an online demo would constitute a breach of academic integrity.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: No. The relationship between systems and authors changes over time, so there will be at least some doubt about authorship. Increasing this doubt by changing the system name would help with anonymity, but it would compromise the research process. In particular, changing the name requires explaining a lot about the system again because you can’t just refer to the existing papers, which use the proper name. Not citing these papers runs the risk of the reviewers who know about the existing system thinking you are replicating earlier work. It is also confusing for the reviewers to read about the paper under Name X and then have the name be changed to Name Y. Will all the reviewers go and re-read the final version with the correct name? If not, they have the wrong name in their heads, which could be harmful in the long run.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: If the previous workshop publication resulted in a published paper, then your POPL submission will be judged on the significance of its delta with respect to that earlier paper. In that case, you should definitely cite the earlier paper as you would any other paper (i.e., in the third person, not revealing that you were the author of the earlier paper) and explain the delta. If, on the other hand, the work presented at an earlier workshop was not accompanied by a proper publication (e.g., if it was just a talk), then your POPL submission may very well have significant overlap with it and citing the workshop work would effectively unblind your paper. In such a case, it is not necessary to cite the earlier presentation. Instead, please mention it in the “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair” field of the HotCRP form so that the Program Chair is aware of the situation. When in doubt, ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: I want to cite some related work that itself cites an earlier version of my paper/system that appeared previously online. But that would effectively unblind my submission. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: My submission presents a technique that I employed in the development of previous papers but which was never properly described in those papers. If I mention that my technique was used in those previous papers, I am effectively unblinding my submission, but if I don’t mention it, reviewers may think I am ripping off my own prior work. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between (1) the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and (2) actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may  do:  
 Submit your paper to POPL, even if a previous version of it – under the same title or a different title – has been presented at an informal workshop, published on arXiv, or submitted to a previous conference or workshop. 
  Post your submission on your home page, your institutional repository, or arXiv, before or after the deadline (under whatever title you want). 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the PC, or with PC members with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, informal workshops, or job interviews during the POPL review period. 
  The above is not an exhaustive list: when in doubt, ask the Program Chair.  
 Things you should not  do:  
 Contact PC members (with whom you are not conflicted) about your work. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, POPL paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Chair.  
 Q: Will the fact that POPL is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call for papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective POPL author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: You should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, as explained above, it is fine for authors to give talks about their work (at workshops, job interviews, etc.), they cannot control who will attend their talks, and you as a PC member should not feel that you are prevented from attending their talks. Knowing (for whatever reason) that a paper was written by a certain author does not prevent you from reviewing the paper.  
 That said, if you feel that the authors’ actions are in flagrant violation of double-blind review, that is a point of concern. For example, if an author e-mails you their brand new POPL submission and asks to visit your institution to discuss it, that would clearly not be appropriate. There is a grey zone here, so use your best judgment, and when in doubt, ask the Program Chair how to proceed.  
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: You are under no obligation to follow any URLs to external supplementary material. If the submission is not self contained and does not convince you by itself about its merits, then the paper should not be accepted. If you ever have reason to suspect that your anonymity was compromised through your following of a link, please share that information with the PC chair immediately, as this would constitute a breach of academic integrity on the part of the authors.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers, e.g., you don’t feel completely qualified to review them, or if you know someone who would be the perfect reviewer for the paper, then bring this to the attention of the Associate Chair handling your paper, and discuss with them potential external reviewers (or other PC members) who might be able to provide an expert review. Then, submit a review for the paper that is as careful as possible, pointing out the areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. The Associate Chairs will manage the process of ensuring that papers receive sufficient expert reviews; please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. It is critical that you enter these at least a week before the POPL submission deadline. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, avoid using search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed.  
  These guidelines are largely based on guidelines for POPL 2023  , with a few modifications by Derek Dreyer based on discussions with the POPL Steering Committee. The earlier guidelines evolved from guidelines used at POPL and PLDI for a number of years, which originated in guidelines created by Mike Hicks for POPL 2012.

 Scope  
 The PPDP 2024 symposium brings together researchers from the declarative programming communities, including those working in the functional, logic, answer-set, and constraint handling programming paradigms. The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for analyzing, performing, specifying, and reasoning about computations, including mechanisms for concurrency security, static analysis, and verification.  
 Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative programming, from principles to practice, from foundations to applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability; concurrency, parallelism and distribution; modules; functional languages; reactive languages; languages with objects; languages for quantum computing; languages inspired by biological and chemical computation; metaprogramming. 
  Declarative languages in artificial intelligence: logic programming; database languages; knowledge representation languages; probabilistic languages; differentiable languages. 
  Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management. 
  Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects; semantics. 
  Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation; abstract interpretation; control flow; data flow; information flow; termination analysis; resource analysis; type inference and type checking; verification; validation; debugging; testing. 
  Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments; verification tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive theorem provers; certification; novel applications of declarative programming inside and outside of CS; declarative programming pearls; practical experience reports and industrial application; education. PPDP will take place 10-11 September 2024 at the Politecnico di Milano Italy, co-located with the 34th Int’l Symp. on Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation ( LOPSTR 2024  ) within the umbrella of FM 2024

 Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model  
 ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here  .  
 Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows:  
 Full details of the new | ICPS publishing model 
  Full details of the | ACM Open program | . Please direct all questions about the new model | here | . 
  Format of a submission  
 For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of the Current ACM Master Template  , at the time of writing being 2.08. You must use the LaTeX sigconf proceedings template, as the conference organizers are unable to process final submissions in other formats. In case of problems with the templates, contact ACM’s TeX support team at Aptara  .  
 Authors should note ACM’s statement on author’s rights  which apply to final papers. Submitted papers should meet the requirements of ACM’s plagiarism policy  .  
 Requirements for publication  
 At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to attend and present the work at the conference. The PC chair may retract a paper that is not presented. The PC chair may also retract a paper if complaints about the paper’s correctness are raised which cannot be resolved by the final paper deadline.

  POPL 2025  ( series  ) /  PADL 2025 ( series  ) /  PADL 2025: The 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages  
   
 About 
  Accepted Papers 
  Call for Papers 
  Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming. Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real-world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems.  
 New developments in theory and implementation fostered applications in new areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel and challenging problems raise many interesting research issues, including designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well.  
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving.  
 Student grants  
 PADL 2025 encourages students to participate in the symposium by providing some student grants to partially cover the registration and travel costs. You can apply by filling out the following form before December 16  :  
 https://forms.gle/Xr4HfxgNRxUAy7jv9   
 The selection process will give preference to students who present their papers at the symposium. Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

 Call for Papers  
  
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, databases and constraint programming, and theorem proving.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative applications of declarative languages 
  Declarative domain-specific languages and applications 
  Practical applications of theoretical results 
  New language developments and their impact on applications 
  Declarative languages and software engineering 
  Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications 
  Practical experiences and industrial applications 
  Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom 
  Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages 
  PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design, and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem-proving methods that rely on declarative languages.  
 PADL 2025 encourages students to participate in the symposium by providing some student grants to partially cover the registration and travel costs. The selection process will give preference to students who present their paper in the symposium. Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.  
 Submissions   
 PADL 2025 welcomes regular papers (max. 15 pages, excluding references)  and short papers (max. 8 pages, excluding references)  that describe original and previously unpublished research results on  
 complex and/or real-world applications in industry or in other areas of research, that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages, 
  tools and/or systems developed for such applications, and/or to improve practical aspects of declarative languages, 
  technical results related to the practical aspects of declarative languages. 
  Application and systems descriptions, engineering solutions, and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are in particular solicited. Regular and short papers will be published in the formal proceedings.  
 PADL 2025 also welcomes extended abstracts (max. 3 pages)  on the topics above, that describe new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication. Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings.  
 All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, see https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   
 The review process of PADL 2025 is double-anonymous  . In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgments that might identify you.  
 Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.  
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain} \usepackage{lineno} \linenumbers    The conference proceedings of PADL 2025 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published Workshop proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared. Previous PADL proceedings  can be found on SpringerLink  .  
 Papers should be submitted electronically via EquinOCS  (registration is required if you do not have an account).  
 Distinguished Papers   
 The authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)  , and for papers related to functional programming, in Journal of Functional Programming (JFP)  . The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended: explanations for which there was no space, illuminating examples and proofs, additional definitions and theorems, further experimental results, implementational details and feedback from practical/engineering use, extended discussion of related work, and so on. These submissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process by the journal, although with the aim of a swifter review process by reusing original reviews from PADL.

 POPL 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 will be invited to present their work in the POPL conference in January 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
 Scope   
 Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing technical papers can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  .  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 POPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process (similar to the one used for POPL 2023 and 2024 but different from the lightweight double-blind process used in previous years). This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers. The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences for authors.  
 Submissions:  Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions. In addition, references to authors’ own prior work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  Supplementary material:  Authors are permitted to provide supplementary material (e.g., detailed proofs, proof scripts, system implementations, or experimental data) along with their submission, which reviewers may (but are not required to) examine. This material may take the form of a single file, such as a PDF or a tarball. Authors must fully anonymize any supplementary material. 
  Author response:  In responding to reviews, authors should not say anything that reveals their identity, since author identities will not be revealed to reviewers at that stage of the reviewing process. 
  Dissemination of work under submission:  Authors are welcome to disseminate their ideas and post draft versions of their paper(s) on their personal website, institutional repository, or arXiv (reviewers will be asked to turn off arXiv notifications during the review period). But authors should not take steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities to members of the Program Committee, e.g., directly contacting PC members or publicizing the work on widely-visible social media or major mailing lists used by the community. 
  The purpose of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors’ identities if they were to try. In particular, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the quality of the submission.  
 However, there are occasionally cases where adhering to the above restrictions is truly difficult or impossible for one reason or another. In such cases, the authors should contact the Program Chair  to discuss the situation and how to handle it.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  addresses many common scenarios and answers many common questions about this topic. But there remain many grey areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules or you encounter a complex case that is not clearly covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Evaluation Process   
 Like last year, POPL 2025 will use a double-blind reviewing process (instead of the lightweight double-blind process used in recent years). This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. For authors, the main change is that there is no option to upload non-anonymized supplementary material; only anonymized supplementary material may be submitted.  
 POPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.  
 As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.  
 The Review Committee (RC) will discuss papers electronically, and will use synchronous virtual meetings to discuss any papers for which there is disagreement among reviewers, in some cases soliciting additional input from other experts in the committee. There is no formal External Review Committee, though experts outside the committee may be consulted for some papers. Reviews will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee’s decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the decision.  
 To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL papers will be conditionally accepted; authors will be required to submit a short description of the changes made to the final version of the paper, including how the changes address any requirements imposed by the Review Committee. That the changes are sufficient will be confirmed by the original reviewers prior to acceptance to POPL. Authors of conditionally accepted papers must submit a satisfactory revision to the Review Committee by the requested deadline or risk rejection.  
 For additional information about the reviewing process, see: Principles of POPL  , a presentation of the underlying organizational and reviewing policies for POPL. For POPL 2025, policies specified in this Call for Papers supersede those in the Principles of POPL document.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://popl25.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Program Chair (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM July 11, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Conflicts of Interest   
 For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as “Other Conflicts (external)”. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace.  
 Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and proposals; for two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large companies or different locations of research institutes are considered to be the same institution; for two years after leaving an institution), between people with financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or relatives.  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Prior to the paper submission deadline, authors should upload their full anonymized paper. Here are some key requirements concerning paper submissions:  
 Each paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the acmart  LaTeX class with acmsmall  option). It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. The PACMPL template for LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  , and further information about PACMPL submissions can be found on the PACMPL author guidelines page  . PACMPL does not support submissions in Microsoft Word. 
  We strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options in order to make submissions easier to review. 
  ( NEW this year  ) Authors may choose which citation format they wish to use, which can be either author-year (the mandate for final versions in previous years) or numeric. 
  Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. 
  Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism  . Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. 
  Authors are free to submit supplementary material along with their submissions, but it must be fully anonymized. 
  Authors must list all their conflicts of interest (both PC conflicts and external conflicts) in the HotCRP submission form. 
  Authors may include additional information in a field of the HotCRP submission form labeled “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair”. This information need not be anonymized. It can be used to inform the Program Chair, for example, about sensitive issues concerning a conflict with a PC member or about supplementary material that cannot be anonymized. It is left to the discretion of the Program Chair what to do with this information. 
  If for some reason an author feels uncomfortable discussing a sensitive issue with the Program Chair (or communicating via the “Confidential Comments” field in HotCRP), they should feel free to get in touch instead with any of the Associate Chairs, with whom they can discuss the issue in confidence. 
  Submissions from PC members (except the Program Chair) are permitted and will not be handled any differently than other submissions. This is in accordance with a recent change in policy approved by the SIGPLAN Executive Committee: SIGPLAN conferences that use full double-blind review and whose PCs have at least 50 members need not hold PC submissions to a higher standard. 
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact submission is strongly encouraged but voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Copyright, Publication, and Presentation   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license  , which grants readers liberal (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a | Creative Commons license | , retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Authors of accepted papers are encouraged (but not required) to give a short talk (roughly 25 minutes long) at the conference, according to the conference schedule.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 At most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The selection of the distinguished papers will be made based on the final version of the paper and through an additional review process.  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science conferences have embraced double-blind reviewing. POPL has used double-blind reviewing for several years now as stipulated in the Principles of POPL  .  
 Q: Why are you using full  double-blind reviewing instead of lightweight  double-blind reviewing?   
 A: For about a decade, POPL used lightweight double-blind review (double-blind until PC members submit reviews). For POPL 2023, the conference switched to full double-blind review (double-blind until conditional acceptance). There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches, but based on our experience so far, the benefits of full-double blind seem to outweight the drawbacks.  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is relatively rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Yes, but we have mechanisms in place to prevent such an injustice from occurring. Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect. Moreover, if authors believe that their paper is being misjudged due to the constraints of double-blind review, they should feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity, and avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 If you believe for some reason that it is impossible to anonymize your paper without significantly weakening it, please feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair to discuss the situation.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository or I would like to provide a link to an online demo. How do I deal with this?   
 A: We discourage the use of external links, but sometimes the most convenient way to share suplementary material such as code or datasets is to include a link to a github repository or a google drive, but it is very important that they are fully anonymized. In particular, a link to your working code repository that exposes the identities of the contributors will be in violation of the double blind policy.  
 The same holds for online demos; reviewers should be able to visit the online demo and potentially browse its source code without being exposed to the identity of the authors (watch out for copyright statements, for example).  
 You should keep in mind that reviewers are under no obligation to review any supplementary material, including externally linked data or code, and reviewers may chose not to visit any externally linked material.  
 Needless to say, attempting to discover the reviewers for your paper by tracking visitors to a public repository or an online demo would constitute a breach of academic integrity.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: No. The relationship between systems and authors changes over time, so there will be at least some doubt about authorship. Increasing this doubt by changing the system name would help with anonymity, but it would compromise the research process. In particular, changing the name requires explaining a lot about the system again because you can’t just refer to the existing papers, which use the proper name. Not citing these papers runs the risk of the reviewers who know about the existing system thinking you are replicating earlier work. It is also confusing for the reviewers to read about the paper under Name X and then have the name be changed to Name Y. Will all the reviewers go and re-read the final version with the correct name? If not, they have the wrong name in their heads, which could be harmful in the long run.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: If the previous workshop publication resulted in a published paper, then your POPL submission will be judged on the significance of its delta with respect to that earlier paper. In that case, you should definitely cite the earlier paper as you would any other paper (i.e., in the third person, not revealing that you were the author of the earlier paper) and explain the delta. If, on the other hand, the work presented at an earlier workshop was not accompanied by a proper publication (e.g., if it was just a talk), then your POPL submission may very well have significant overlap with it and citing the workshop work would effectively unblind your paper. In such a case, it is not necessary to cite the earlier presentation. Instead, please mention it in the “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair” field of the HotCRP form so that the Program Chair is aware of the situation. When in doubt, ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: I want to cite some related work that itself cites an earlier version of my paper/system that appeared previously online. But that would effectively unblind my submission. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: My submission presents a technique that I employed in the development of previous papers but which was never properly described in those papers. If I mention that my technique was used in those previous papers, I am effectively unblinding my submission, but if I don’t mention it, reviewers may think I am ripping off my own prior work. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between (1) the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and (2) actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may  do:  
 Submit your paper to POPL, even if a previous version of it – under the same title or a different title – has been presented at an informal workshop, published on arXiv, or submitted to a previous conference or workshop. 
  Post your submission on your home page, your institutional repository, or arXiv, before or after the deadline (under whatever title you want). 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the PC, or with PC members with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, informal workshops, or job interviews during the POPL review period. 
  The above is not an exhaustive list: when in doubt, ask the Program Chair.  
 Things you should not  do:  
 Contact PC members (with whom you are not conflicted) about your work. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, POPL paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Chair.  
 Q: Will the fact that POPL is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call for papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective POPL author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: You should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, as explained above, it is fine for authors to give talks about their work (at workshops, job interviews, etc.), they cannot control who will attend their talks, and you as a PC member should not feel that you are prevented from attending their talks. Knowing (for whatever reason) that a paper was written by a certain author does not prevent you from reviewing the paper.  
 That said, if you feel that the authors’ actions are in flagrant violation of double-blind review, that is a point of concern. For example, if an author e-mails you their brand new POPL submission and asks to visit your institution to discuss it, that would clearly not be appropriate. There is a grey zone here, so use your best judgment, and when in doubt, ask the Program Chair how to proceed.  
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: You are under no obligation to follow any URLs to external supplementary material. If the submission is not self contained and does not convince you by itself about its merits, then the paper should not be accepted. If you ever have reason to suspect that your anonymity was compromised through your following of a link, please share that information with the PC chair immediately, as this would constitute a breach of academic integrity on the part of the authors.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers, e.g., you don’t feel completely qualified to review them, or if you know someone who would be the perfect reviewer for the paper, then bring this to the attention of the Associate Chair handling your paper, and discuss with them potential external reviewers (or other PC members) who might be able to provide an expert review. Then, submit a review for the paper that is as careful as possible, pointing out the areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. The Associate Chairs will manage the process of ensuring that papers receive sufficient expert reviews; please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. It is critical that you enter these at least a week before the POPL submission deadline. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, avoid using search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed.  
  These guidelines are largely based on guidelines for POPL 2023  , with a few modifications by Derek Dreyer based on discussions with the POPL Steering Committee. The earlier guidelines evolved from guidelines used at POPL and PLDI for a number of years, which originated in guidelines created by Mike Hicks for POPL 2012.

 ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming 2025  
   
 March 1st – March 5th, 2025, Las Vegas, NV   
 Co-located with CC, CGO and HPCA   
 PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems, grids, accelerators such as ASICs, GPUs, FPGAs, data centers, clouds, large-scale machines, and quantum computers). PPoPP is interested in all aspects related to improving the productivity of parallel programming on modern architectures. PPoPP is also interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of large-scale scientific or enterprise workloads.  
 Proceedings will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems; grids; datacenters; clouds; and large scale machines). Given the rise of parallel architectures in the consumer market (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices) and data centers, PPoPP is particularly interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of extreme-scale applications or cloud platforms, as well as techniques and tools that improve the productivity of parallel programming or work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures.  
 Proceedings will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

  Scope:   
 PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems, grids, accelerators such as ASICs, GPUs, FPGAs, data centers, clouds, large scale machines, and quantum computers). PPoPP is interested in all aspects related to improving the productivity of parallel programming on modern architectures. PPoPP is also interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of large-scale scientific or enterprise workloads.  
 Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 Languages, compilers, and runtime systems for parallel programs 
  Concurrent data structures 
  Development, analysis, or management tools 
  Fault tolerance for parallel systems 
  Formal analysis and verification 
  High-performance libraries 
  Middleware for parallel systems 
  Machine learning for parallel systems 
  Parallel algorithms 
  Parallel applications including scientific computing (e.g., simulation and modeling) and enterprise workloads (e.g., web, search, analytics, cloud, and machine learning) 
  Parallel frameworks 
  Parallel programming for deep memory hierarchies including nonvolatile memory 
  Parallel programming theory and models 
  Performance analysis, debugging and optimization 
  Productivity tools for parallel systems 
  Software engineering for parallel programs 
  Synchronization and concurrency control 
  Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel programming and should contain enough background materials to make them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community. Papers describing experience should indicate how they illustrate general principles or lead to new insights; papers about parallel programming foundations should indicate how they relate to practice. PPoPP submissions will be evaluated based on their technical merit and accessibility. Submissions should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, compare to the existing body of work on the topic, and explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions and results towards addressing the problem. Submissions should strive to be accessible both to a broad audience and to experts in the area.  
 Paper Submission:   
 Conference submission site: https://ppopp25.hotcrp.com   
 All submissions must be made electronically through the conference website and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations. Full paper submissions must be in PDF format printable on both A4 and US letter-size paper.  
 All papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format using the 2-column  acmart  format: use the SIGPLAN proceedings template acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex  for Latex, and interim-layout.docx  for Word. You may also want to consult the official ACM information on the Master Article Template  and related tools. Important note  : The Word template (interim-layout.docx) on the ACM website uses 9pt font; you need to increase it to 10pt.  
 Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text (in a typeface no smaller than 10pt) or figures, NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references, and they must include the name of all authors (not {et al.}). Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.  
 Submission is double-blind and authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC and Extended Review Committee members, as defined here: http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/  (ACM SIGPLAN policy).  
 PPoPP 2025 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.  
 To facilitate fair and unbiased reviews for all submissions, PPoPP 2025 may utilize the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS)  to assign papers to reviewers. From the authors’ perspective, this decision means that the submissions may be uploaded to the TPMS.  
 Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, which deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be rejected.  
 All submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will be automatically considered for posters. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.  
 To allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive at least one ACM reproducibility badge, printed on the papers themselves. More information will be posted on the AE website.  
 Deadlines expire at midnight anywhere on earth.  
 Publication Date:   
 The titles of all accepted papers are typically announced shortly after the author notification date (late November 2024). Note, however, that this is not the official publication date. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. ACM will make the proceedings available via the Digital Library, up to 2 weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 ACM Publications Policies:   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy." https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects   
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. Please follow the https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmcgit/author-guidelines  link to see ACM’s ORCID requirements for authors.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems; grids; datacenters; clouds; and large scale machines). Given the rise of parallel architectures in the consumer market (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices) and data centers, PPoPP is particularly interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of extreme-scale applications or cloud platforms, as well as techniques and tools that improve the productivity of parallel programming or work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures.  
 Proceedings will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

  Scope:   
 PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems, grids, accelerators such as ASICs, GPUs, FPGAs, data centers, clouds, large scale machines, and quantum computers). PPoPP is interested in all aspects related to improving the productivity of parallel programming on modern architectures. PPoPP is also interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of large-scale scientific or enterprise workloads.  
 Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 Languages, compilers, and runtime systems for parallel programs 
  Concurrent data structures 
  Development, analysis, or management tools 
  Fault tolerance for parallel systems 
  Formal analysis and verification 
  High-performance libraries 
  Middleware for parallel systems 
  Machine learning for parallel systems 
  Parallel algorithms 
  Parallel applications including scientific computing (e.g., simulation and modeling) and enterprise workloads (e.g., web, search, analytics, cloud, and machine learning) 
  Parallel frameworks 
  Parallel programming for deep memory hierarchies including nonvolatile memory 
  Parallel programming theory and models 
  Performance analysis, debugging and optimization 
  Productivity tools for parallel systems 
  Software engineering for parallel programs 
  Synchronization and concurrency control 
  Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel programming and should contain enough background materials to make them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community. Papers describing experience should indicate how they illustrate general principles or lead to new insights; papers about parallel programming foundations should indicate how they relate to practice. PPoPP submissions will be evaluated based on their technical merit and accessibility. Submissions should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, compare to the existing body of work on the topic, and explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions and results towards addressing the problem. Submissions should strive to be accessible both to a broad audience and to experts in the area.  
 Paper Submission:   
 Conference submission site: https://ppopp25.hotcrp.com   
 All submissions must be made electronically through the conference website and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations. Full paper submissions must be in PDF format printable on both A4 and US letter-size paper.  
 All papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format using the 2-column  acmart  format: use the SIGPLAN proceedings template acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex  for Latex, and interim-layout.docx  for Word. You may also want to consult the official ACM information on the Master Article Template  and related tools. Important note  : The Word template (interim-layout.docx) on the ACM website uses 9pt font; you need to increase it to 10pt.  
 Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text (in a typeface no smaller than 10pt) or figures, NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references, and they must include the name of all authors (not {et al.}). Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.  
 Submission is double-blind and authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC and Extended Review Committee members, as defined here: http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/  (ACM SIGPLAN policy).  
 PPoPP 2025 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.  
 To facilitate fair and unbiased reviews for all submissions, PPoPP 2025 may utilize the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS)  to assign papers to reviewers. From the authors’ perspective, this decision means that the submissions may be uploaded to the TPMS.  
 Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, which deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be rejected.  
 All submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will be automatically considered for posters. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.  
 To allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive at least one ACM reproducibility badge, printed on the papers themselves. More information will be posted on the AE website.  
 Deadlines expire at midnight anywhere on earth.  
 Publication Date:   
 The titles of all accepted papers are typically announced shortly after the author notification date (late November 2024). Note, however, that this is not the official publication date. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. ACM will make the proceedings available via the Digital Library, up to 2 weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 ACM Publications Policies:   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy." https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects   
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. Please follow the https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmcgit/author-guidelines  link to see ACM’s ORCID requirements for authors.

In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems, grids, accelerators such as ASICs, GPUs, FPGAs, data centers, clouds, large scale machines, and quantum computers). PPoPP is interested in all aspects related to improving the productivity of parallel programming on modern architectures. PPoPP is also interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of large-scale scientific or enterprise workloads.  
 Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 Languages, compilers, and runtime systems for parallel programs 
  Concurrent data structures 
  Development, analysis, or management tools 
  Fault tolerance for parallel systems 
  Formal analysis and verification 
  High-performance libraries 
  Middleware for parallel systems 
  Machine learning for parallel systems

 Submission is double-blind and authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC and Extended Review Committee members, as defined here: http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/  (ACM SIGPLAN policy).  
 PPoPP 2025 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.  
 To facilitate fair and unbiased reviews for all submissions, PPoPP 2025 may utilize the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS)  to assign papers to reviewers. From the authors’ perspective, this decision means that the submissions may be uploaded to the TPMS.  
 Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, which deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be rejected.  
 All submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will be automatically considered for posters. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.  
 To allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive at least one ACM reproducibility badge, printed on the papers themselves. More information will be posted on the AE website.  
 Deadlines expire at midnight anywhere on earth.  
 Publication Date:   
 The titles of all accepted papers are typically announced shortly after the author notification date (late November 2024). Note, however, that this is not the official publication date. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. ACM will make the proceedings available via the Digital Library, up to 2 weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 ACM Publications Policies:   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy." https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects   
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. Please follow the https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmcgit/author-guidelines  link to see ACM’s ORCID requirements for authors.

Today, the conference series has evolved and welcomes works on all types of iterative optimization heuristics. Notably, we also welcome submissions on connections between search heuristics and machine learning or other artificial intelligence approaches. Submissions covering the entire spectrum of work ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies, are invited.

 [Closed]  Call for Workshops  
 Workshop Chair: Roman Kalkreuth  
 The PPSN 2024 Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with PPSN 2024. The workshops should be forums for presenting and discussing new emerging approaches or for critical reflections within a subfield. They provide an excellent opportunity to meet people with similar interests, to be exposed to cutting-edge research and to exchange ideas in an informal setting. The organizers of an accepted workshop are responsible for its coordination, publicity (i.e., for sending out call for papers/abstracts invitation of participants and speakers), and maintaining a webpage providing a list of accepted talks. Paper submission and reviewing (if applicable) is to be organized by workshop organizers.  
  Moreover, organizers can decide on setting up a half-day or full-day workshop. The workshop format is also up to the organizers. However, we encourage interactive sessions that foster discussion and active exchange of ideas. We suggest soliciting concept papers or abstracts of not more than a few pages’ length, instead of full papers.

 [Closed]  Call for Tutorials  
 Tutorial Chair: Fabrício Olivetti de França  
 The PPSN 2024 Organizing Committee invites proposals for tutorials to be held in conjunction with PPSN 2024. The tutorial topic should enjoy broad interest within the community, ranging from an established or emerging research topic within the field itself, or a related field, to an interesting application area. The proposed topic should facilitate a gentle introduction to the research area, but it should also cover the most important contributions in depth. The planned duration of each tutorial is 90 minutes. We strongly encourage interactive sessions including, e.g., demos of tools and discussions research perspectives in the presented domains.

 Welcome to PKAW 2023  
 Welcome to the 2023 Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW). In the past, the workshops have been held in Guilin (2006), Hanoi (2008), Daegu (2010), Kuching (2012), Gold Coast (2014), Phuket (2016), Nanjing (2018), Fiji (2019), Yokohama (2020, online), and Shanghai (2022, hybrid). PKAW 2023 will be collocated with the 20th Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2023) and held virtually in Jakarta, Indonesia in November 2023.  
 PKAW has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art in the areas of knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence (MI, also Artificial Intelligence, AI). PKAW2023 will continue the above focus and welcome the contributions to the multi-disciplinary approach of human and big data-driven knowledge acquisition and AI techniques and applications.  
 AI is changing the way in which organizations innovate and communicate their processes, products and services. Also, in our daily life, AI-embedded devices such as smart speakers are about to become widely used, which extends the possibility of acquiring knowledge from users’ behavior observed through the interaction between those devices and their users. Knowledge acquisition and learning from big data are becoming more challenging than ever. Various knowledge can be acquired not only from human experts but also from heterogeneous data. Multidisciplinary research, including knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning, human-computer interaction, etc., is required to meet the challenge. We invite authors to submit papers on all aspects of these areas.  
 Furthermore, not only in the engineering field but also in the social science field (e.g., economics social networks, and sociology), recent progress in knowledge acquisition and data engineering techniques is realizing interesting applications. We also invite submissions that present applications tested and deployed in real-life settings and lessons learned during this process.  
 Proceedings of PKAW 2023 will be published by Springer as a volume of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series.  For more details, please visit here  .

 Knowledge Structurization over Texts: Neural Information Extraction based Approaches and Recent Advances  
 Abstract  : Although recent large language models (LLMs) offer a friendly way to communicate and acquire knowledge from machines, they still suffer from inaccuracy and hallucination issues. In contrast, structured knowledge bases (KBs) can provide reliable, machine-readable facts while preserving human interpretability. In other words, knowledge bases containing these structured entities, relations, events and their semantic connections are currently crucial for powering intelligent applications. However, constructing such knowledge bases relies heavily on extracting structured information from unstructured textual data, with which one can populate knowledge bases with facts harvested from textual corpora in a scalable manner. The process is coined as knowledge structurization. In this talk, I will present the notion of knowledge structurization over texts using neural information extraction techniques, and then I will share our recent work on developing neural models for relation extraction and triplet extraction. Finally, I will discuss open challenges and future directions in improving knowledge structurization quality. I hope this talk will provide valuable insights into bridging the gap between unstructured texts and structured knowledge using neural information extraction. The techniques presented will push the boundaries of automated knowledge base construction.

 Welcome to PKAW 2023  
 Welcome to the 2023 Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW). In the past, the workshops have been held in Guilin (2006), Hanoi (2008), Daegu (2010), Kuching (2012), Gold Coast (2014), Phuket (2016), Nanjing (2018), Fiji (2019), Yokohama (2020, online), and Shanghai (2022, hybrid). PKAW 2023 will be collocated with the 20th Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2023) and held virtually in Jakarta, Indonesia in November 2023.  
 PKAW has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art in the areas of knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence (MI, also Artificial Intelligence, AI). PKAW2023 will continue the above focus and welcome the contributions to the multi-disciplinary approach of human and big data-driven knowledge acquisition and AI techniques and applications.  
 AI is changing the way in which organizations innovate and communicate their processes, products and services. Also, in our daily life, AI-embedded devices such as smart speakers are about to become widely used, which extends the possibility of acquiring knowledge from users’ behavior observed through the interaction between those devices and their users. Knowledge acquisition and learning from big data are becoming more challenging than ever. Various knowledge can be acquired not only from human experts but also from heterogeneous data. Multidisciplinary research, including knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning, human-computer interaction, etc., is required to meet the challenge. We invite authors to submit papers on all aspects of these areas.  
 Furthermore, not only in the engineering field but also in the social science field (e.g., economics social networks, and sociology), recent progress in knowledge acquisition and data engineering techniques is realizing interesting applications. We also invite submissions that present applications tested and deployed in real-life settings and lessons learned during this process.  
 Proceedings of PKAW 2023 will be published by Springer as a volume of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series.  For more details, please visit here  .

In this talk, I will present the notion of knowledge structurization over texts using neural information extraction techniques, and then I will share our recent work on developing neural models for relation extraction and triplet extraction. Finally, I will discuss open challenges and future directions in improving knowledge structurization quality. I hope this talk will provide valuable insights into bridging the gap between unstructured texts and structured knowledge using neural information extraction. The techniques presented will push the boundaries of automated knowledge base construction.

 Paper Submission  
 Submission Server  Instructions to authors  
 Accepted papers are planned to be published in Springer’s LNCS series. Submissions must not exceed 30 pages, excluding  appendices and references, and must be in a single column format in 10pt fonts using the default llncs class without adjustments. Additional material (datasets, code, long machine proofs, etc.) can be submitted as separate file. Reviewers are not required to read appendices and additional material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible and complete without them.  
 If the submission is accepted, the length of the final version is at most 35 pages including  references and appendices, in the llncs class format. The additional material will not be part of the conference proceedings. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published in a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings, or has submitted/is planning to submit before the author notification deadline to a journal or other conferences/ workshops that have proceedings.  
 The review process is single-blinded.  The submission should begin with a title, the authors' names and affiliations  , a short abstract, and a list of key words. Its introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submissions ignoring these guidelines may be rejected without further consideration.  
 All papers must be submitted with a meaningful abstract by the initial submission deadline. This is a firm deadline. Papers not registered by this deadline will not be considered. Authors may update or withdraw their submission at any time between the initial and final submission deadline.  
  Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

 IEEE PRDC 2025 |  
 30th IEEE Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing (PRDC) 
 Dates: TBD 
 Venue: TBD, TBD  , TBD 

 IEEE PRDC is the symposia started in 1989 that are devoted to dependable and fault-tolerant computing. PRDC is recognized as the main event in the Pacific area that covers many dimensions of dependability and fault tolerance, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental projects, and commercial components and systems. As applications of computing systems have permeated into all aspects of daily life, the dependability of computing system has become increasingly critical. This symposium provides a forum for countries around the Pacific Rim and other areas of the world to exchange ideas for improving the dependability of computing systems.

 The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI)  is an international event which concentrates on AI theories, technologies and their applications in the areas of social and economic importance for countries in the Pacific Rim. It aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, educators and users in AI and related communities for in-depth intellectual exchanges, research cooperation and professional development.  
 From 1990 to 2016 PRICAI conferences were held biennially in even-number years. In 2018 PRICAI became an annual event.  
 Topics:  
  Big data analytics,  
  Data mining and knowledge discovery, Information retrieval and extraction, Knowledge acquisition and ontology, Knowledge management, Knowledge representation, Machine learning, Natural language processing, Neural networks and deep learning, Reasoning, Text/Web/Internet mining, Semantic Web, Social intelligence  
 Recurring “Knowledge” Workshops:  
 Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW)* | The Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW), until 2019 the Pacific Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW), provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art in the areas of knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence (MI, also Artificial Intelligence, AI) | The first workshop in the Pacific Rim series of Knowledge Aqcuisition Workshops was the Japanese Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge-Based Systems Workshop (JKAW) in 1990 followed by the Australian Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge-Based Systems Workshop (AKAW) in 1991. JKAW was organized biennially until 1994, AKAW irregularly until 1999. The first time the workshop was labeled as PKAW was in 1996. Since 2002 PKAW is a regular part of PRICAI. | PKAW was also known as International Workshop on Knowledge Management and Acquisition for Intelligent Systems (PKAW 2012, 2014) / Smart Systems and Services (PKAW 2010) 
  “Knowledge Management” Workshops & Tutorials:  
 2020: 8th Artificial Intelligence for Knowledge Management (AI4KM) | The objective of this multidisciplinary session is to gather both researchers and practitioners to discuss experiences in various AI approaches and techniques applied to knowledge management and innovation. It includes methodological, technical and organizational aspects of AI used for knowledge management and feedback from KM applications using AI. Among the topics to address are: knowledge management methods, models, decision support systems, management advisors, virtual training, serious games, applications of machine learning to support innovation and eco-innovation, knowledge visualization for improving the creativity and human-machine interfaces, image mining making links between data and images ex bio-detection are good examples of multidisciplinary applications as well as knowledge management applied to global security and sustainability. 
  2000: Tutorial: The role of Artificial Intelligence in Knowledge Management | Knowledge Management (KM) is an emerging field rapidly gaining momentum both in the research arena and the business community. This tutorial begins with a review of the dominant trends in the development of Corporate Knowledge Management by linking recent work to the background of researchers. A number of AI areas/techniques are finding their way as strong enablers of KM. Most noticeably, Intelligent Agents, Information Filtering and Ontologies. Common KM applications will be described and these include, among others, knowledge maps and corporate memories in product development, software re-use, business processes and knowledge communities. Challenges and predictions for KM will also be outlined. This tutorial is especially suited to practitioners and researchers who want to learn about the field of KM and the major contributions of AI research and applications to this new field.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 'Memorable, unsettling and humane' GUARDIAN 'One of the best books I have ever read ... I can't recommend him or it enough' JOHNNY MARR 'One of the most gifted writers of his generation' IRISH TIMES Driving with a donkey stuffed in the back seat; jackdaws pecking brains out through the roof of a confessional box; cat piss and astronauts. This is not the world as you see it, but as it is, twisted from the maverick mind of Blindboy Boatclub. These are stories of the strange unsettlings in the souls of men caught in between the past and the possible; stories of heart-blinding rage and disquieting compassion. Blindboy Boatclub is the essential voice for the Irish condition in the twenty-first century, and in Topographia Hibernica he unravels the knotted threads of humanity, nature and colonisation from a contemporary perspective. * Topographia Hibernica was a bestseller in Ireland in November 2023 *

She's come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn't hurt. Lily can't get him out of her head. But Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his "no dating" rule, she can't help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.

 6.  Fiance Dilemma  
 by Elena Armas

 Josie Moore has given the opposite sex––and love––plenty of chances. Four exactly, if you count all her failed engagements, and five if you include the absentee father who kept her existence a secret until very recently. So when her father decides to announce his retirement with a splashy magazine piece about the family, Josie realizes her romantic history is a complicated PR issue. Matthew Flanagan is the mud, literally. Not only has he been fired from his job, but also the tires of his car are stuck in the muck after taking a wrong turn as he enters Green Oak, North Carolina. So, he grabs a duffel with his essentials and goes in b search of a place to crash until he gets his life back on track. But instead, he finds his best friend’s sister, Josie, greeting him as her fiancé. What starts as a big messy misunderstanding quickly turns into an arrangement with Matthew playing a new role as doting fiancé. A fifth engagement––and a stunt, at that––makes Josie’s stomach turn, but every dilemma requires a choice between equally undesirable alternatives, and Matthew doesn’t seem to mind becoming one more number in a colourful list of grooms-that-never-were. Despite the ring on her finger, Josie knows this is only temporary, even if the rest of the small town believes that the fifth time’s the charm.

Jack Carr, former Navy SEAL Sniper and #1 New York Times bestselling author of the James Reece Terminal List series 'Continuous action, Mach-speed mayhem, sharp intrigue, and well-rounded characters - what more could you want from a thriller?' Steve Berry, New York Times bestselling author of The 9th Man and the Cotton Malone series Israel, late 1973. As the Yom Kippur War flares into life, a state-of-the-art Soviet MIG fighter is racing at breakneck speed over the arid scrublands below . . . and promptly disappears. NASA Flight Controller and former US Navy test pilot Kaz Zemeckis watches the scene from the ground - and is quickly pulled into a dizzying, high-stakes game of spies, lies and a possible high-level defection that plays out across three continents. The prize is beyond value: the secrets of the Soviets' mythical 'Foxbat' MiG-25, the fastest, highest-flying fighter plane in the world and the key to Cold War air supremacy. But every defection is double-edged with risk, and Kaz must tread a careful line between trust and suspicion. Ultimately, he must invite the fox into the henhouse - bringing the defector into the heart of the United States' most secret test site - and hope that, with skill and cunning, the game plays out his way. For Chris Hadfield's second heart-stopping thriller, we move from Space to another rich and exciting part of Chris's CV: his time as a top test pilot in both the US Air Force and the US Navy, and as an RCAF fighter pilot intercepting armed Soviet bombers in North American airspace. Full of insider detail, excitement and political intrigue drawn from real events, The Defector brings us the nerve-shredding rush of aerial combat, as told by one of the world's best fighter pilots.

In the summer of 1974 a heatwave blankets Boston and Mary Pat Fennessey is trying to stay one step ahead of the bill collectors. Mary Pat has lived her entire life in the housing projects of 'Southie', the Irish American enclave that stubbornly adheres to old tradition and stands proudly apart. One night Mary Pat's teenage daughter Jules stays out late and doesn't come home. That same evening, a young Black man is found dead, struck by a subway train under mysterious circumstances. The two events seem unconnected. But Mary Pat, propelled by a desperate search for her missing daughter, begins turning over stones best left untouched - asking questions that bother Marty Butler, chieftain of the Irish mob, and the men who work for him, men who don't take kindly to any threat to their business. Set against the hot, tumultuous months when the city's desegregation of its public schools exploded in violence, Small Mercies is a superb thriller, a brutal depiction of criminality and power, and an unflinching portrait of the dark heart of American racism.

Dante Russo thrives on control, both personally and professionally. The billionaire CEO never planned to marry - until the threat of blackmail forces him into an engagement with a woman he barely knows: Vivian Lau, jewellery heiress and daughter of his newest enemy. It doesn't matter how beautiful or charming she is. He'll do everything in his power to destroy the evidence and their betrothal.

 A dangerous alliance between a Vampyre bride and an Alpha werewolf becomes a love deep enough to sink your teeth into in this new paranormal romance from the New York Times bestselling author of The Love Hypothesis. Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyre councilman of the Southwest, is an outcast - again. Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold an historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange - again . . . Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It's clear from the way he tracks Misery's every movement that he doesn't trust her. If only he knew how right he was . . . Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what's hers, even if it means a life alone in Were territory . . . alone with the wolf.

Now, he spends his days balancing business with parenting a sullen twelve-year-old, all while trying desperately to keep his hands the hell off his best friend's sister, Rosie Belmont.

He vows to keep her at arm's length. Tries to stick to scowls and grumpy one-liners. But with her, verbal sparring is a type of foreplay?friction that soon turns to blistering heat. Ford knows damn well he shouldn't cross this line. But shouldn't and can't are two very different things. And the only thing he truly can't do is resist her.

 #1 New York Times bestselling author Tessa Bailey is back in Napa Valley with this hilarious rom-com about a down-on-her-luck heiress who suggests a mutually beneficial marriage of convenience to a man she can't stand... only to discover there's a fine line between love and hate. After losing her job and her fiancé in one fell swoop, Natalie Vos returned home to lick her wounds. A few months later, she's sufficiently drowned her sorrows in cabernet and she's ready to get back on her feet. She just needs her trust fund to finance her new business venture. Unfortunately, the terms require she marry before she can have the money. And well, dumped, remember? But Natalie is desperate enough to propose to a man who makes her want to kill him-and kiss him, in equal measure. August Cates may own a vineyard, but he doesn't know jack about making wine. He's determined to do his late best friend proud, no matter what it takes. Except his tasting room is empty, his wine is disgusting (seriously, he once saw someone gag), and his buddy's legacy is circling the drain. No bank will give him the loan he needs to turn the business around... and then the gorgeous, feisty heiress knocks on his door. Natalie has haunted August's dreams since the moment they met, but their sizzling chemistry immediately morphed into simmering insults. Now, a quickie marriage could help them both. A sham wedding, a few weeks living under the same roof, and then they can go their separate ways-assuming they make it out alive. How hard could it be? There's just one thing they didn't account for: their unfortunate, unbearable, undeniable attraction.

 Scope and Background   
 The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI) is an annual global event focusing on AI theories, technologies, and their practical applications across scientific, social, and economic domains relevant to the Pacific Rim’s unique social and economic challenges. Previous PRICAI conferences have been held in Gold Coast (2014), Phuket (2016), Nanjing (2018), Fiji (2019), Yokohama (2020), Hanoi (2021), Shanghai (2022), and Jakarta (2023). The 21st Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2024) will be held at the Clock Tower Centennial Hall of Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The Program Committee invites technical papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all areas of Artificial Intelligence. PRICAI 2024 aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, educators, and users in AI and related communities for in-depth intellectual exchanges, research cooperation, and professional development.  
  
 Paper Submission   
 Proceedings of PRICAI 2024 will be published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) proceedings volume. PRICAI 2024 solicits regular and short papers. Regular papers may be up to 12 pages in length, including references, while short papers may be up to 6 pages, including references. All papers should be submitted electronically using the conference management tool in PDF format and formatted using the Springer LNAI template. Submitted papers must not be published or under consideration to be published elsewhere. PRICAI reviewing follows a double-blind process. Authors are unaware of the identities of the reviewers, and reviewers cannot deduce the names of the authors from the submission. Authors must refrain from including any information that might reveal their identities anywhere in the submission. Failure to adhere to this guideline could result in rejection without review.

 Agents are software processes that perceive and act in an environment, processing their perceptions to make intelligent decisions about actions to achieve their goals. Multi-agent systems have multiple agents that work in the same environment to achieve either joint or conflicting goals. Agent computing and technology is an exciting, emerging paradigm expected to play a key role in many society-changing practices from disaster response to manufacturing to agriculture. Agent and mul- agent researchers are focused on building working systems that bring together a broad range of technical areas from market theory to software engineering to user interfaces. Agent systems are expected to operate in real-world environments, with all the challenges complex environments present. After 11 successful PRIMA workshops/conferences (Pacific-Rim International Conference/Workshop on Multi-Agents), PRIMA became a new conference titled “International Conference on Principles of Practice in Multi-Agent Systems” in 2009. With over 100 submissions, an acceptance rate for full papers of 25% and 50% for posters, a demonstration session, an industry track, a RoboCup competition and workshops and tutorials, PRIMA has become an important venue for multi-agent research. Papers submitted are from all parts of the world, though with a higher representation of Pacific Rim countries than other major multi-agent research forums. This volume presents 34 high-quality and exciting technical papers on multimedia research and an additional 18 poster papers that give brief views on exciting research.

  How are ratings calculated?   To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we do not use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 PPSN was originally designed to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of Natural Computing, the study of computing approaches which are gleaned from natural models. Today, the conference series has evolved and welcomes works on all types of iterative optimization heuristics. Notably, we also welcome submissions on connections between search heuristics and machine learning or other artificial intelligence approaches. Submissions covering the entire spectrum of work, ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies, are invited.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-03-31

 CoDEMO EU project is dedicated to developing at the European level, innovation capabilities for 5.0 organizations in multiple activity sectors, namely industry, healthcare and agri-technology. Capabilities for innovation and transformation towards 5.0 organizations are deeply based on the capacity of collaboration among various socio-economic actors, including companies, innovation centres, vocational training providers, universities and others.  
 The concept of 5.0 organization complements 4.0 logics and principles by focussing more on developing a sustainable, human-centric, and resilient (business) environment considered as more appropriate in a non-linear world. The advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to strategically improve and optimize global supply chains (SC). With the help of networked technologies and smart digital ecosystems, 5.0 organizations aim to provide more sustainable means of value creation, better (business) results and advancements in SC resiliency.  
 The objective of this special session, is to make the link between the innovation and competence requirements for the transition towards 5.0 organizations and the needs, opportunities and practices of collaborative networks consisting of various types of socio-economic actors.  
 The Special Session will welcome theoretical, empirical as well as pragmatic contributions on topics like: collaborative network modalities to support 5.0 innovation & transition, 5.0 competence needs supported by collaborative innovation activities, collaboration needs/requirements for 5.0 organisations in specific sectors like industry, healthcare or agri-technology, experimentation of collaborative networks supporting 5.0 transition, assessment of collaborative capabilities for 5.0 organizations, 5.0 laboratories for education, learning, professional training or transfer. All other contributions that relate to the main field of 5.0 organization are also very much appreciated.

 Special Session 2: Fostering Collaborative and Interoperable Digital Models for Digital Twins  
 Digitization received significant attention by new European Commission strategies. To improve digitalization’s maturity, it is important to develop technology-driven frameworks such as digital twins (DT). The proposed special session aims at inviting approaches for developing FAIR (Findable Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) digital models for digital twins with a collaborative capability, which hold immense potential for various industries from manufacturing to healthcare. The development of mature collaborative DTs highly relies on high fidelity digital models that will be included within the virtual entity (VE) dimension of DTs, which includes different types of digital models, such as behavioural geometric, rules, physic, geospatial, and assets. In this session, we are looking for contributions and guidelines on deduction/extraction of digital models facilitating knowledge exchange that enables these models to be interoperable among themselves and integrate different information and elements to offer collaborative capabilities for digital twins. Such interoperable models, endorse collaboration among different DTs at different aggregation levels (i.e., Unit level DT, System level DT, System of Systems level DT).  
 This special session will be endorsed by the Digital Twin Technical Committee of the SAGIP ( https://www.sagip.org/fr  ).

 Special Session 3: Empowering Vulnerable Populations Wellbeing through Collaborative Networks  
 Vulnerable populations as migrants, refugees, ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, vulnerable women, low-income homeless, LGBTQ+ communities, etc., are often affected by different types of discrimination that beyond doubt affect their wellbeing. One way of mitigating this problem is to perform a comprehensive exploration of key themes aimed at enhancing the wellbeing of vulnerable populations through the lens of collaborative networks.  
 In this regard, this special session addresses concerns on how the stakeholders' engagement within these networks can be performed, with a focus on understanding how their involvement contributes to the empowerment of vulnerable individuals. At this level, it is also relevant to properly understand and evaluate emerging technologies and strategic approaches dedicated to ensuring confidentiality and trust within collaborative networks, acknowledging their pivotal role in fostering a secure environment for vulnerable populations. Furthermore contributions to this session may include research on mechanisms to facilitate agile access to data and fostering knowledge creation for vulnerable individuals, exploring cutting-edge recommendation systems continuous supervision, and monitoring methodologies, aiming to elevate the outcomes of networks designed to support vulnerable populations. A particular emphasis can be placed on the integration of generative-AI solutions, assessing their efficiency in providing tailored services that address the unique needs and challenges faced by vulnerable individuals.  
 In addition, in this session it is also welcomed research on user-tailored interfaces and adaptable digital solutions, aiming to create accessible and user-friendly platforms specifically designed to cater to the diverse requirements of vulnerable populations. Moreover the role of social media in the empowerment of vulnerable populations should be analyzed, considering its impact on communication, awareness and community support. Overall, this special session expects to include contributions for a comprehensive examination of collaborative networks and associated technologies, providing insights into their potential to positively impact the wellbeing of vulnerable populations.

 Special Session 4: Trust and trustworthy technologies in collaborative networks  
 Collaborative networks of enterprises are currently challenged by high unpredictabilities. The global environment has further developed from a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) into a brittle, anxious, nonlinear and incomprehensible (BANI) world. Given these conditions, timely and credible information sharing among collaborative network partners is but one of the vital sources of an efficient network. Research shows, that (re)establishing and pertaining trust in a collaborative network as a specific organizational form in general and between network partners and further stakeholders in a more specific perspective make up a key network management challenge. However, as the collaboration in larger networks becomes increasingly virtual and anonymous, especially if the distance of tiers in a supply network is high, trust can no longer be built solely upon personal relationships. Rather, it is the intelligent interplay of organizational, human and technological (digital) relationship enablers that substantially contributes to trust in collaborative networks in a BANI world. One particular innovative technology which addresses network trust is the distributed (digital) ledger technology (DLT) (i.e. "blockchain"). This session aims to strengthen the scientific discourse on the challenges of implementing and managing this trustworthy technology in collaborative virtual networks of enterprises. With respect to DLT enabled collaborative networks (in contrast to rather linear chains) we invite scholars to address, among other, topics as: dimensions and qualities of trust; psychological technological and/or organizational representations of trust; reciprocity of human and DLT trustworthiness; trust related managerial procedures, indicators and measures of successful DLT implementation; or even newly arising blind spots in understanding and managing trust and trustworthiness in DLT enabled collaborative networks.  
 Topics:  
 Trust in collaboration 
  Trust in virtual networks of enterprises 
  Reciprocity and interplay of trust enablers 
  Distributed ledger technology/ blockchain 
  Management of digital technologies in networks

 Special Session 5: Collaborative Manufacturing Systems in the Digital Era  
 The manufacturing industry continuously faces critical challenges such as supply chain disruptions, political instability, increasing competition, mass customization, and skill shortage. As a result, companies are implementing a more adaptive approach, leveraging globally dispersed, scalable, and sustainable production systems and resources. Also, these challenges force the industry to be more efficient, agile, and robust than ever. Collaboration between various stakeholders such as machine builders, product designers, manufacturers, and end-customers is one of the opportunities to overcome these challenges. Collaborative manufacturing effort involves sharing resources, knowledge, expertise and risks as well as the business gain while meeting the requirements of all stakeholders involved. This paradigm embodies a novel strategy to foster greater efficiency and resilience in the manufacturing industry. Successful digital collaborative manufacturing platforms, such as GAIA-X, allow manufacturers to share their production capacity and facilitate consumers to access up-to-date resource availabilities transparently and affordably. Although there are efforts to establish an industry-standard digital infrastructure for collaborative manufacturing systems, there are research questions in this landscape such as making these systems more human-centric by exploiting Industry 5.0 technologies, allowing collaborators to jointly design the products and value chain, utilizing generative AI and machine learning technologies to advance the current cyber-physical systems to be more cognitive developing smart methods for efficient, fair and inclusive resource sharing. Hence, this special session aims to bring together practitioners and researchers in collaborative manufacturing systems and facilitate knowledge exchange for best practices and state-of-the-art research to answer these questions. Studies that discuss industry maturity levels for collaborative manufacturing adaptation, social economic, and business barriers along with proposed resolutions are also invited to submit a paper to the special session.

 Special Session 6: Zero Defects and Zero Waste strategies in Industrial Collaborative Networks  
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data driven solutions towards Zero Defects and Zero Waste (ZDZW) solutions apply digital technologies to eliminate product and process errors and resource waste. Developing these solutions requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders (e.g., AI engineers, data scientist, system integrators) in complex collaborative networks. Technologies like blockchain, data spaces, or Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) emerge as enablers to achieve effective collaborations in the digital domain.  
 This special session focuses on discussing and disseminating real cases under development in different research initiatives. The session will address specific challenges related to the integration (collaboration robotics, data space, standardisation, interoperability, untrustworthy environments, etc.) of new sensors and the application of artificial intelligence for the detection, identification, and quantification of production defects or resource waste on a real-time basis.  
 Some of the use cases covered include a) blockchain based architectures for Inspection as a Service (IaaS) enabling the data sharing between participants to be performed in a decentralised, transparent, and secure cloud manufacturing system, building trust between them, b) cloud native robotics to enable safe, dynamic, and real-time decision-making for a collaborative working environment between humans and robots and c) Use of Data Spaces for zero waste solutions in the time critical bio-production section.

 Cognitive Architectures and Multi-agent Social Simulation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.7-21 

 As we know, a cognitive architecture is a domain-generic computational cognitive model that may be used for a broad analysis of cognition and behavior. Cognitive architectures embody theories of cognition in computer algorithms and programs. Social simulation with multi-agent systems can benefit from incorporating cognitive architectures, as they provide a realistic basis for modeling individual agents (as argued in Sun 2001). In this survey, an example cognitive architecture will be given, and its application to social simulation will be sketched.

 The rapid growth in technology has made the computer a vital tool for a wide variety of applications. Software that aids the common user in performing routine computing chores have now become commonplace. With the Internet growing rapidly, numerous new sites are coming into existence each day. This necessarily means that a user has to spend more time and energy to search for a particular piece of information. The need of the day is to develop software that can act more like a human assistant understanding and learning a user’s behavior to emulate and aid him to carry out his task in a simpler and easier manner. Presented in this paper is one such architecture wherein agents inhabit the desktop, monitor user behavior and over a period of time learn to adapt and take over routine tasks. Embedded on the Microsoft Windows 2000 desktop, the agents in this architecture work co-operatively with one another to provide desktop management and intelligent web surfing support.

  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.33-44 

 We study on the Prisoner's Dilemma game on network to clarify the influence of the network structures on agent strategies, and vice versa. A model is proposed to treat an interaction between the agent strategies and the network formation process. In case of a fixed network, it is observed that the distribution as well as the propagation speed of an agent strategy depends on the network structure. In an experiment combining the agent evolution and the network formation, a novel network that has a few agents connected by all of other agents appears.   

 Addressing Constraint Failures in Agent Interaction Protocol    
   
 Conference Paper

  pp.45-59 

 The field of multi-agent systems shifts attention from one particular agent to a society of agents; hence the interactions between agents in the society become critical towards the achievement of their goals. We assume that the interactions are managed via an agent protocol which enables agents to coordinate their actions in order to handle the dependencies that exist between their activities. An agent’s failure to comply with the constraints attached within the protocol might cause a brittle protocol to fail. To address this problem, a constraint relaxation approach is applied using a distributed protocol language called the Lightweight Coordination Calculus (LCC). This paper describes the design and implementation of a constraint relaxation module to be integrated within the LCC framework. The working of this module is later illustrated using a scenario involving the ordering and configuration of a computer between the customer and vendor agents.

 Rational agents must be aware of their success and failure to truly assess their own progress towards their intended goals. In this study we describe a detailed investigation of how current BDI agents monitor their successes and failures during their reasoning cycle. Our analysis indicates that the existing architectures are inadequate to specifically detect failures in their own behaviors. This makes them unaware of the reality of the environment in which they are operating. We propose an extended BDI-like architecture to address these problems. We extend the current reasoning cycle by reformulating the execution of actions and plans, and introducing additional rules to detect failures. The resulting reformulation can be applied to existing systems such as JACK, JAM, etc. As a case study we extended JASON to implement the extended BDI architecture. Yes Yes

 Diverse Applications of an Automated Argument System Based on the Logic of Multiple-Valued Argumentation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jan 1970 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 
  pp.88-102 

 A Logic of Multiple-valued Argumentation (LMA) was formalized by Takahashi and Sawamura on an expressive knowledge representation language, Extended Annotated Logic Programming (EALP). LMA allows agents to construct arguments under uncertain knowledge and to argue with other agents on uncertain issues in the open networked heterogeneous environment. In this paper, we demonstrate its expressiveness and applicability through implementing it in a networked environment and applying it to diverse uncertain domains in which decision-making is sought in an argumentative way. We then show that it is the diversity of truth values in LMA that allows for an extensive applicability of it.

 Multi-agent system(MAS) has more advantages because the agents can collaborate to complete complex tasks. However, the multi-agent interactions are more complex and even uncontrolled and it is difficult to resolve the multi-agent collaborations. This paper focuses on the interaction protocol in MAS. Firstly the interaction ontology library including role ontology, action ontology and message ontology is introduced into the semantic interactions. Then the representation of interaction protocol is presented which describes an interaction protocol as process description and decision-making rules. Then we propose a three-layer agent architecture that contains knowledge layer, collaboration control layer and communication layer. We embed a protocol interpreter and loader into the collaboration control layer to deal with the interactions between agents. Finally dynamic interaction protocol load in MAS are discussed, which load the interaction protocol from protocol library conveniently and the code will be generated automatically. To the end we give an experiment to verify our resolution.   

 Towards a Component-Based Architecture for TeleAgents

 The component-based design of software systems has long been recognised in the realm of software engineering as a method for building highly adaptable and maintainable software systems. This paper explores the principles behind software agent-orientated frameworks and the component-based design of software agents. The ideas and principles discussed are then used in the introduction of our AgentAssembly framework and its application to the component-based construction of TeleAgents.   

 Development of a Lightweight Middleware Technologies Supporting Mobile Agents    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2009 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 
  pp.128-138 

 The mobile agent technology is considered to be very useful for ubiquitous environments. But in order to apply the mobile agent concept to ubiquitous devices, the mobile agent platform should be lightweight because the devices in ubiquitous environments have very limited computing resources. Normally, the ubiquitous devices have J2ME CLDC environments. But this environment has very limited functionality and does not support reflection, dynamic class loading, object serialization, and so on. Therefore it is very hard to develop the mobile agent platform over the standard J2ME CLDC environments. We have developed the lightweight mobile agent platform, called mMAP, for PDAs with J2ME CDC and have developed the proxy platform, called SAP, for the mobile phone with J2ME CLDC/MIDP. SAP manages the proxy agent, called shadow agent, which is created for each mobile agent in the mMAP. The cooperation between the two platforms allows us to control the mobile agents through the mobile phone.   

 The Roles of Active Perception in Intelligent Agent Systems    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.139-152 

 This paper discusses the need to incorporate the notion of active perception in intelligent agent systems. There are two justifications for this proposition. First, we believe perception should receive more attention and some special treatment. Perception is the most direct and effective way to update an agent’s beliefs about the status of its environment. In theory, an overwhelming portion of an agent’s decisions about its next course of action, or next actions, in either the reactive or deliberative model should be heavily influenced by what is happening in the environment – this is one of the important characteristics that differentiates agents from the traditional software design paradigm. An agent’s internal activities, such as deliberation and means-end analysis to a large extent, are also driven by what have been sensed. The second justification is that active perception plays an imperative role in situation awareness. Active perception is an important capability that directs an agent’s limited attention to the relevant aspects of the environment in an proactive manner.   

 Fairness in Cooperating Multi-agent Systems – Using Profit Sharing as an Example    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.153-162 

 Distributing profit in a coalition of multiple cooperating agents [3] is an important issue in both multi-agent and economics society. Proposed in 1953, Shapley value scheme with its elegant axiomatic derivation is essential to solution concepts for profit sharing. However, Shapley value scheme did not cover fairness issues. A new scheme of profit sharing with fairness awareness is proposed in this work. Axioms considering both fairness and efficiency issues are included in the new scheme. An algorithm is constructed for calculation of profit sharing under this new scheme. The existence of a solution existence and other properties of this algorithm are discussed.   

 Risk Strategies and Risk Strategy Equilibrium in Agent Interactions Modeled as Normal Repeated 2 ×2 Risk Games    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.163-177 

 Many multi-agent interactions, like auctions and negotiations, can be modeled as games. Game theory is a tool to analyze these multi-agent applications as games and to analyze how agents should interact in these applications, which helps design intelligent agents. In many of the existing solutions to these multi-agent applications, the concept of risk is used, but it is not formally defined in game theory. On the other hand, in many games, pure strategy Nash equilibrium does not exist, while mixed or behavioral strategy equilibria are not appropriate, as mixed or behavioral strategies are probabilistic in nature, and it is possible that a low utility results in particular (sub)games. Worse, mixed or behavioral strategies cannot properly model the autonomous nature of agents. Furthermore, trigger strategies for repeated games are based on punishment, which is sometimes not as good as making decisions based on experience. However, making decisions based on past experience is not represented in existing game theory concepts. To solve the problems, we introduce the concept of risk strategies in repeated 2 ×2 risk games. We find that players can get better payoffs by using risk strategy than using mixed or behavioral strategies in repeated 2 ×2 risk games. In addition, we find that a game without pure strategy Nash equilibrium can converge to a new type of equilibrium which we define as risk strategy equilibrium.   

 A Crowd Model for Emergency and Panic Situations: Structure, Characteristics and Behaviours    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.178-191 

 We describe a crowd model in emergency and panic situations. First, we describe the crowd structure of our model that comprises a combination of group-based and individual-based agents. This is followed by a description on the agent’s characteristics and its behaviours for emergency and panic situations. Detailed descriptions on agent’s behaviours including graphical illustrations and pseudo-scripts are also given. Finally, we summarize the paper and discuss the future work on the implementation of the crowd model for emergency and panic situations.   

 Learning the Structure of Utility Graphs Used in Multi-issue Negotiation through Collaborative Filtering    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2009 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 

 Graphical utility models represent powerful formalisms for modeling complex agent decisions involving multiple issues [2]. In the context of negotiation, it has been shown [10] that using utility graphs enables reaching Pareto-efficient agreements with a limited number of negotiation steps, even for high-dimensional negotiations involving complex complementarity/ substitutability dependencies between multiple issues. This paper considerably extends the results of [10], by proposing a method for constructing the utility graphs of buyers automatically, based on previous negotiation data. Our method is based on techniques inspired from item-based collaborative filtering, used in online recommendation algorithms. Experimental results show that our approach is able to retrieve the structure of utility graphs online, with a high degree of accuracy, even for highly non-linear settings and even if a relatively small amount of data about concluded negotiations is available.   

 ARTISTE: Agent Organization Management System for Multi-Agent Systems    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.207-221 

 An organizational information management system for multi-agent systems (MASs) on the Internet, called ARTISTE, is proposed. For an MAS to solve problems effectively, it is important to organize agents appropriately. Organizing agents adaptively on the Internet, however, is not easy, because the status of the Internet changes dynamically in a short time and no one can have a complete view of the whole network. The aims of ARTISTE are to form an agent organization in accordance with the current Internet and its problem-solving context and to provide organizational information for target MASs. ARTISTE operates as an independent system with respect to any MAS. To organize agents, ARTISTE collects information about agents’ abilities and statuses network information such as topologies, and a problem-dependent requirement from a target MAS. ARTISTE is designed as an MAS and it can collect the information about the network and the target MAS from multiple observation points. Furthermore, ARTISTE agents exchange their own local information in order to create a more global view of the network and the distribution of the agents. A prototype implementation of ARTISTE achieved sufficient performance to support deployment in the actual Internet environment.

  pp.222-230 

 In sensor networks, each sensor has very limited capability in battery life and processing power. This problem can be solved by employing a middleware system which can reduce the load of each sensor to expend the each sensor’s battery life and provide the proper control of the sensed data. In this paper, we propose a middleware model using multi-agent for small-area sensor networks. This model is focused on three functions such as data aggregation, network topology management, and sensor’s state control. With this model, the sensors need not to care of the data routing and the applications need not to care how the sensors are connected each other and how the necessary sensing data can be obtained. With this model, more flexible sensor based system can be constructed easily.

 In ubiquitous environment, each agent tires to aware the context. Usually, the context which agent tries to recognize, consists of different information. Even if several agents are in the same environment, each agent’s contexts are different. As every agent has different intention in the process of interaction with the environment, the view of each agent to the environment is different from others’ view. This difference in awareness of each agent can cause the conflict. As every agent behaves based on its own context, an agent’s action can interrupt other agent’s action. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for conflict management where several agents exist with different views for one situation. In this solution, two middleware agents are employed. One is the conflict manager which overlooks the whole situation and decides whether the requests of agents lead to the collision with existing requests. The other is the scheduler which selects which request should be performed according to the priority. With these middleware agents, the conflict can be effectively resolved by maximizing the usage of resources and minimizing the cancellation of requests.   

 Multi-auction Approach for Solving Task Allocation Problem

 Request for Proposal (RFP) problem is a type of task allocation problem where task managers need to recruit service provider agents to handle complex tasks composed of multiple sub-tasks, with the objective being to assign each sub-task to a capable agent while keeping the cost as low as possible. Most existing approaches either involve centralized algorithms or require each agent's cost for doing each sub-task to be known publicly beforehand, or attempt to force the agents to disclose such information by means of truth-telling mechanism, which is not practical in many problems where such information is sensitive and private. In this paper, we present an efficient multi-auction based mechanism that can produce near-optimal solutions without violating the privacy of the participating agents. By including an extra verification step after each bid, we can guarantee convergence to a solution while achieving optimal results in over 97% of the times in a series of experiment.

 Companion Modeling is a methodology used to facilitate adaptive management of renewable resources by their users. It is using role-playing games (RPG) and multiagent simulations to validate initial models representing the functioning of complex systems to be managed. In this research, we propose a novel agent model construction methodology in which classification learning is applied to the RPG log data in Companion Modeling. This methodology enables a systematic model construction that handles multi-parameters, independent of the modelers’ ability. There are three problems in applying classification learning to the RPG log data: 1) It is difficult to gather enough data for the number of features because the cost of gathering data is high. 2) Noise data can affect the learning results because the amount of data may be insufficient. 3) The learning results should be explained as a human decision making model and should be recognized by the expert as reflecting reality. We realized an agent model construction system using the following two approaches: 1) Using a feature selection method, the feature subset that has the best prediction accuracy is identified. In this process, the important features chosen by the expert are always included. 2) The expert eliminates irrelevant features from the learning results after evaluating the learning model through a visualization of the results. Finally, using the RPG log data from a Companion Modeling case study on rice production in northeastern Thailand, we confirm the capability of this methodology.   

 Modeling a MultiAgent Mobile Robotics Test Bed Using a Biologically Inspired Artificial Immune System    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2009 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 
  pp.270-283 

 The biological immune system is a complex, adaptive, pattern-recognition system that defends the body from foreign pathogens. The system uses learning, memory, and associative retrieval to solve recognition issues and classification of tasks. In particular, it learns to recognize relevant problems, remember those encountered in the past, and uses combinations to construct problem detectors efficiently. This paper explores an application of an adaptive learning mechanism for robots based on the natural immune system, using two algorithms, viz., the behavior arbitration mechanism and the clonal selection algorithm to demonstrate the innate and adaptive immune response respectively. The work highlights the innate and adaptive characteristics of the immune system, wherein a robot learns to detect vulnerable areas of a track and adapts to the required speed over such portions. A detailed study of the artificial immune metaphor is carried out and mapped onto the robot world. The robotics test bed comprised two Lego robots deployed simultaneously on two predefined near concentric tracks with the outer robot capable of helping the inner one when it misaligns. The inner robot raises an SOS signal on misalignment. The outer robot aids the inner robot to regain it alignment exhibiting the innate immunity. The adaptive system within the inner robot learns to tackle the problem in future using Clonal Selection mechanism.

 The limited description, discovery and integration mechanisms of current web service-based systems have many setbacks that hinder the extension and incorporation of dynamic capabilities into these systems. In this paper we present a novel software architecture called intelligent aspect-oriented web services (IAOWS) which addresses these problems and further improves on this technology by allowing for dynamic look-up and integration. IAOWS use a combination of Aspect-Oriented Multi-Agents and aspectual service descriptors for aspect-oriented web services to cater for more complete and thorough descriptions of services, thus supporting better dynamic discovery of both services and components, and their seamless integration and consumption by clients. We describe our IAOWS architecture and an initial implementation using .NET web services technology to engineer and deploy the Multi-Agents and capture the rich cross-cutting aspects together with their behavior and interaction within our highly distributed system.

 This paper extends XMDR[19] into G-XMDR (Global-Extended Metadata Registry) to ensure the interoperability of data, and to describe multi agent system using G-XMDR. The proposal G-XMDR will be solved the problem of data heterogeneity and inconsistency in sharing and exchanging each local data in virtual pervasive computing environments. Data heterogeneity is generated by different definition or mismatched expression of the same meaning data. Therefore, we define and design G-XMDR based on XMDR(ISO/IEC 11179) specification to interoperate various each local data in pervasive computing. We also describe our synchronizing multi agent system, which uses G-XMDR to solve data heterogeneity for data interoperability through synchronizing data. It provides more efficient agent through reducing errors that happened on synchronizing requests and adding new pervasive computing environments with their own each local data.

 Time plays a crucial role in describing dynamic domain and resources on the Web. Most of current ontology languages, without notion of time or change, can only describe domain knowledge in a static sense. In order to bring structure to time-varying information, we propose an interval-based knowledge model (IKM), which is composed of a temporal knowledge schema, temporal integrity constraints and an interpretation structure. In the IKM, a group of expressive temporal constructs are provided to capture the temporal features of concepts, attributes and relationships; a group of rules are defined to enrich expressivity of the model; formal meaning is given to the model via an interpretation with model-theoretical semantics. A high-level query language is defined on the model, too.   

 A Petri-Net-Based Modeling Framework for Automated Negotiation Protocols in Electronic Commerce

 A negotiation protocol is a specification of the rules that govern deliberation among negotiation agents. To model negotiation protocols formally is an important task in the designing of automated negotiation systems for electronic commerce. Lots of work has been done for negotiation modeling, but there still lacks a formalism for negotiation protocols of time-constrained multi-issue negotiation, which can be widely applied in electronic commerce. This paper proposes a modeling framework for time constrained multi-issue negotiation protocol. An extended Colored Petri Net model is proposed and used to represent the modeling framework formally. To illustrate the applicability of the extended Colored Petri Net model, an auction protocol with fixed number of bidders are modeled and the model’s characteristics are verified using the Petri Net verification tool HPSim.

 Longitudinal and persistent electronic medical record system is called EHR (Electronic Health Record) system. Many hospitals are trying to install EMR (Electronic Medical Record) system with slogan of paperless, chartless, filmless and slipless hospital. We propose an agent interaction messaging model to express the meaning of messages of ACL (Agent Communication Language) between agents that play key roles for Electronic Health Record System. Functional entities are divided according to tasks and implemented as collaborating agents.

 Problems of having different vocabularies pointed at the same terminology for health care parties are today’s issue. Communication problem of this kind in health information system around the globe are still without answers. By fast growing Intelligent Agent technology in the medical field, this issue becomes large enough to halt the progress. Agents for valid communication need to have same understanding over the terminology. Misunderstanding about meaning of a specific terminology by human is as same as misunderstandings of intelligent agents about meaning of a term-which concludes a fault communication-with the difference that agents are connected to each other and can exchange though at no time. The problem is where an agent can report for a valid knowledge base and correct meaning of a term. This paper is addressing this issue by presenting a Medical Vocabulary Interpreter as an Agent (We assume it to be a well known software, waiting to answer questions about original meaning of a terminology and ready to reply-first in first out service) to share a vast amount of complex information pointing to the same root.   

 Multi-agent Cooperation: A Description Logic View

 In this paper we propose dynamic description logic for formalizing multi-agent cooperation process with a clearly defined syntax and semantics. By combining the features of knowledge representation and reasoning of description logic and action theory for multi-agent interaction, our logic is effective and significant both for static and dynamic environment. On the static side, we employ description logic for the representation and reasoning of beliefs and goals. On the dynamic side, we adopt the object-oriented method to describe actions. The description of each action is composed of models, preconditions and effects. It can reflect the real changes of the world and is very suitable for belief revision and action planning. Based on our logic, we investigate how to form joint goal for multi-agent cooperation. In particular, we propose an effective dynamic planning algorithm for scheduling sub goals, which is greatly crucial for coordinating multi-agent behaviors.   

 Enhancing Bidding Strategies in CDAs by Adaptive Judgement of Price Acceptability

 Continuous Double Auctions (CDAs) and agent technology provide great opportunities for market institutions to carry out real-world trading quickly and conveniently. There are several bidding strategies in the literature for agents in CDAs to employ, which achieve good performance. However, almost all of these strategies do not judge whether a price is acceptable before they calculate their own asks or bids. Experiment results have demonstrated that the judgement of price acceptability can enhance the performance of agents. In order to enable agents to adopt the judgement of price acceptability in dynamic CDA markets, we propose an adaptive mechanism. The core of the adaptive mechanism is eagerness, which enables agents to explore the realtime supply and demand relationship and adjust the thresholds of price acceptability accordingly. Experiment results show that agents adopting the adaptive mechanism remarkably outperform the agents without the mechanism.   

 Dealing with Objectives in a Constraint-Based Extension to AgentSpeak(L)

  pp.395-409 

 Incorporating constraints into a reactive BDI agent programming language can lead to better expressive capabilities as well as more efficient computation (in some instances). More interestingly, the use of constraint-based representations can make it possible to deal with explicit agent objectives (as distinct from agent goals) that express the things that an agent may seek to optimize at any given point in time. In this paper we extend the preliminary work of Ooi et.al [1] in augmenting the popular BDI language AgentSpeak(L)[4] with constraint-handling capabilities. We present a slightly modified version of their proposal, in the form of the language CAS (Constraint AgentSpeak). We then extend CAS to form the language CASO (Constraint AgentSpeak with Objectives) to incorporate explicit objectives (represented as objective functions) and present techniques for performing option selection (selecting the best plan to use to deal with the current event) as well as intention selection. In both cases, we present parametric look-ahead techniques, i.e., techniques where the extent of look-ahead style deliberation can be adjusted.

 Research on ontology is becoming increasingly widespread in the com-puter science community, and its importance is being recognized in a multiplicity of research fields and application areas, including knowledge engineering, database design and integration, information retrieval and extraction. We shall use the generic term “in-formation systems”, in its broadest sense, to collectively refer to these application per-spectives. We argue in this paper that so-called ontologies present their own methodo-logical and architectural peculiarities: on the methodological side, their main peculiar-ity is the adoption of a highly interdisciplinary approach, while on the architectural side the most interesting aspect is the centrality of the role they can play in an infor-mation system, leading to the perspective of ontology-driven information systems.

 Rice varieties and seed management involve a complex system dealing with various problems such as variety adoption, agro-biodiversity conservation, and quality seed supply. A participatory modeling experiment on rainfed lowland rice variety and seed management in lower northeast Thailand has been launched to better understand the system and its problems. Conceptual modeling was done through inter-institutional research team meetings, stakeholder analysis, surveying of stratified randomly sampled farmers and seed supply agents in Ubon Ratchathani Province, and by conceiving and using role-playing games (RPGs) with stakeholders. The system to be analyzed was divided into three subsystems, i.e. farmers' decision making regarding the choice of rice varieties, farmers' management of rice seeds, and the seed supply sub-system. A first RPG focusing on the first two subsystems was used with 25 farmers in two different gaming sessions. Observations and findings from the RPG helped to validate and to improve the conceptual model prepared by the research team. It also builds a shared understanding of farmers' rice varieties and seed management. Limited access to information about varieties and seeds, the need for early maturing varieties, and the scarcity of quality seeds were identified as current constraints of the system. A second RPG representing the seed supply subsystem is being conceived. Later on, a multi-agent system model of the whole system will also be developed and used to simulate scenarios identified by stakeholders and to discuss their results to facilitate collective learning and improvement of the current situation.

In this paper, we describe our recent work applying Aspect-Oriented Component Engineering (AOCE) to develop more adaptable, higher quality and more reusable software components for web services. We give examples on how AOCE can be used to design and implement Web Service- based systems, including aspect-oriented enhancements to the Web Services Description Language and the Universal Discovery, Description and Integration standards. We describe a prototype web services system we have implemented using AOCE to demonstrate and evaluate our technique.

 Intelligent Agents are being used for modelling simple rational behaviours in a wide range of distributed applications. In particular, multi-agent architectures based on the Belief-Desire- Intention model have been u sed successfully in situations where modelling of human reasoning and team behaviour are needed, such as simulating tactical decision-making in defence operations and command and control structures. Other applications include intelligent web applications, manufacturing control, telephone call centres, and air traffic management. The JACK Intelligent Agents™ framework by Agent Oriented Software brings the c oncept of intelligent agents into the mainstream of commercial software e ngineering and Java. JACK Intelligent Agents™ is a third generation agent framework, designed as a set of lightweight components with high performance and strong data typing. We present the design approach and major technical characteristics of JACK Intelligent Agents™, with a focus on some of the more recent developments - modular structuring elements called Capabilities and the team-based reasoning model called SimpleTeam. Two example applications, in decision support and defence simulation are described. Also, we discuss the benefits of the c omponent-based approach, both for the software engineer developing sophisticated distributed applications, and for the researcher exploring agent models and architectures.

 In the feature subset selection problem, a learning algorithm is faced with the problem of selecting a relevant subset of features upon which to focus its attention, while ignoring the rest. To a c hieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular training set, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training set interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach a n d s h o w a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a lter approach to feature subset selection. Signiicant improvement in accuracy is achieved for some datasets for the two families of induction algorithms used: decision trees and Naive-Bayes.

 Virtual sensors: Heterogeneous aggregation in pervasive networks

 Sanem Kabadayi

 Sensor networks are increasingly used to provide pervasive environments. These deployment environments entail embedded sensing devices that have limited pro- cessing, memory, and battery power. It is therefore essential to devise ecient ap- proaches that can collect low-level sensed data and transform it to a higher, more abstract measurement to relay to the user. This paper introduces the virtual sen- sors abstraction that enables an application developer to create software sensors that can apply user-specified functions on dierent types of data to provide a higher-level measurement that is not an intrinsic measurement provided by the physical sensors in the network. We evaluate our implementation of the virtual sensors model in two diverse example domains.

 Addressing Constraint Failures in Distributed Dialogue Protocols    
   
 Thesis    
 Jan 2003 

 Nardine Osman 
    
 Early agent communication languages lacked the means to coordinate the interaction between agents. The importance of coordination was better appreciated when open systems became in favor. Some solutions have been proposed; however, these normally rely on centralized gatekeepers. Distributed Dialogues, on the other hand, provide both communication and coordination protocols for multi-agent systems. They do that without the need to re-program agents every time they need to adapt to a new dialogue system and without the need for centralized gatekeepers for coordination. However, these dialogue protocols still aren’t tolerant to failure. When an agent does not respond appropriately, the dialogue simply stops. This usually happens when constraints are broken. This dissertation addresses these kinds of failure by offering ‘induced backtracking’ to explore other parts of the dialogue. It also proposes a negotiation protocol that could be used when some failed constraints are better dealt with by negotiation.

 Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation    
   
 Book    
 Jan 2005

 This book explores the intersection between cognitive sciences and social sciences. In particular, it explores the intersection between individual cognitive modeling and modeling of multi-agent interaction (social stimulation). The two contributing fields - individual cognitive modeling (especially cognitive architectures) and modeling of multi-agent interaction (including social simulation and, to some extent, multi-agent systems) - have seen phenomenal growth in recent years. However, the interaction of these two fields has not been sufficiently developed. We believe that the interaction of the two may be more significant than either alone. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.

 Trustworthy Data Sharing in Collaborative Pervasive Computing Environments    
   
 Article    
 Jan 2005 

 Stephen S. Yau 
    
 Collaborative Pervasive Computing Applications (COPCAs) can greatly improve the investigative capabilities and productivity of scientists and engineers. Users of COPCAs usually form groups to collaboratively perform their tasks using various computing devices, including desktop computers, pocket PCs, and/or smart phones, over Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET), LAN, and the Internet. These users usually share various types of data, including research ideas (documents), experimental and statistical data (numerical data, graphics, stream audio/video). A very important issue for sharing data in Collaborative Pervasive Computing Environments (COPCEs) is trustworthiness. To support trustworthy data sharing among groups of users of COPCAs, secure group communication, trustworthy shared data discovery, flexible access control mechanisms, effective data replication, data quality assurance mechanisms, and intrusion detection mechanisms are needed. In this chapter, the challenges, current state-of-the-art, and future research directions for trustworthy data sharing in COPCEs are presented. In particular, discussions will be focused on research issues and future research directions for trustworthy shared data discovery and flexible access control in service-based COPCAs.

 Immune system has powerful abilities such as memory, recognition and learning to respond to invaded antigens, and is expected to be applied to many industrial applications as well as neural networks. This paper proposes an algorithm imitating the immune system that is based on the somatic theory and the network hypothesis in order to make a plan for manufacturing systems. The former theory illustrates that somatic recombination and mutation contributes to increasing of the diversity of antibody. The others illustrates that mutual recognition network among the antibodies contributes to control of proliferation of clones. This paper shows that the proposed algorithm based on these theories is capable of searching for a global solution not but local solutions through a resource allocation problem.

 Mobile Agent Technology Enabling The Virtual Enterprise: A Pattern for Database Query    
   
 Article    

 Todd Papaioannou 
  John Edwards 
    
 The flexible integration of a range of disparate IT applications is a key requirement for today's global enterprises. The virtual enterprise, formed by a collection of collaborating companies for short term, high return, one off projects provides perhaps the most extreme example of this need. It is unlikely that any collaborators in a virtual enterprise will have similar networks or software, but the requirement exists for them to inter-operate. This paper proposes the notion that Mobile Agent Technology can be a significant aid to enterprise agility, particularly where distribution of information is a feature, as in virtual enterprises. The implications of using Java and its facilities for database connectivity (JDBC) together with mobile agent environments are discussed before a model to fulfil the requirements of the manufacturing Sales/Order process is proposed. The model used in the process has been produced with data collected from an industrial case study. The subsequent decomposition of the Agent types involved reveals an abstract pattern for database query using agent technology. Finally, the tools required by an enterprise wishing to utilise agent technology are discussed.

 To share and standardize information, especially in the database environments, MDR (Metadata Registry) can be used to integrate various heterogeneous databases within a particular domain. But due to the discrepancies of data element representation between organizations, global information integration is not so easy. And users who are searching integrated information on the Web have limitation to obtain schema information for the underlying source databases. To solve those problems, in this paper, we present a 3-layered Information Integration System (LI2S) based on MDRs and Ontology. The purpose of proposed architecture is to define information integration model, which combine both of the nature of MDRs standard specification and functionality of ontology for the concept and relation. Adopting agent technology to the proposed model plays a key role to support the hierarchical and independent information integration architecture. Ontology is used as for a role of semantic network from which it extracts concept from the user query and the establishment of relationship between MDRs for the data element. (MDR and Knowledge Base are used as for the solution of discrepancies of data element representation between MDRs. Based on this architectural concept, LI2S was designed and implemented.

 The ability to describe, locate, choose, and interact with services is an integral part of pervasive computing. Compared to previous computing environments, pervasive computing environments are more dynamic and transient while services and clients in these environments are diverse in type and function. In order to effectively facilitate communication and computation in these environments, protocols must be able to these characteristics. This work concentrates on our approach to two of the four components of service discovery, service description and dissemination. We introduce and compare the performance of our schemes to that of existing industrial and research approaches.

 This study provides an empirical evaluation of the effects of an enhanced predictive display concept for air traffic control. The predictive display informed the controller of the targeted altitude or heading of aircraft in a transitionary state The information provided simulated that which could be produced by a datalink from the aircraft's flight management system in a future air traffic system operation. The pilots in the simulation operated under self-separation rules and did not request clearances for altered flight plans. Use of the predictive display resulted in improvements in some air traffic control performance and situation awareness measures. Based on the results of the study, we recommend making improvements to the predictive display to better integrate it with the controller's radar display.

 Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a merger of two declarative paradigms: constraint solving and logic programming. Although a relatively new field, CLP has progressed in several quite different directions. In particular, the early fundamental concepts have been adapted to better serve in different areas of applications. In this survey of CLP, a primary goal is to give a systematic description of the major trends in terms of common fundamental concepts. The three main parts cover the theory, implementation issues, and programming for applications.

 This short paper outlines research that the Universities of Arizona and New Mexico have initiated in distributed robotics. A basic hypothesis of this research is that intrinsically efficient discrete event abstractions of soft computing paradigms, including neurons and fuzzy rule controllers, will enable cooperative multi-robot systems to overcome severe limitations on on- board processing and communications networking. Specifically, we seek to implement fast reacting agent architectures capable of identificatio n and neutralizations of non-self invaders. Implications in general for the tradeoffs between local computation, communication and ability to cooperatively self-organize are discussed. 1

 Internet agents are expected to accomplish their tasks despite heterogeneity; agents of different designs and of varying skills and domain knowledge need to interact successfully through knowledge and information exchange and effective coordination. We identify two distinct and separate problems that Internet agents are faced in an open and dynamic environment: knowledge sharing and coordination.

 Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a novel evolutionary paradigm inspired by the biological aspects of the immune system. The human immune system has motivated scientists and engineers for finding powerful information processing algorithms that has solved complex engineering tasks. This paper discusses two concepts. (a) The behavioral management of artificial intelligence (AI) namely the intelligent multi agent systems, (b) The evolutionary computation called the artificial immune system that imitates the biological theory called the immune system. The outcome of this research is an Artificial Immune System based Intelligent Multi Agent Model named AISIMAM that solves agent-based applications. The model is applied to a mine detection and diffusion problem and the results prove that AISIMAM has solved the problem successfully.

 Specification and verification of agent interactions using social integrity constraints

 Abstract In this paper we propose a logic-based social approach to the specification and verification of agent interaction. We firstly introduce integrity constraints about social acts (called Social Integrity Constraints) as a formalism to express interaction protocols and to give a social semantics to the behavior of agents, focusing on communicative acts. Then, we discuss several possible kinds of verification of agent interaction, and we show how social integrity constraints can be used to verify some properties in this respect. We focus our attention on static verification of compliance of agent specifications to interaction protocols, and on run-time verification, based on agents'observable behavior. We adopt as a running example the NetBill security transaction protocol for the selling and delivery of information goods.

 Bilateral Multi-Issue Contract Negotiation for Task Redistribution Using a Mediation Service    
   
 Article    
 Jan 2004 

 Raymund Lin 
    
 Research areas related to bilateral multi-issue negotiation problems include dealing with two-sided uncertainty, handling inter-dependent issues and determining rational negotiation strategies. Using a task-redistribution scenario, this study presents a mediation technique that can overcome most of these dif- ficulties. Agents in this mediation process can identify win-win solutions given two-sided uncertainty and inter-dependent issues. Furthermore, the negotiation strategy applied by agents is shown to be in game-theoretic equilibrium. Since no Prisoner's Dilemma is presented in the mediation game, the proposed mediation mechanism is ideal for mediating one-off negotiations.

 Teacher perspectives of school-based assessment in a secondary school in Kuala Lumpur

  School-based assessment is a new policy venture in the highly centralised education system of Malaysia. One area that has been subjected to this change initiative is the Oral English Assessment (OEA). A qualitative study was conducted to explore teacher perspectives of the implementation of school-based OEA among the Form 1 (Year 7) students in a secondary school. Semi-structured interviews were ... [Show full abstract]  conducted on two English Language teachers and their oral English assessment sessions were observed. Data were coded, clustered, and categorized into themes. Analysis indicated that both teachers generally agreed that school-based assessment is the way forward in assessment provided the fundamentals are in place. Issues such as grading guidelines and implementation procedures must be ironed out before successful implementation can happen. Cross-case analysis revealed three major themes: insufficient guidelines on the implementation process, lack of teachers’ knowledge base, and lack of external monitoring of school-based OEA. The inherent implication of the themes is that greater attention is required in the implementation of educational policies with effective alignment of the relevant tools.

  Intelligent agents configure a new generation of virtual entities that perform various autonomous tasks on behalf of others, namely the humans. On the other hand, the information society requires the development of new and more intelligent methods, tools and theories to analyse, define, model and specify agent-based systems. It is under this presupposition that in this work are introduced a ... [Show full abstract]  pre-argumentative reasoning scheme, which need to be able to take into account, in a negotiation, factors such as temporality, priority, delegation, gratitude and agreement, enabling the agents to react and pro-act accordingly. This argument-based negotiation among agents has much to gain from the use of Extended Logic Programming and Incomplete Information, in terms of the argument's evaluation. Indeed, it is based on this substratum that are presented the bases for a pre-contract negotiation via argumentation, where pre-contract negotiation will be defined as a protocol which, once enforced, will allow the exchange of messages containing proposals, counter-proposals, critiques, justifications or even explanations. The terms of a negotiation are also set, adjusting the contract according to the agent's knowledge base. In fact, an important contribution of this work relies on the presentation of the basic definitions and the general model of pre-contract-based negotiations via argumentation.

  This article describes an intelligent, integrated, web-based school for tutoring expansion and factoring of algebraic expressions. It provides full support for the management of the usual teaching tasks in a traditional school: Student and teacher registration, creation and management of classes and test papers, individualized assignment of exercises, intelligent step by step guidance in solving ... [Show full abstract]  exercises, student interaction recording, skill mastery statistics and student assessment. The intelligence of the system lies in its Algebra Tutor, a model-tracing tutor developed within the MATHESIS project, that teaches a breadth of 16 top-level math skills (algebraic operations): monomial multiplication, division and power, monomial-polynomial and polynomial-polynomial multiplication, parentheses elimination, collect like terms, identities (square of sum and difference, product of sum by difference, cube of sum and difference), factoring (common factor, term grouping, identities, quadratic form). These skills are further decomposed in simpler ones giving a deep domain expertise model of 104 primitive skills. The tutor has two novel features: a) it exhibits intelligent task recognition by identifying all skills present in any expression through intelligent parsing, and b) for each identified skill, the tutor traces all the sub-skills, a feature we call deep model tracing. Furthermore, based on these features, the tutor achieves broad knowledge monitoring by recording student performance for all skills present in any expression. Forty teachers who evaluated the system in a 3-hours workshop appreciated the fine-grained step-by-step guidance of the student, the equally fine grained student model created by the tutor and its ability to tutor any exercise that contains the aforementioned math skills. The system was also used in a real junior high school classroom with 20 students for three months. Evaluation of the students’ performance in the domain of factoring gave positive learning results.

  Over the past decade, Malaysia has enjoyed tremendous growth in its economy. This has brought about a population growth along with a great influx of foreign workforce to cities. This resulted in an increase in the amount of waste scheduled generated. Furthermore, scheduled waste management has long been a problem area for local authorities in Kuala Lumpur. Continued illegal dumping by waste ... [Show full abstract]  generators is being practiced at large scale due to lack of proper guidance and awareness. This report reviewed and discussed about service provided for scheduled waste management by an authority and international scenario of scheduled waste management. An expert system was developed to integrate scheduled waste management in Kuala Lumpur. The knowledge base was acquired through journals, books, magazines, annual report, and web sites. An object oriented expert system shell, Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition was used as the building tools for the prototype development. The overall development of this project has been carried out in several phases which are problem identification, problem statement and literature review, identification of domain experts, prototype development, knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation and prototype development. Scheduled waste expert system is developed based on five types of scheduled waste management which are label requirements, packaging requirements, impact of scheduled wastes, recycling of scheduled wastes, and recommendations. Besides, it contains several sub modules by which the user can obtain a comprehensive background of the domain. The output is to support effective integrated scheduled waste management.

 PROFES, the International Conference on on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement, is among the top recognized software development and process improvement conferences.  
 The objective of the International Conference on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement (PROFES) is to provide a premier forum for practitioners, researchers, and educators to present and discuss experiences, ideas, innovations, as well as concerns related to professional software process improvement motivated by product ans service quality needs.  
 PROFES conferences encourage the exchange of ideas that help explore, understand, and model phenomena in software engineering from the point of view of process-product relationships. Traditionally, PROFES provides topics, which are up-to-date, important, and interesting to both practitioners and researchers. To ensure that PROFES will retain its high standards and that it will keep focusing on the most relevant research issues, we are looking for original research on current trends in software engineering aspects addressing products and services. Further, PROFES asks for studies reporting about the application of respective methods or technologies in real settings.  
 PROFES cares about fundamental ethical values related to diversity, as gender, ethnicity, disability, religion, and similar personal traits. Diversity will be sought at different levels, remarkably including conference committees' composition.  
 PROFES conference organizers will set as highest priority to provide a welcoming, respectful and positive atmosphere to all attendees. Aggressive or offensive language will not be allowed in talks, questions or answers. Aggressive or offensive behaviour, including any type of harassing, will not be allowed in the event, being a justified reason for expulsion without any compensation. For more details on PROFES Conferences Code of Conduct see here   
 All PROFES conference committees as well as authors are obliged to follow and apply the Ethical Guideline as available at SPRINGER  (replacing journal by conference).  
 On this web site you can find information about the PROFES conference series as well as useful information for organizing a future PROFES conference.

 PROFES 2024  
   
 Welcome to the website of the 2024 edition of the International Conference on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement (PROFES).   
 PROFES is among the top recognized software development and process improvement conferences.The objective is to provide a premier forum for practitioners, researchers, and educators to present and discuss experiences, ideas, innovations, as well as concerns related to professional software process improvement motivated by product and service quality needs.  
 PROFES conferences encourage the exchange of ideas that help explore, understand, and model phenomena in software engineering from the point of view of process-product relationships. Traditionally, PROFES provides topics, which are up-to-date, important, and interesting to both practitioners and researchers. To ensure that PROFES will retain its high standards and that it will keep focusing on the most relevant research issues, we are looking for original research on current trends in software engineering aspects addressing products and services. Further, PROFES asks for studies reporting about the application of respective methods or technologies in real settings.  
 PROFES cares about fundamental ethical values related to diversity, as gender, ethnicity, disability, religion, and similar personal traits. Diversity will be sought at different levels, remarkably including conference committees’ composition.  
 PROFES conference organizers will set as highest priority to provide a welcoming, respectful and positive atmosphere to all attendees. Aggressive or offensive language will not be allowed in talks, questions or answers. Aggressive or offensive behaviour, including any type of harassing, will not be allowed in the event, being a justified reason for expulsion without any compensation. For more details on PROFES Conferences Code of Conduct see [link will soon be added].  
 All PROFES conference committees as well as authors are obliged to follow and apply the Ethical Guideline as available at SPRINGER.  
 Proceedings   
 The PROFES 2024 proceedings are available here:  
 Volume I: Research Papers (full and short) – https://link.springer.com/book/9783031783852

  Earth Friendly Computation: Applying Indigenous Data Lifecycles in Medical and Sovereign AI   
 Session Chairs: Keolu Fox, Krystal Tsosie, Kaja Wasik, Alec Calac, Alexander Ioannidis, Eric T. Dawson    
 The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) across fields - particularly with the advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) and the application of AI in human health - is generating vast quantities of data, consuming massive amounts of energy, and leaving behind significant environmental footprints. This growth poses a potential risk of exacerbating the climate crisis, which may, in turn, have major downstream impacts on global health.  
   
  This session will focus on the innovative integration of Indigenous data lifecycle models that respect the principles of data as a sacred entity and relation, with the growing field of medical AI, particularly in precision medicine and public health. We aim to foster a dialogue on how computational methods, rooted in Indigenous wisdom, can not only enhance the accuracy and fairness of AI in healthcare and other fields but also promote the conservation of environmental resources in computational practices.

 Session Chairs: Kathleen Barnes, Harris Bland, Francisco De La Vega, Todd L. Edwards, Keolu Fox, Alexander Ioannidis, Eimear Kenny, Rasika Mattias, Bogdan Pasaniuc, Jada Benn Torres, Digna R Velez Edwards,    
 This session seeks to advance computations methods and data science approaches to overcome disparities in precision medicine and public health by addressing racial, ethnic, and gender disparities across biomedical research, patient, provider, and health system levels, which are influenced by a mix of social, psychosocial, lifestyle, environmental, and biological factors. This year's emphasis will include intersectional research approaches that examine how various social identities and categories—like race, gender, class, sexuality, age, ability, and ethnicity—interact to shape individual experiences in healthcare and systemic inequalities. Emphasizing the role of 'Big Data' and the Electronic Health Record, the session will discuss challenges in computational approaches to intersectionality, particularly the capture and analysis of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and environmental risk factors. Strategies being developed to address these challenges include enhanced data collection through large population-based cohorts, multi-pronged approaches within large EHR populations, and advanced geocoding to assess environmental impacts in conjunction with clinical data. These efforts are essential to overcoming existing limitations in capturing complex and dynamic information such as transgender health issues, where traditional data collection methods fall short.

  Earth Friendly Computation: Applying Indigenous Data Lifecycles in Medical and Sovereign AI   
 Session Chairs: Keolu Fox, Krystal Tsosie, Kaja Wasik, Alec Calac, Alexander Ioannidis, Eric T. Dawson    
 The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) across fields - particularly with the advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) and the application of AI in human health - is generating vast quantities of data, consuming massive amounts of energy, and leaving behind significant environmental footprints. This growth poses a potential risk of exacerbating the climate crisis, which may, in turn, have major downstream impacts on global health.  
   
  This session will focus on the innovative integration of Indigenous data lifecycle models that respect the principles of data as a sacred entity and relation, with the growing field of medical AI, particularly in precision medicine and public health. We aim to foster a dialogue on how computational methods, rooted in Indigenous wisdom, can not only enhance the accuracy and fairness of AI in healthcare and other fields but also promote the conservation of environmental resources in computational practices.

 Session Chairs: Kathleen Barnes, Harris Bland, Francisco De La Vega, Todd L. Edwards, Keolu Fox, Alexander Ioannidis, Eimear Kenny, Rasika Mattias, Bogdan Pasaniuc, Jada Benn Torres, Digna R Velez Edwards,    
 This session seeks to advance computations methods and data science approaches to overcome disparities in precision medicine and public health by addressing racial, ethnic, and gender disparities across biomedical research, patient, provider, and health system levels, which are influenced by a mix of social, psychosocial, lifestyle, environmental, and biological factors. This year's emphasis will include intersectional research approaches that examine how various social identities and categories—like race, gender, class, sexuality, age, ability, and ethnicity—interact to shape individual experiences in healthcare and systemic inequalities. Emphasizing the role of 'Big Data' and the Electronic Health Record, the session will discuss challenges in computational approaches to intersectionality, particularly the capture and analysis of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and environmental risk factors. Strategies being developed to address these challenges include enhanced data collection through large population-based cohorts, multi-pronged approaches within large EHR populations, and advanced geocoding to assess environmental impacts in conjunction with clinical data. These efforts are essential to overcoming existing limitations in capturing complex and dynamic information such as transgender health issues, where traditional data collection methods fall short.

 Strategies and Challenges in Cloud-to-Cloud Migration Using Infrastructure as Code  
  Abstract   
 As the landscape of cloud computing continues to transform at a rapid pace, organizations seek to optimize operational costs, enhance system flexibility, and adjust to changing market demands. This paper reports a case study within a Finnish startup operating in self-service mobile payment systems. It provides a detailed analysis of migrating an application architecture from DigitalOcean to AWS (Amazon Web Services) using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), providing insights into the strategies, challenges, and outcomes of the process. The key findings suggest that while cloud migration involves considerable technical and operational challenges, the utilization of IaC (Infrastructure as Code) can significantly mitigate these obstacles, enhancing the speed, reliability, and security of the migration process. This research contributes to the limited literature on cloud-to-cloud migration, highlighting the effective use of IaC to facilitate transitions between cloud environments.

 Benchmarking Ongoing Development Output in Real-Life Software Projects  
  Abstract   
 In this case study we compare six different metrics and their suitability for productivity benchmarking on development output level. We use detailed data from four software industry projects performed by one company with overall 264 months of development and 1.1 million source lines of code. Code change, absolute growth and number of commits as well as invested effort are measured in consecutive 3-month periods. This allows us to observe alterations in productivity throughout the course of a project as well as inter-project comparisons. We find correlations between effort and the chosen output metrics as well as significant and explainable productivity differences between projects and project phases.   
 We also analyze whether the use of a clone detection algorithm can improve measurement by adjusting for copy & paste additions and renamed or moved code, and find that a small benefit exists. The redundancy-adjusted amount of code tokens added or modified seems to be the best metric among the selected, in particular in ongoing development where an already existing codebase is changed. Number of commits and absolute growth may complement the picture.

 A Multi-model Approach for Video Data Retrieval in Autonomous Vehicle Development  
  Abstract   
 Autonomous driving software generates enormous amounts of data every second, which software development organizations save for future analysis and testing in the form of logs. However, given the vast size of this data, locating specific scenarios within a collection of vehicle logs can be challenging. Writing the correct SQL queries to find these scenarios requires engineers to have a strong background in SQL and the specific databases in question, further complicating the search process. This paper presents and evaluates a pipeline that allows searching for specific scenarios in log collections using natural language descriptions instead of SQL. The generated descriptions were evaluated by engineers working with vehicle logs at the Zenseact on a scale from 1 to 5. Our approach achieved a mean score of 3.3, demonstrating the potential of using a multi-model architecture to improve the software development workflow. We also present an interface that can visualize the query process and visualize the results.

 AI-Based Automotive Test Case Generation: An Action Research Study on Integration of Generative AI into Test Automation Frameworks  
  Abstract   
 Generative AI is transforming software development, particularly in unit and regression testing. However, it’s rarely used in Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing due to hardware-specific environments. This paper examines integrating GitHub Copilot into automotive test automation frameworks, focusing on Volvo’s Test Automation Framework (TAF). It explores how Copilot can automate test case generation and compares AI-generated test cases with manually written ones in terms of reliability and robustness. Using an iterative action research methodology, the study evaluates the functional suitability of AI-generated test cases and the challenges of integration. Results show that in the first iteration, 23% of AI-generated test cases passed in Jenkins and received high functionality scores. In the second iteration, this increased to 36%. These findings highlight the potential of Generative AI to enhance HIL testing.

 AI Act High-Risk Requirements Readiness: Industrial Perspectives and Case Company Insights  
  Abstract   
 The AI Act’s (AIA) requirements for high-risk AI systems affect many aspects of modern software systems. Knowing which AIA-related technical challenges are relevant to different companies is essential to focus compliance-oriented research on the aspects that matter. We therefore conducted an interview study in collaboration with a case company that specializes in network video solutions within the security and surveillance industry. External experts enrich the study for a broader industry perspective. The goal was to analyze the case company’s readiness for the AIA’s high-risk requirements, based on methods and techniques already established prior to the legislation. Our results yielded a positive sentiment towards the regulation and the planning security that it brings, although a high workload was expected. We identified a solid foundation with well-established practices to build upon for the requirements on cybersecurity  , human oversight  , record-keeping  , and technical documentation  . However, we also report several open challenges, mainly connected to the requirement on data quality and governance  , followed by accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity  . The AIA specifically demands a post-market monitoring system  (Art 72) and the right to an explanation of individual decision-making  (Art 86). These two obligations were identified as especially challenging by the respondents. The result of this study is expected to steer future compliance-oriented work toward pressing challenges.

 Adopting Continuous Deployment in a Public Administration Project: An Industrial Case Study  
  Abstract   
 Continuous deployment is a significant trend in software development, yet its adoption and potential benefits within the public sector remain under-researched. This paper examines a case study of continuous deployment implementation in a public sector project undertaken by Solita, a software development company, for a client utilizing agile methodologies. The study provides a comprehensive overview of the motivations, benefits, and challenges encountered during continuous deployment adoption. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on continuous deployment by providing valuable insights into its application within the public sector context, offering practical recommendations for overcoming challenges and achieving successful implementation.

 An Automated Approach to Identify Source Code Files Affected by Architectural Technical Debt  
  Abstract   
 Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) is a persistent challenge in software development, often hindered by the absence of comprehensive architectural documentation. This research presents an automated approach to detect source code files indicative of ATD within a version control system. By analyzing code metrics, change history, and architectural smells, we identify files exhibiting signs of increasing complexity and maintenance effort. Our method was applied to the Apache Cassandra repository and validated through interviews with Ericsson developers. Results indicate a strong correlation between files with specific architectural smells, frequent modifications, and growing complexity, and the presence of ATD. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using source code analysis to systematically identify potential architectural issues, aiding developers in prioritizing refactoring efforts and improving software quality.

 On the Derivation of Quality Assurance Plans from Process Model Descriptions  
  Abstract   
 In domains such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices, high-quality software is key due to the critical nature of these applications and the low margin for failure. Ensuring the quality of software is essential to prevent potentially catastrophic outcomes. In this paper, we present an approach to derive quality assurance plans from well-defined process models. Utilizing the GQM model, we derive quality requirements and metrics based on a process example, which we realize in the process management tool Stages. Based on the exemplary realization, we simulate 100 projects to provide data used in a recommendation system that enriches the process model such that quality assurance plans including the metrics of interest can be generated from the process model. Our findings show that, given sufficient data is available, context-specific quality assurance plans can be generated and which particular steps have to be taken to realize the overall concept in the studied tool.

 Evaluating AI-Based Code Segmentation for ABAP Programs in an Industrial Use Case  
  Abstract   
 Many maintenance and evolution tasks in software engineering depend on the availability of logical code segments, especially AI- and data-driven approaches rely on segmented source code. In order to obtain logical segments a manual step is typically necessary. However, manual segmentation requires a basic understanding of the source code and delays the application of code analysis and refactoring tools. Automatic code segmentation provides an efficient way of extracting code snippets for further analysis to provide developers with actionable insights on software products and processes. Rule-based approaches rely on syntactic boundaries and lack the applicability of segmentation on multiple languages. In this article, we present our approach to learning logical code snippets using a BiLSTM neural network model. Driven by the requirements of an industrial use case, we train two models, one on the programming languages Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and Ruby, the other model is additionally trained on ABAP (“Advanced Business Application Programming”) snippets. To evaluate the performance of the models, we use real-world samples used in the SAP applications of our industry partner. We also compare the predictions of the model, with an accuracy >98%, to the results of human experts for segmenting ABAP code to evaluate whether AI-based code segmentation is perceived as effective by practitioners in our industrial use case. The study shows that only 42–51% of the predicted ABAP code snippets match the manual segmentation of the experts.

 Quantum Algorithms: Application and Feasibility  
  Abstract   
 In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of quantum algorithms for practical applications and categorize them into three types: green, yellow, and red. Green means the most feasible, while red means the least feasible. We select four quantum algorithms from the Algebraic and Number Theoretic fields, four from the Optimization field, six from the Machine Learning field, and four from the Oracular field to assess their feasibility. Our results show that some quantum algorithms can be applied to solve real-life problems in the near future, while other fields may take a long time to be practically applied. The feasibility assessment is obtained by considering whether there are requirements in the quantum algorithms that are hard to satisfy with current quantum technologies and predicting how much time it will require for those requirements to be satisfied in the future. We also provide a table summarizing the feasibility evaluation results of these quantum algorithms.

 Towards Solving Short-Term Generation Scheduling Problems on Quantum Computers  
  Abstract   
 Identifying possible use cases for quantum computers is important to evaluate the potential. This work-in-progress paper explores their potential for addressing the short-term generation scheduling (STGS) problem in hydropower plants. By working towards reformulating the STGS problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, we aim to leverage the capabilities of quantum computers to find optimal solutions. Initial results using piecewise linear approximation indicate promising outcomes. Further research will focus on the QUBO formulation, implementing the approach on quantum hardware, and assessing its performance.

 Generating and Evolving Real-Life Like Synthetic Data for e-Government Services Without Using Real-World Raw Data  
  Abstract   
 Testing of applications that use data from e-Government services as input requires test data that is real-life like but where the privacy of personal information is guaranteed. Many approaches exist for creating high-quality synthetic test data, but most of them need real-life raw data as input. Our research aims to develop and evaluate an approach for generating and evolving real-life like synthetic test data without using real-world raw data. The expected benefit of our research is to enable the creation and evolvement of meaningful and real-life like synthetic test data in situations where real-life raw data is not accessible due to privacy reasons.

 A Data-Driven Approach to Optimize Internal Software Quality and Customer Value Delivery  
  Abstract   
 The growing complexity, the ever-ending demands for new features, and the need to become faster to remain competitive force software development organizations to rethink their development and value delivery practices. While continuous delivery has become more popular, it still relies mainly on internal metrics, ad-hoc data, and expert opinions. As a result, software organizations stumble to find the balance between improving internal system quality and delivering external value. In fact, understanding and measuring customer value is on itself essential. In this PhD project, we aim for a better understanding of customer value and develop measurement instruments to be integrated with internal perspectives to drive proactive and continuous internal improvement while delivering relevant customer value.

 PRO-VE 2022 Explores Collaborative Networks in Digitalization and Society 5.0  

 Previous  Next    
 PRO-VE 2022 Explores Collaborative Networks in Digitalization and Society 5.0  
  PRO-VE 2022   – the 23rd IFIP/SOCOLNET Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises – was held from 19-21 September in Lisbon, Portugal and sponsored by IFIP Working Group 5.5.   
 Although initially planned as a hybrid event due to COVID uncertainties, PRO-VE 2022 ended up being run primarily as a physical event, attracting almost 90 participants. This provided great opportunities for face-to-face interactions, discussions, and exchange of experiences.   
 Three excellent keynotes enriched the program:   
 Cognitive Digital Twins: connecting the dots of Closed-Loop Lifecycle Management, by Dimitris Kyritsis, EPFL, Switzerland 
  Collaborative Potential of AI and Human Ingenuity in Co-creating Value in Society 5.0, by Massimiliano Luca Dragoni, European Commission 
  Is resilience enough? Collaborative Networks towards antifragility, by Salvatore Ammirato, University of Calabria, Italy 
  The event also included 55 technical papers, three panels and one hands-on tutorial.   
   
 The main theme of the conference was  Collaborative Networks in Digitalization and Society 5.0  . “Digitalization” represents a major ongoing transformation in industry and services where the adoption and integration of a large variety of novel information and communication technologies leads to more efficient, flexible, agile, and sustainable systems. Digitalization became one of the key aspects of Industry 4.0. Current trends towards  Industry 5.0  introduce a complementary view, targeting a sustainable, human-centric, and resilient industry. The notion of  Society 5.0  represents an even more comprehensive strategy on science, technology and innovation aiming a people-centric super-smart society.   
   
 As demonstrated in recent editions of PRO-VE, collaborative networks play a central role in these transformative processes. In fact, such ambitious goals can only be achieved through collaboration among multiple stakeholders, collaboration among intelligent / autonomous systems, and collaboration among human and systems.   
 PRO-VE 2022 was an active forum for sharing and discussing current developments and experiences regarding the role of collaborative networks in digitalization as well as identifying and discussing challenges ahead towards a collaborative Society 5.0.   
 The conference explored a wide array of topics, clustered along the following themes:   
 Digitalization in Collaborative Networks 
  Digital Twins in Industry 
  Digital Transformation Through the Lens of Sociotechnical Systems 
  Collaborative Business Models and Digitalization 
  Service Design for Society 5.0 and Industry 5.0 
  Architectures for Collaborative Enterprise Integration 
  AI Application in Collaborative Networks 
  Dynamic Interplay of Humans and AI in Collaborative Networks 
  AI and Digital Tools for Collaborative Healthcare Networks 5.0 
  Contribution of Digital Transformation to Sustainable Supply Chains 
  Agile and Responsive Supply Chains 
  Risk and Resilience in Collaborative Networks 
  A Path Forward Towards the Green D 
  Shaping Values Through Collaborative Work 
  Value Co-Creation in Ecosystems 
  Sociotechnical Strategies in Collaborative Systems 
  Proceedings were published by Springer, under the IFIP AICT series.
