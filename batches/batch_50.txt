 Knowledge Engineering (KE) refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based systems. KE is a multidisciplinary field, bringing in concepts and methods from several computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, expert systems, decision support systems, information systems and software engineering. KE is also related to logic (both in mathematics and philosophy domains) and to the cognitive and social sciences and socio-cognitive engineering.  
   
  Ontology Development (OD) aims at building reusable semantic structures that can be informal vocabularies, catalogs, glossaries as well as more complex finite formal structures specifying types of entities and types of relationships relevant within a certain domain. Ontologies have been gaining interest and acceptance in computational audiences. For example, formal ontologies are increasingly used as one of the main sources of software development and methodologies for this end can be adapted to include ontology development. A wide range of applications is emerging, including library science, ontology-enhanced search, e-commerce, business process management and enterprise engineering, among others.  
   
  KEOD aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and development of methodologies and technologies for Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development.

 Call for Participation: Peace!

 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”

 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 KEOD is part of IC3K    , the 15th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management.  
  Registration to KEOD allows free access to all other IC3K conferences.   
   
  IC3K 2023 will be held in conjunction with WEBIST 2023    , IN4PL 2023    and IJCCI 2023    .   
  Registration to IC3K allows free access to the WEBIST, IN4PL and IJCCI conferences (as a non-speaker).  

  New registrations are now only available at the conference welcome desk    

  Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).    
 Please visit the KEOD 2024 website   

 Knowledge Engineering (KE) refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based systems. KE is a multidisciplinary field, bringing in concepts and methods from several computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, expert systems, decision support systems, information systems and software engineering. KE is also related to logic (both in mathematics and philosophy domains) and to the cognitive and social sciences and socio-cognitive engineering.  
   
  Ontology Development (OD) aims at building reusable semantic structures that can be informal vocabularies, catalogs, glossaries as well as more complex finite formal structures specifying types of entities and types of relationships relevant within a certain domain. Ontologies have been gaining interest and acceptance in computational audiences. For example, formal ontologies are increasingly used as one of the main sources of software development and methodologies for this end can be adapted to include ontology development. A wide range of applications is emerging, including library science, ontology-enhanced search, e-commerce, business process management and enterprise engineering, among others.  
   
  KEOD aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and development of methodologies and technologies for Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development.

 KEOD is sponsored by INSTICC  – Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication  
    
  SCOPE  
 Knowledge Engineering (KE) refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based systems. KE is a multidisciplinary field, bringing in concepts and methods from several computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, expert systems, decision support systems and information systems. From the software development point of view, KE uses principles that are strongly related to software engineering. KE is also related to logic (both in mathematics and philosophy domains) and to the cognitive and social sciences and socio-cognitive engineering. Knowledge is considered to be produced by humans and structured according to our understanding of how human reasoning and logic works. Currently, KE is mostly related with the construction of shared conceptual frameworks, often designated as ontologies, hence the relevance given to this term in our conference.  
   
  Ontology Development (OD) aims at building reusable semantic structures that can be informal vocabularies, catalogs, glossaries as well as more complex finite formal structures specifying types of entities and types of relationships relevant within a certain domain. Ontologies have been gaining interest and acceptance in computational audiences. For example, formal ontologies are increasingly used as one of the main sources of software development and methodologies for this end can be adapted to include ontology development. A wide range of applications is emerging, especially given the current web emphasis, including library science, ontology-enhanced search, e-commerce and business process design. Of particular interest, is the development of ontologies and/or methods in the fields of enterprise engineering and enterprise architecture as it has been proven that many problems in software development occur due to incomplete specifications of an enterprise's needs, leading to a huge lack of success in software projects. It is then natural that one should strive to more fully capture and specify enterprise knowledge.  
   
  KEOD aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and development of methodologies and technologies for Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development.

We invite senior scientists who have a special interest in a specific conference topic to take responsibility for an invited session, gathering papers from a range of research expertise around the world.   
 Researchers who would like to organise one or more Invited Sessions on topics falling within the scope of the conference are invited to submit a proposal for consideration. |

 CFP: Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics – Your Submission Is Welcome!  
  October 19th, 2020  Daniela Lopez de Luise   

 The 12 th  International Multi-Conference on Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics: IMCIC 2021  , will be held on March 9 – 12, 2021  , in Orlando, Florida, USA.  
 You can submit an article at  : http://www.iiis-2021conf.org/imcic   
 This conference has always contemplated the two modalities of participation: face to face and virtual  . However, given the current Coronavirus situation and travel restrictions, at this moment we are only accepting submissions for virtual participation. If the situation changes and we feel the safety of our participants would not be at risk, we will start accepting submissions for face-to-face participation, and those authors who submitted their article for virtual participation will have the ability to change their participation modality to face-to-face, if they wish.  
 The Proceedings of IMCIC and ICSIT/ICETI have been indexed by Elsevier's SCOPUS  since 2010. The 2021 proceedings will also be sent to Elsevier's SCOPUS.  
 The conference will also be jointly held with:  
 The 12 | th | International Conference on Education, Training and Informatics: ICETI 2021 
  The 12 | th | International Conference on Society and Information Technologies: ICSIT 2021 
  More details regarding these and other collocated events and special tracks can be found at: http://www.iiis-2021conf.org/cfp-spring2021.asp   
 The deadlines  for this CFP are as follows:  
 October 27 th  , 2020 | : Article submissions 
  October 27 th  , 2020 | : Invited/Special session proposals 
  November 25 th  , 2020 | : Notifications of acceptance 
  December 15 th  , 2020 | : Uploading of camera-ready or final version 
  Both synchronous and asynchronous virtual presentations are possible  . Therefore, the authors who participate virtually in the conference have the option of:  
 Submitting a slide show and/or a pre-recorded video of their presentation (asynchronous presentation) or 
  Making their presentation via Zoom (synchronous presentation) 
  Additionally, each paper to be presented at the event, virtually or in-person, may be read and commented on, via electronic forums, and evaluated by those participants who have registered for the conference.  
 You also have the option to contribute as a member of the Organizing Committee by accepting our invitation for organizing an invited or special session  , where you would have the responsibility of promoting your session and reviewing the articles submitted to you. You should appoint your own reviewers to support you. Effective organizers will be included as co-editors of the volume of the proceedings in which the papers of the session(s) that they organized have been included. If you accept this invitation, please submit your proposal through the conference web site.  
 Keynote speakers will be selected from registered authors whose submissions are among the best according to their external reviewers. The identification of the best submissions will be based on the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the reviewers and the percentage of reviewers recommending the acceptance of the submission as related to all the reviewers who made their respective reviews. For this reason, we recommend you to submit your paper early  .  
 Registered authors of accepted submissions will be invited to make an additional presentation with no additional charge  , if such a presentation is oriented to inter-disciplinary communication. These authors will also have the option of writing an invited paper associated with their respective invited presentation.  
 Furthermore, the best papers presented at the conference, as selected by the audiences of each respective session, will also be published in the Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics (JCSI). JSCI is indexed in EBSCO, Cabell, DOAJ, and Google Scholar and is listed in Cabell Directory of Publishing Opportunities and in Ulrich's Periodical Directory.  
 For the past 25 years, professors, students, and researchers from all over the world have come together at our conferences to present research and engage in interdisciplinary discussion. It is this interdisciplinary focus that allows our attendees to discover new viewpoints they otherwise would not have discovered in a uni-disciplinary conference. These new viewpoints become intellectual seeds which, as they slowly bloom over time, expand their understanding of their own respective disciplines.  
 Many of our participants look forward to our conferences every year as they allow them to publish their papers, share their life's work, create a network of influential and like-minded colleagues, and expand their ever-growing understanding of their respective disciplines, as well as learn about new disciplines. Some testimonials can be read clicking on the button “  TESTIMONIALS” placed at the top of the left column of each of the conference web sites.  
 We hope to continue creating and expanding inter-disciplinary networks while facilitating the ever-growing expansion of each individual discipline represented at our conferences. We know this is only possible with contributions from people such as yourself. It is for this reason that we would greatly appreciate your contribution to the conference.  
 You are also welcome to forward this message to any appropriate colleagues and/or groups whose contributions would further promote the interdisciplinary growth of all the various disciplines represented in our conferences.  
 Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your contribution.  
 Respectfully,  
 IMCIC 2021 Organizing Committee

 Call for Papers  
   
  JSSPP welcomes Regular Papers (RP)  as well as descriptions of Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)  and Workload Traces (WT)  coming from interesting scheduling domains (see below). Our goal with the OSP papers is to build a bridge between the production and research worlds, enhancing mutual understanding and reproducibility to facilitate direct collaborations and impact. Our goal with the WT papers is to tackle the lack of real-world data that often hampers the ability of the research community to engage with scheduling problems in a way that has a real-world impact.  
 Call for Regular Papers (RP)  
 JSSPP solicits regular papers that focus on challenges in parallel scheduling, including but not limited to: Design of new scheduling approaches. 
  Performance evaluation of scheduling approaches, including methodology, benchmarks, and metrics. 
  Fulfilling additional constraints in scheduling systems, like job priorities, price, energy requirements (Green Computing), accounting, load estimation, and quality of service guarantees. 
  Impact of scheduling strategies on system utilization, application performance, user-friendliness, cost efficiency, and energy efficiency. 
  Scaling and architecture of very large scheduling systems. 
  Operational challenges: Capacity planning, service level assurance, reliability. 
  Interaction between schedulers on different levels (e.g., processor vs cluster) and tenancy domains (single and multi-tenant) 
  Interaction between applications/workloads, e.g., efficient batch job and container/Pod/VM co-scheduling within a single system, etc. 
  Experience reports from large-scale compute production systems. 
  GPU/Accelerator (co)scheduling. 
  AI/ML-inspired scheduling approaches. 
  Call for Workload Traces (WT)  
 JSSPP welcomes papers introducing workload traces from workloads of real systems that offer challenges in the context of this workshop. These submissions should include: Anonymized (if needed) workload artifacts that describe a significant share of individual units of resource scheduling (jobs, pods, VMs, functions, etc.) during a period of life in a parallel computing system. 
  A description of the parallel system running these workloads. 
  An analysis of the traces, modeling key workload features and highlighting scheduling challenges in their hosting systems. 
  We ask submitters to employ known workload description languages (e.g., SWF  ) to represent their traces or to attach schemas that allow interpreting them. The submission of artifacts that model the workloads is also encouraged. Call for Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)  
 JSSPP welcomes papers describing open problems in large-scale scheduling. We believe that clearly described real-world scheduling problems will help both the industry and the scientific communities to bridge the gap that often prevents the adoption of newly proposed scheduling techniques in practice. Effective scheduling approaches are predicated on three things: A concise understanding of scheduling goals, and how they relate to one another. 
  Details of the workload (job arrival times, sizes, shareability, deadlines, etc.) 
  Details of the system being managed (size, break/fix lifecycle, allocation constraints) 
  Submissions must include a concise description of the key metrics of the system and how they are calculated, as well as anonymized data publication of the system workload and production schedule. Ideally, anonymized operational logs would also be published, though we understand this might be more difficult. We envision that OSP papers will stimulate the development of new scheduling approaches, which can be robustly compared with the schedules used in production facilities, and other approaches to solve the same problems. Submission Format  
 Paper formatting requirements are the same for Regular Papers, Workload Traces, and OSP-related submissions. Papers should be no longer than 20 single-spaced pages, 10pt font, including figures and references. All submissions must follow the LNCS format  . See the instructions at Springer's website: http://www.springer.com/lncs  or in the Submission section  .  
   
 All papers in scope will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee  .  
  Submissions are accepted by EasyChair submission page  .  
   Submission is open

 Call for Papers  
   
  JSSPP welcomes Regular Papers (RP)  as well as descriptions of Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)  and Workload Traces (WT)  coming from interesting scheduling domains (see below). Our goal with the OSP papers is to build a bridge between the production and research worlds, enhancing mutual understanding and reproducibility to facilitate direct collaborations and impact. Our goal with the WT papers is to tackle the lack of real-world data that often hampers the ability of the research community to engage with scheduling problems in a way that has a real-world impact.  
 Call for Regular Papers (RP)  
 JSSPP solicits regular papers that focus on challenges in parallel scheduling, including but not limited to: Design of new scheduling approaches. 
  Performance evaluation of scheduling approaches, including methodology, benchmarks, and metrics. 
  Fulfilling additional constraints in scheduling systems, like job priorities, price, energy requirements (Green Computing), accounting, load estimation, and quality of service guarantees. 
  Impact of scheduling strategies on system utilization, application performance, user-friendliness, cost efficiency, and energy efficiency. 
  Scaling and architecture of very large scheduling systems. 
  Operational challenges: Capacity planning, service level assurance, reliability. 
  Interaction between schedulers on different levels (e.g., processor vs cluster) and tenancy domains (single and multi-tenant) 
  Interaction between applications/workloads, e.g., efficient batch job and container/Pod/VM co-scheduling within a single system, etc. 
  Experience reports from large-scale compute production systems. 
  GPU/Accelerator (co)scheduling. 
  AI/ML-inspired scheduling approaches. 
  Call for Workload Traces (WT)  
 JSSPP welcomes papers introducing workload traces from workloads of real systems that offer challenges in the context of this workshop. These submissions should include: Anonymized (if needed) workload artifacts that describe a significant share of individual units of resource scheduling (jobs, pods, VMs, functions, etc.) during a period of life in a parallel computing system. 
  A description of the parallel system running these workloads. 
  An analysis of the traces, modeling key workload features and highlighting scheduling challenges in their hosting systems. 
  We ask submitters to employ known workload description languages (e.g., SWF  ) to represent their traces or to attach schemas that allow interpreting them. The submission of artifacts that model the workloads is also encouraged. Call for Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)  
 JSSPP welcomes papers describing open problems in large-scale scheduling. We believe that clearly described real-world scheduling problems will help both the industry and the scientific communities to bridge the gap that often prevents the adoption of newly proposed scheduling techniques in practice. Effective scheduling approaches are predicated on three things: A concise understanding of scheduling goals, and how they relate to one another. 
  Details of the workload (job arrival times, sizes, shareability, deadlines, etc.) 
  Details of the system being managed (size, break/fix lifecycle, allocation constraints) 
  Submissions must include a concise description of the key metrics of the system and how they are calculated, as well as anonymized data publication of the system workload and production schedule. Ideally, anonymized operational logs would also be published, though we understand this might be more difficult. We envision that OSP papers will stimulate the development of new scheduling approaches, which can be robustly compared with the schedules used in production facilities, and other approaches to solve the same problems. Submission Format  
 Paper formatting requirements are the same for Regular Papers, Workload Traces, and OSP-related submissions. Papers should be no longer than 20 single-spaced pages, 10pt font, including figures and references. All submissions must follow the LNCS format  . See the instructions at Springer's website: http://www.springer.com/lncs  or in the Submission section  .  
   
 All papers in scope will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee  .  
  Submissions are accepted by EasyChair submission page  .  
   Submission is open

  Deadline for submissions : early May 2025  
  Conference future web site: www.kr.org/KR2025  

  Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and vibrant field of research within Artificial Intelligence. KR builds on the fundamental thesis that knowledge can often be represented in an explicit declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated  
  symbolic reasoning engines. This enables the exploitation of knowledge that would otherwise be implicit through semantically grounded inference mechanisms. KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas of AI, including agents, automated planning, robotics and natural language processing, and to fields beyond AI, including  
  data management, semantic web, verification, software engineering computational biology, and cybersecurity.  
   
  The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely, in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and practice of the representation and computational management of knowledge.  
   
  KR 2025 will consist of a number of tracks and events. It will include special thematic tracks and a Recently Published Research Track tutorials, workshops, and a Doctoral Consortium. Details about all these events and the corresponding calls will be on the website in due time.  
   
  We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR, which clearly contribute to the formal foundations of the field or show the applicability of KR techniques to implemented or implementable systems. We welcome papers from other areas that demonstrate clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KR. We also encourage "reports from the field" of applications, experiments, developments, and tests. Further details about the submission guidelines and the selection criteria will be on the website in due time.  
   
  -- Important Dates --  
   
  • Paper submission deadline: May, 2025  
  • Author notification: July, 2025

 Call for Tools Papers  
 The ICAPS 2025 Program Committee have introduced a new type of submission that follows the example of conferences such as TACAS  and CAV  to encourage and reward with visibility community efforts towards developing, maintaining and extending publicly available tools that enable and facilitate research into planning and scheduling.  
 It is common place that submissions to ICAPS include a brief section discussing implementation and engineering issues. The purpose of introducing a specific type of submissions with slightly different instructions to the rest is to put into focus the engineering issues in a self-contained and autonomous fashion, separate from contributions that focus on algorithms, theory or representations.  
 Doing so provides useful context to evaluate novelty of submissions. The subject of Tools papers can be refinements or optimizations of existing algorithms or techniques. Therefore, these submissions may not be novel from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but may well be so from an engineering perspective and have wide-ranging, long-standing impact.  
 For instance, the “two-literal watch rule” was not a significant innovation from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but its introduction along with other important techniques, had profound impacts in the applications and direction of research in Boolean Satisfiability.  
 Specific Instructions for Tools Papers  
 Submissions must describe tools of broad interest and utility to the ICAPS community.  
 Tools papers are required to provide an “artifact” along with a paper (either long or short) whose format and content satisfies the requirements given in the Call for Papers  . Arfifacts are defined as additional material (software, data sets, etc.) that substantiates claims made in the paper and renders them fully replicable  . An artifact may for instance consist of a tool and its accompanying documentation, the input files used for the evaluation of the tool in the paper, and configuration files or other documents that describe the parameters used in the experiments.  
 Papers in this category must clearly describe the problem to be solved, its importance, related work, the techniques used in the tool and their novelty, the construction of the tool, its unique features, a discussion of how the tool is used and an evaluation of the usefulness of the tool along with a comparison with other tools and previous versions of the tool.  
 Reviewers are instructed to read the corresponding paper and evaluate the artifact according to the following criteria included in our instructions for reviewers  :  
 consistency with and replicability of results presented in the paper, 
  completeness, 
  documentation and ease of use, 
  availability in a permanent online repository. 
  There is no requirement of anonymising the artifact, so these submissions are de-facto single-blind  . Still, we expect that the paper submitted for review satisfy the requirements of double-blind review outlined in the Call for Papers  .  
 Artifact Submission  
 Artifacts must be submitted as part of the Supplementary Materials section in the OpenReview submission form. The following text files must be found in the ZIP archive submitted as supplementary materials:  
 an abstract (ABSTRACT) that summarises the artifact and its relation to the paper, 
  a license document (LICENSE) for the artifact that must, at the very least, allow the assigned PC members to evaluate the artifact, 
  an instructions document (README) that includes: | a hyperlink to the artifact (not the binary or source code of the artifact), 
  a script to install and configure the artifact (e.g. Docker file or similar), 
  detailed instructions that enable the PC to quickly verify that the artifact is running properly, 
  detailed instructions for using the artifact to replicate the results in the paper, including estimated resources if these are non-trivial. 
  We recommend the use of Markdown  to format these text files. We recommend that artifacts are configured for broad availability: Ubuntu 22.04 or better, Windows and MacOs. Broad availability is one of the criteria for evaluating submissions.  
 The artifact hyperlink must point to a service or repository that allows interaction with or downloading the artifact in a completely anonymous fashion  . Failure to do so, or active attempts to identify the PC members reviewing the artifact, will lead to summary desk rejection  .

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 An  International  Journal  (IDT)  enters  its  16th   
 year:  A  short  note  from  the  editors   
 George  A.  Tsihrintzis,  Gloria  Phillips-Wren,  Lakhmi  C  Jain  and  Junzo  W  atada   
 Intelligent  Decision  T  echnologies  (IDT):  An  Inter-   
 national  Journal  (https://www  .iospress.com/catalog/    
 journals/intelligent-decision-technologies)  is  dedicated   
 to  the  advancement  and  dissemination  of  research  re-   
 sults  and  knowledge  in  the  theory  and  application  of   
 intelligent  technologies  and  systems  in  support  of  de-   
 cision  making.  The  IDT  Journal  is  afﬁliated  with  KES   
 International  (http://www.k  esinternational.org/),  “a  pro-   
 fessional  community,  with  networking,  research  and   
 publication  opportunities  for  all  those  who  work  in   
 knowledge-intensive  subjects”.  KES  sponsors  interna-   
 tional  conferences  on  leading-edge  topics,  including  an   
 annual  conference  for  Intelligent  Decision  Technolo-   
 gies.   
 The  idea  of  the  IDT  Journal  originated  through  dis-   
 cussions  between  Professor/Dr.  Gloria  Phillips-Wren   
 and  Professor/Dr.  Lakhmi  C.  Jain  at  the  Kno  wledge   
 Engineering  Systems  (KES)  International  annual  con-   
 ferences  in  the  timeframe  of  2004–2006.  The  spark  that   
 at  the  time  inspired  the  two  Professors  to  initiate  the   
 IDT  Journal  lay  in  the  fact  that,  while  research  mainly   
 focused  on  algorithms  and  technical  speciﬁcations,  the   
 technology  was  also  becoming  mature  enough  to  be   
 implemented  into  real-world  decision  support  systems   
 (DSS)  for  previously  intractable  problems.   
 Thus,  the  IDT  Journal  was  launched  in  2007.   
 Profs./Drs.  Lakhmi  C.  Jain  and  Gloria  Phillips-Wren   
 introduced  the  IDT  Journal  to  the  research  community   
 with  an  editorial  note  stating  that  “ The  purpose  of  this    
 peer  reviewed,  sc  holarly  journal  is  to  develop  a  forum   
 for  theoretical  and  applied  resear  ch  that  combines  ar-   
 tiﬁcial  intelligence  based  in  computer  science,  deci-   
 sion  support  based  in  information  technology  ,  and  sys-   
 tems  development  based  in  engineering  science.  Inter-   
 disciplinary  advances  in  these  ﬁelds  have  the  poten-   
 tial  to  signiﬁcantly  improve  individual  and  or  ganiza-   
 tional  decision  making.  The  growth  of  the  internet  with   
 its  concomitant  availability  of  data  has  exploded  the   
 amount  and  types  of  information  that  must  be  consid-   
 ered  by  a  decision  maker  .  Decisions  must  often  be  made   
 in  real-time  under  uncertain,  stressful  conditions  that   
 may  change  rapidly  .  Synergies  between  intelligent  and   
 information  technologies  can,  for  example,  deliver  arti-   
 ﬁcial  intelligence  to  enhance  human  judgment,  perceive   
 anomalies  in  data,  enable  collaboration,  speed  process-   
 ing  of  new  information,  assist  in  risk  assessment,  iden-   
 tify  and  retrieve  needed  knowledge,  sug  gest  alternatives   
 to  the  decision  maker  ,  and  automate  some  decisional   
 tasks.  W  e  look  forward  to  the  dialogue  within  this  com-   
 munity  and  welcome  your  resear  ch  for  publication ”  [1].    
 Since  its  launch,  the  IDT  Journal  is  in  continuous   
 circulation  with  a  new  issue  published  quarterly  by   
 IOS  Press  (https://www.iospress.com/)  headquartered   
 in  Amsterdam,  the  Netherlands.  At  the  same  time,  the   
 ﬁeld  of  intelligent  decision  support  has  been  enjoying   
 continuous  and  rapid  expansion  in  theory  ,  paradigms   
 and  real-world  systems  and  applications.  This  expan-   
 sion  is  due  to  parallel  advances  and  efﬁciencies  in  such   
 enabling  technologies  as  (1)  Artiﬁcial  Intelligence  (AI);   
 (2)  connectivity  between  devices  such  as  the  Inter-   
 net  of  Things  (IoT);  (3)  data  storage,  processing  and   
 transmission  in  distributed,  virtualized  and  network-   
 centric  environments  (e.g.  cloud  technologies);  (4)  re-   
 markable  computer  and  internet  transmission  speeds;

 Among the primary aims of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the enhancement of User Experience (UX) by providing deep understanding, profound empathy, tailored assistance, useful recommendations, and natural communication with human interactants while they are achieving their goals through computer use. To this end, AI is used in varying techniques to automate sophisticated functions in UX and thereby changing what UX is apprehended by the users. This is achieved through the development of intelligent interactive systems such as virtual assistants, recommender systems, and intelligent tutoring systems. The changes are well received, as technological achievements but create new challenges of trust, explainability and usability to humans, which in turn need to be amended by further advancements of AI in reciprocity. AI can be utilised to enhance the UX of a system while the quality of the UX can influence the effectiveness of AI. The state of the art in AI for UX is constantly evolving, with a growing focus on designing transparent, explainable, and fair AI systems that prioritise user control and autonomy, protect user data privacy and security, and promote diversity and inclusivity in the design process. Staying up to date with the latest advancements and best practices in this field is crucial. This paper conducts a critical analysis of published academic works and research studies related to AI and UX, exploring their interrelationship and the cause-effect cycle between the two. Ultimately, best practices for achieving a successful interrelationship of AI in UX are identified and listed based on established methods or techniques that have been proven to be effective in previous research reviewed.

 Overview  
 The topic of the track covers an important field of research in Artificial Intelligence: KRR is indeed a trending topic (for instance, its Argumentation-theory subfield). A similar dedicated conference is the International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, but all the major conferences in AI (e.g., AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS, ECAI) have KRR among their topics of interest. KRR track will be a venue for all the researchers and practitioners working on the fundaments (but also applications) of reasoning, and the cross-fertilization among different approaches (e.g., Argumentation and Belief Revision).  
  Scope  
 Knowledge-representation and Reasoning (KRR) is the field of artificial intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations that capture information about the world that can be used to solve complex problems. Its goal is to understand and build intelligent behavior from the top down, focusing on what an agent needs to know with the purpose to behave intelligently, how this knowledge can be represented symbolically, and how automated reasoning procedures can make this knowledge available as needed. In KRR a fundamental assumption is that an agent's knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated reasoning engines. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Argumentation 
  Constraint solving, programming, technologies 
  Belief revision and update, belief merging, etc. 
  Commonsense reasoning 
  Contextual reasoning 
  Description logics 
  Diagnosis, abduction, explanation 
  Inconsistency- and exception tolerant reasoning, para-consistent logics 
  KR and autonomous agents: intelligent agents, cognitive robotics multi-agent systems 
  KR and decision making, game theory, social choice 
  KR and machine learning, inductive logic programming, knowledge discovery and acquisition 
  Logic programming, answer set programming, constraint logic programming 
  Non-monotonic logics, default logics, conditional logics 
  Preferences: modeling and representation, preference-based reasoning 
  Reasoning about knowledge and belief, dynamic epistemic logic epistemic and doxastic logics 
  Reasoning systems and solvers, knowledge compilation 
  Spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning, qualitative reasoning 
  Uncertainty, representations of vagueness, many-valued and fuzzy logics 
   Submissions  
 We would like to invite authors to submit papers on research on KRR area, with particular emphasis on assessing the current state of the art and identifying future directions. Original papers addressing any of the listed topics of interest (or related topics) will be considered. Each submitted paper will be fully refereed and undergo a double-blind review process by at least three referees. Accepted papers will be included in the ACM SAC 2024 proceedings and published in the ACM digital library, being indexed by Thomson ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus.

The KRR  track serves as a venue for researchers and practitioners working on the fundamentals and applications of reasoning, fostering cross-fertilization among different approaches such as Argumentation and Belief Revision.  
 KRR  is a crucial area of artificial intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations to capture information about the world, enabling the solution of complex problems.

 About Us  
 The importance of studying knowledge science, knowledge engineering and knowledge management has been recognized widely. We could cite Feigenbaum’s words in his book The fifth generation, Artificial Intelligence and Japan’s Computer challenge to the World, for demonstrating the point:  
 “Knowledge is not the same as information. Knowledge is Information that has been pared, shaped, interpreted, selected, and transformed” 
  “Knowledge is power, and the computer is an amplifier of that power. We are now at the dawn of a new computer revolution…the transition from information processing to knowledge processing” 
  “…establish a ‘knowledge industry’ in which knowledge itself will be a salable commodity like food and oil. Knowledge itself is to become the wealth of nations”. 

 Our Aim  
 Making available information about KSEM conferences among people who are interested in it. 
  Serving as a representative forum for experts within the KSEM related field. 
  Distributing KSEM related information and knowledge, e.g papers, projects, news, discussions and even blogs

 Conference Overview  
   
 In this digital age, data plays a crucial role Businesses/organizations across the globe are striving to analyze the data and identify the trends. Data evaluations also give organizations new insights to questions that they hadn’t even thought of. This creates a positive impact on discovering new business opportunities. Data visualization and visual analytics are two such ways to gain better insights into data. Though often used interchangeably, these two terms are inherently different as are their approaches to data. This International Conference on Visual Analytics and Data Visualization (ICVADV-2025) covers all research, development, and application aspects of Visual Analytics and Data Visualization. This international conference event intends to serve as a platform for discussing the recent advances in algorithms, methods, theory, and applications of visual analytics and data visualization. The conference encourages the discussion on recent findings in the design and utilization of data analytics and visualization tools.

 Creating Data for Learning Analytics Ecosystems  
 Authors:  Kirsty Kitto, John Whitmer, Aaron E. Silvers, and Michael Webb  
 Publication Date:  September 2020  
 Learning is a complex process that involves rich interactions between people, politics, places, and increasingly, technology. Using clickstream data to provide deep insights into learning requires care and a system-wide approach. We need learning analytics ecosystems. This position paper discusses the challenges faced by institutions as they seek to wrangle data from a portfolio of technology products and services to deliver rich learning experiences. It identifies a number of systemic failures that are leading many institutions to collect a large quantity of data that yields very few educationally relevant insights; from a lack of data policies to competition between vendors and standards. This position paper provides several high-level recommendations for three different sets of stakeholders to consider as they move towards a more mature implementation of LA: (i) Institutions procuring EdTech products; (ii) EdTech vendors seeking to deliver analytics products, and (iii) The LA community of practitioners. We also provide detailed evidence and examples in a series of appendices that are pitched at more technical members of your organisation as you seek to build a robust and useful learning analytics ecosystem.

  General Call  
  
 The 2025 edition of  The International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge (LAK25)   will take place in-person in Dublin, Ireland. LAK25 is organized by the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) with Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin). LAK25 is a collaborative effort by researchers and practitioners to share the most rigorous cutting edge work in learning analytics.   
 The theme for the 15th annual LAK conference is  Expanding the Horizons of Learning Analytics   . After this many years of research and practice, the Learning Analytics field has established its own identity, traditions, and community. Pursuing our initial objective of making use of data to better understand and improve learning processes, we have studied and impacted numerous aspects of both formal and informal education. However, as the field enters its teenage years, it faces swift and significant shifts in technological, theoretical, and pedagogical contexts that have a direct effect on our work. For instance, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the yet-to-be-proven promise of facilitating and democratizing data analysis, while also posing significant ethical challenges. Critical theories prompt us to examine the values and unintended consequences of our contributions. Novel educational models demand innovative methods for studying learning processes and measuring and assessing learning outcomes.   
 In response, the community is actively reassessing and reshaping what it means to “do learning analytics” within these evolving environments. This process of reinvention often involves stepping out of our comfort zone, established during the field’s formative years, to explore new theories, learning processes, data sources, communication modalities, analytical methods, delivery mechanisms, structures for ownership and adoption, and even reconsidering who leads and implements the analytics process. This year's conference aims to highlight and celebrate the trailblazing works that are expanding the horizons of the learning analytics field.   
 The LAK conference is intended for both researchers and practitioners  . We invite both researchers and practitioners of learning analytics to come and join a proactive dialogue around the future of learning analytics and its practical adoption. We further extend our invite to educators, leaders, administrators, government and industry professionals interested in the field of learning analytics and its related disciplines.   
 Authors should note that:   
 The LAK conference has received a | CORE ranking | of A (top 16% of all 783 ranked venues). 
  LAK is the only conference in the | top 20 Google Scholar citation ranks for educational technology publications. 

 Conference Theme and Topics  
 We welcome submissions from both research and practice, encompassing different theoretical, methodological, empirical and technical contributions to the learning analytics field. Learning analytics research draws on many distinct academic fields, including psychology, the learning sciences, education, neuroscience, computer science and design. We encourage the submission of work conducted in any of these traditions, as long as it is done rigorously. We also welcome research that validates, replicates and examines the generalizability of previously published findings, as well as examines aspects of adoption of existing learning analytics methods and approaches.   
 Specifically, this year, in line with the conference main theme of  Expanding the Horizons of Learning Analytics   , we encourage authors to address some of the following questions in their submissions:   
 Expanding our Theoretical Perspectives: | Bringing new theoretical lenses and deepening connections to existing theoretical approaches towards improved understanding of teaching and learning processes. 
  Expanding the Types and Complexity of Data: | Multisource and multimodal data paired with relevant and pedagogically valid data fusion strategies. 
  Expanding our Methodological Toolbox: | New ways to collect and analyze data, design learning analytics interventions, and evaluate impact. Special attention will be given to novel uses of Generative AI. 
  Expanding our Delivery Mechanisms: | Going beyond traditional dashboard and data visualizations. 
  Expanding our Ethical Considerations: | How learning analytics is helping (or not) to create a more just and inclusive future for all learners. 
  Expanding our Approaches to Responsible Data Use and Analytics | : Adopting novel approaches and technologies to ensure privacy protection and trustworthy analytics 
  Reaching out New Populations and Stakeholders: | Diversifying the groups of people we usually work with, including expansion of our geographical and cultural reach. 
  Rethinking the Learning Analytics practice: | Novel ways to empower stakeholders in co-designing, leading, and executing learning analytics processes. 
  Disclaimer:  The authors are not required to address the theme of the conference and the consideration of the papers for acceptance will not be based on their fit to the conference theme.

 The practitioner track is part of the main conference program and provides a way in which real-world learning analytics implementations in use by practitioners can be shared with the entire community. The intent of the stream is to contribute to our collective understanding of learning analytics in practice, analysis of the use of learning analytics in product development and improvement, learning analytics intervention deployment, research-based evaluations of learning analytics implementations and methodologies. Specifically, some of the goals of practitioner presentations are to:   
 contribute to the conversation between researchers and practitioners around adoption, implementation, scaling and evaluation of learning analytics, 
  provide insights from practice around factors enabling or constraining learning analytics adoption and implementation, 
  conduct critical analysis of learning analytics adoption strategies and approaches, and/or 
  share experiences on developing a business case for learning analytics adoption. 
  provide experience of innovative evaluation methodologies or approaches. 
  To meet these goals, submissions are encouraged to reflect on the context and purpose of the presented learning analytics initiative, discuss implementation, outcomes, impacts, and learning, and consider implications for others attempting similar work. We also encourage submissions where an initiative did not achieve what was expected, as we believe that such examples provide valuable knowledge to the community.   
 We welcome submissions that fall in the scope described above from anyone regardless of their institutional roles. Some examples of practitioner participants are:   
 Educators, students, learning/instructional designers, faculty developers, and other staff directly involved in learning, teaching, and assessment within educational institutions. 
  Policy makers, department leads, instructional technologists, analysts, and other services staff from education institutions. 
  Developers, designers, analysts, and other representatives from commercial and industry entities, non-profit organizations, and government bodies. 
  Corporate trainers, instructors and other staff involved in the skills development of employees, alternative credentialing models and the impact on using data to guide corporate learning programs. 
  S  uccessful submissions are expected to offer unique or distinct insights into practical applications, intervention designs, analyses, and/or the processes surrounding their implementation.   
 The more complete the report of the work is, including usage of the learning analytics and their impact, the higher the probability of being selected for inclusion. Submissions should include:   
 thorough description of the institutional/organizational context for the work, 
  the background of why the initiative was implemented and/or product was developed, 
  detailed presentation of its implementation and results, 
  discussion of issues that arose / lessons learned / implications for future efforts by others in the LAK community attempting similar work. 
  The following criteria will guide reviewers when selecting submissions, although we recognise that this list may not be applicable to all submissions. Authors are encouraged to consider the following when preparing their submissions:   
 Learning/education related | : The submission should describe work that utilizes learning analytics, either at an educational institution or in an area (such as corporate training, health care or informal learning) where the goal is to improve the learning environment or the learning outcomes. 
  Stakeholder involvement | : All submissions should include perspectives from people who have participated in the initiative or intervention in a learning environment, and/or have been impacted by it (such as faculty, students, administrators and trainees). 
  No sales pitches | : While submissions from commercial suppliers are welcomed, reviewers will not accept overt (or covert) sales pitches. Reviewers will look for evidence that the presentation will take into account challenges faced, problems that have arisen, and/or user feedback that needs to be addressed. 
   
 Practitioner Report  (2-4 page document, using the  SoLAR companion proceedings template   )  should include accounts and findings that stem from practical experience in implementing learning analytics projects incorporating the following sections:   
  
 Presenter’s Names (Left blank for double blind submission // Only add in for camera-ready version) 
  Presentation Title: 
  Abstract (100-150 words): 
  Keywords (up to 10): 
  Full Presentation Description 
   
 All accepted submissions to the Practitioner track will be published in the LAK25 Companion Proceedings and archived on the  SoLAR website   .   

 Posters | (3 pages, | SoLAR companion proceedings template | ) represent i) a concise report of recent findings or other types of innovative work not ready to be submitted as a full or short research paper or ii) a description of a practical learning analytics project implementation which may not be ready to be presented as a practitioner report. Poster presentations are part of the LAK Poster & Demo session, and authors are given a physical board to present and discuss their projects with delegates. 
  Interactive demos | (200 words abstract in | SoLAR companion proceedings template | + 5 min video) provide opportunities to showcase interactive learning analytics tools. Interactive demonstrations are part of the LAK Poster & Demo session, and presenters are given a physical space to demonstrate their latest learning analytics projects, tools, and systems. Demos should be used to communicate innovative user interface designs, visualizations, or another novel functionality that tackles a real user problem. Tools may be prototypes in an early stage of development or relatively mature products. In whichever stage, tools should have been field-tested with an authentic use case and provide some results and feedback. Submissions for conceptual products or for products that have not been used by instructors and/or students are unlikely to be accepted. 

 The focus of pre-conference events is on providing space for new and emerging ideas in learning analytics and their further development. Events can have either research or practical focus and can be structured in the way which best serves their particular purpose.   
 The types of submissions for the pre-conference event track are:   
 Workshops | (4 pages, | SoLAR companion proceedings template | ) provide an efficient forum for community building, sharing of perspectives, training, and idea generation for specific and emerging research topics or viewpoints. Successful proposals should be explicit regarding the kind of activities participants should expect, for example from interactive/generative participatory sessions to mini-conference or symposium sessions. 
  Tutorials | (4 pages, | SoLAR companion proceedings template | ) aim to educate stakeholders on a specific learning analytics topic and/or stakeholder perspective. Proposals should be clear about what the need is for particular knowledge, target audience and their prior knowledge, and the intended learning outcomes. 

 For more information please review the Leadership Academy Call  .   
 Submission Deadline is October 7, 2024 11:59 PM AOE.  

 For more information please review the Doctoral Consortium Call  .   
 Submission Deadline is October 7, 2024 11:59 PM AOE.  

 Review Process  
 LAK25 will use a  double-blind peer review process for all submissions except demos, pre-conference events, the doctoral consortium and the leadership academy  (which each require elements that prevent blinding). To continue to strengthen the review process for both authors and reviewers LAK25 will have a  rebuttal phase for full and short research papers  in which authors will be given  seven days  to flag any inaccuracies, omissions, or errors in the reviews  in a maximum of  500 words  . Rebuttals are  optional  , and there is no requirement to respond. Authors should keep in mind that papers are being  evaluated as submitted  and thus, responses should not propose new results or restructuring of the presentation. Therefore, rebuttals should focus on answering specific questions raised by reviewers (if any) and providing clarifications and justifications to reviewers. Meta-reviewers, senior members of the research community, make final recommendations for paper acceptance or rejection with justification to the program committee chairs after the rebuttal phase is concluded. Acceptance decisions are ultimately taken by the program committee chairs based on all available information from the review process in combination with the constraints of the allowable space in the conference program.   

 Proceedings Publication  
 Accepted full and short research papers will be included in the LAK25 conference proceedings published and archived by ACM. Other types of submissions (posters, demos, workshops, tutorials, practitioner reports and doctoral consortium) will be included in the open access LAK companion proceedings, published on SoLAR’s website. Please note at least  one of the authors of each accepted submission must register for the conference by the Early Bird deadline  in order for the paper to be included in the ACM or LAK Companion Proceedings.   
 Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model:   
 ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here: https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance  .  
 Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows:  
 Full details of the new ICPS publishing model: https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/faq   
  Full details of the ACM Open program: https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess   
 Please direct all questions about the new model to icps-info@acm.org.

 IEEE LANMAN has an established tradition as a forum for presenting and discussing the latest technical advances in local and metropolitan area networking. Cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation are solicited in all areas of networking. In keeping with the heritage of the symposium, there will be a central theme, and in 2024 the theme is “ Emerging Technologies for Future Networks  .”  
 The Internet is lately experiencing an unprecedented growth in size and use. Now, more than ever there is a need for building networks that allow for low-latency and high throughput communications, in order to support emerging applications such as Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and autonomous driving, to name a few. This trend poses new challenges in the operations of networks. Here, recent advances in emerging wireless technologies ,  encompassing high and very high frequencies, combined with new technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent surfaces, Massive-MIMO, and Cell-free systems,  provide new opportunities for designing innovative solutions that allow new applications with ever-increasing constraints in terms of end-to-end response time and available bandwidth to run smoothly.  
 The intimate single-track format of the symposium encourages stimulating exchanges between researchers. The event is expected to be a forum for discussion of new and interdisciplinary ideas on network access protocols, network management and control, services and applications.  
 Papers are solicited on any topic in networking, including, but not limited to:  
 AI and machine learning for local and metropolitan area networking 
  AI and machine learning for network measurement and traffic analysis 
  Self-learning network architectures 
  Networking designs for AI and machine learning 
  Networking for online education and entertainment 
  Networking protocols and architectures for the IoTs 
  Machine-to-machine communication 
  Cloud, edge and fog computing integration 
  Co-existence and heterogeneity support at the edge (HetNets) 
  Energy efficiency for local and metropolitan area networking 
  5G and 6G cellular data networking 
  Information security for local and metropolitan area networking 
  Intelligent routing, forwarding, and scheduling 
  Network and transport mechanisms for latency reduction 
  Network virtualization in local and metropolitan areas 
  Performance and reliability of local and metropolitan area networks 
  Software-defined networking in local and metropolitan areas 
  Information-centric networking in local and metropolitan areas 
  IEEE LANMAN 2024 solicits paper submissions of papers up to 6 pages. Some regular paper submissions may be accepted as short papers (2 pages) by the TPC. The page limits include all figures, tables, and references. All papers must be electronically submitted in PDF according to the guidelines in the symposium website http://www.ieee-lanman.org  . The proceedings will be published in IEEE Xplore and will include both short and regular papers presented at the symposium. A best paper award will be awarded.  
 In addition to the regular paper track, we will organize a demonstration session. The aim is to foster interactive discussions on work-in-progress, new problem statements, and ideas for future development related to LANMAN topics, and display innovative prototypes. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to submit demo proposals as a further chance to showcase their papers.

 Minlan Yu (Harvard University, USA)    
 Abstract:  As applications become highly distributed, the need for high-performance communication and coordination between servers becomes critical. Unfortunately, today's network abstractions and network stacks significantly limit performance optimization due to their generic for diverse applications: Traditional network abstractions focus on individual connections, missing the potential benefits of coordinating groups of connections in distributed systems. Efforts on network-layer performance optimization sometimes lead to more computation at applications. Layers of network stacks in the kernel, which are essential for security and resource sharing, introduce significant overhead.  
 In this talk, I advocate for application-customized networking, which empowers applications to specify their own communication needs and optimizations in the network layer. This approach enables applications to coordinate across connections, perform end-to-end optimizations, and reduce kernel overhead, all while retaining the security and resource-sharing benefits of the kernel. I will give two examples of application-customized networking: First, for distributed transaction systems, we introduce DINT, which leverages eBPF to support frequent-path transaction operations directly in the kernel. DINT achieves up to 2.6× higher throughput than using a DPDK-based kernel-bypass stack, with only a maximum of 10% increase in average unloaded latency. Second, for distributed deep learning, we introduce THC, a bidirectional tensor homomorphic compression framework that enables the direct aggregation of compressed values and thus eliminates the computational overheads of (de)compression at the parameter server. THC reaches target accuracy up to 1.47× faster compared with state-of-the-art systems.

 Abstract  : Wi-Fi, a cornerstone of global wireless connectivity, is estimated to carry anywhere between 50% to 80% of the world's Internet traffic volume. Recent strides in Wi-Fi technology, exemplified by Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7, showcase remarkable achievements in meeting escalating data demands through innovations like OFDMA, wider 320 MHz channels, 4K QAM modulation, and multi-link operation, enabling aggregate peak data rates exceeding 30 Gbps. While these advancements are commendable, the future of Wi-Fi extends beyond raw speed. Anticipating the next decade, this presentation centers on the imperative for Wi-Fi to evolve into a reliable, deterministic, and intelligent network foundation. This evolution is essential to cater to emerging applications such as contextual computing, environmental sensing, multi-device experiences, gesture recognition, AR/VR, ambient and industrial IoT, and gaming. As such, in this talk, we navigate through Wi-Fi's historical journey, and its current state, and illuminate the major technological trends shaping the next decade. Emphasis is placed on the development of key technologies required to bring determinism and intelligence to Wi-Fi, thus addressing the diverse and complex needs of the future.

 Creating Data for Learning Analytics Ecosystems  
 Authors:  Kirsty Kitto, John Whitmer, Aaron E. Silvers, and Michael Webb  
 Publication Date:  September 2020  
 Learning is a complex process that involves rich interactions between people, politics, places, and increasingly, technology. Using clickstream data to provide deep insights into learning requires care and a system-wide approach. We need learning analytics ecosystems. This position paper discusses the challenges faced by institutions as they seek to wrangle data from a portfolio of technology products and services to deliver rich learning experiences. It identifies a number of systemic failures that are leading many institutions to collect a large quantity of data that yields very few educationally relevant insights; from a lack of data policies to competition between vendors and standards. This position paper provides several high-level recommendations for three different sets of stakeholders to consider as they move towards a more mature implementation of LA: (i) Institutions procuring EdTech products; (ii) EdTech vendors seeking to deliver analytics products, and (iii) The LA community of practitioners. We also provide detailed evidence and examples in a series of appendices that are pitched at more technical members of your organisation as you seek to build a robust and useful learning analytics ecosystem.

 Open Learning Analytics: an integrated & modularized platform  
 Authors:  George Siemens, Dragan Gasevic, Caroline Haythornthwaite, Shane Dawson, Simon Buckingham Shum, Rebecca Ferguson, Erik Duval, Katrien Verbert, Ryan S. J. d. Baker  
 Publication Date:  July 2011  
 Proposal to design, implement and evaluate an open platform to integrate heterogeneous learning analytics techniques   
 Significant potential exists for analytics to guide learners, educators, administrators, and funders in making learning-related decisions. Learning analytics represent the application of “big data” and analytics in education. This proposal expresses the importance of a planned and integrated approach to developing insightful and easy-to-use learning analytics tools.

 IEEE LANMAN has an established tradition as a forum for presenting and discussing the latest technical advances in local and metropolitan area networking. Cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation are solicited in all areas of networking. In keeping with the heritage of the symposium, there will be a central theme, and in 2024 the theme is “ Emerging Technologies for Future Networks  .”  
 The Internet is lately experiencing an unprecedented growth in size and use. Now, more than ever there is a need for building networks that allow for low-latency and high throughput communications, in order to support emerging applications such as Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and autonomous driving, to name a few. This trend poses new challenges in the operations of networks. Here, recent advances in emerging wireless technologies ,  encompassing high and very high frequencies, combined with new technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent surfaces, Massive-MIMO, and Cell-free systems,  provide new opportunities for designing innovative solutions that allow new applications with ever-increasing constraints in terms of end-to-end response time and available bandwidth to run smoothly.  
 The intimate single-track format of the symposium encourages stimulating exchanges between researchers. The event is expected to be a forum for discussion of new and interdisciplinary ideas on network access protocols, network management and control, services and applications.  
 Papers are solicited on any topic in networking, including, but not limited to:  
 AI and machine learning for local and metropolitan area networking 
  AI and machine learning for network measurement and traffic analysis 
  Self-learning network architectures 
  Networking designs for AI and machine learning 
  Networking for online education and entertainment 
  Networking protocols and architectures for the IoTs 
  Machine-to-machine communication 
  Cloud, edge and fog computing integration 
  Co-existence and heterogeneity support at the edge (HetNets) 
  Energy efficiency for local and metropolitan area networking 
  5G and 6G cellular data networking 
  Information security for local and metropolitan area networking 
  Intelligent routing, forwarding, and scheduling 
  Network and transport mechanisms for latency reduction 
  Network virtualization in local and metropolitan areas 
  Performance and reliability of local and metropolitan area networks 
  Software-defined networking in local and metropolitan areas 
  Information-centric networking in local and metropolitan areas 
  IEEE LANMAN 2024 solicits paper submissions of papers up to 6 pages. Some regular paper submissions may be accepted as short papers (2 pages) by the TPC. The page limits include all figures, tables, and references. All papers must be electronically submitted in PDF according to the guidelines in the symposium website http://www.ieee-lanman.org  . The proceedings will be published in IEEE Xplore and will include both short and regular papers presented at the symposium. A best paper award will be awarded.  
 In addition to the regular paper track, we will organize a demonstration session. The aim is to foster interactive discussions on work-in-progress, new problem statements, and ideas for future development related to LANMAN topics, and display innovative prototypes. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to submit demo proposals as a further chance to showcase their papers.

 Submission  
  
 Submissions must be in ACM SIGPLAN subformat of the acmart format (available at and explained in more detail at https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/  ). Each paper should be in 10pt font and have no more than 10 pages for full papers  or 4 pages for work-in-progress papers  , excluding the bibliography. There is a 2-page limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al.). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Submissions must be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4-sized paper. For papers in the work-in-progress category, add the suffix “(WIP)” to your title, such as “Title (WIP)”.   
 To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, 
  references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.  
 ACM Publications Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start, and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting the paper, the authors agree that if the paper is accepted, one author will have to register at the conference rate and present the paper in person at the LCTES 2024 conference.

 Speaker's Guide  
   
 LCTES’24 Speaker’s Guide   
 This document is for those presenting a paper at LCTES’24. If you’re presenting at ISMM, PLDI, or a PLDI tutorial or workshop, please see the Speaker’s Guide on the page for the corresponding conference/track.  
 Congratulations on having your paper accepted at LCTES’24! This document will help ensure your presentation runs smoothly and has the best possible audience impact. Please read it in its entirety.  
 Checklist   
 Before LCTES:  
 Prepare and practice. 
  Each presentation slot lasts for | 15 minutes, including 12 minutes of presentation and 3 minutes of Q&A | . 
  Upload a backup copy of your talk slides (details below). 
  Check the program to establish when and where your talk will be. 
  Ensure you have a | HDMI adaptor | for your device. 
  Before your talk:  
 Familiarize yourself with the room you will be speaking in. 
  Find and introduce yourself to your session chair. 
  Ensure that you are in the room | no later than 5 minutes | before your session. 
  After your talk:  
 Expect questions from the floor and session chair. 
  Preparing Your Talk   
 Your work will have a greater impact if you’re well prepared.  
 It is very important that you run to schedule. The LCTES’24 schedule is extremely tight, with hard stops imposed by FCRC scheduling. Session chairs have been asked to stick rigidly to the schedule.  
 Guidelines   
 Your talk should run for no more than 12 minutes, uninterrupted. This gives you about three minutes for questions and speaker change-over. 
  Your talk should be prepared for the standard | 16:9 widescreen ratio | . If your talk is in a different ratio, at best it will be | pillarboxed | , wasting screen real estate and diminishing impact, and at worst, it won’t display correctly. 
  You will present your talk from a lectern, using a fixed lectern mic. 
  You will need to provide your talk ahead of time in either pdf or powerpoint. 
  Uploading Your Presentation   
 As an insurance against technical failures, we ask all speakers to make a backup copy of their presentation available to the video team by uploading it the day before the session. You’re welcome to upload fresh copies at any time.  
 Format: your presentation must be saved as a | powerpoint or pdf | file (sorry!) 
  Naming: you must use your paper ID as your file name ( | .[ppt,pptx,pdf], e.g., LCTES-paper43.pptx) 
  Location: please use this link: | https://www.dropbox.com/request/xp2Z2934nxRH0LQXm8RC 
  This requirement gives you assurance that if some major technical problem were to arise (such as a failure of your laptop), you will still be able to give your talk. If you do not make your presentation available in advance, and significant technical problems arise, we may have to shorten your presentation to keep to our tight schedule.  
 The requirement for you to use pdf or powerpoint for your backup copy is a pragmatic tradeoff. These slides will only be used in case of a technical emergency. We want to have the highest possible assurance that they will work without fuss on a third party device should such an emergency occur. If you use Google slides, Keynote, or some other software, please use the export feature to create either powerpoint or pdf backups.  
 If you elect not to upload a backup copy, please understand that this limits our volunteers’ capacity to assist you if a technical problem arises when you give your presentation.  
 Advice   
 There are many excellent sources of advice on giving good talks, including from Simon Peyton Jones  , Michael Hicks  , Michael Ernst  , and Derek Dreyer  . Make good use of these!  
 Q&A   
 If you stick to the above schedule you will have about 3 minutes for questions. The in-room audience will be able to ask questions via a queue at a single microphone on a mic stand in the center of the room.  
 It is good practice, as the speaker, to repeat your understanding of the question before providing your answer. This is particularly important when time is tight because it reduces opportunities for time being wasted on account of a misunderstanding.  
   
 Call for Papers  
   
 Call for Papers   
 Programming languages, compilers, and tools are important interfaces between embedded systems and emerging applications in the real world. Embedded systems are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, large language models, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore, they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these issues, such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints.  
 The 25th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2024) solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted to https://lctes24.hotcrp.com/  .

  Poster, work-in-progress and invited paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions. 
  Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, this year’s LCTES will have | Distinguished Paper awards | selected from this year’s accepted paper to recognise the outstanding work among all papers. 
  Special Issue Invitation   
 Accepted full papers will be invited to submit to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS)   . A TECS publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process. Papers submitted to LCTES (including the WIP papers) will be welcome to submit manuscripts to a special issue of the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (IEEE ESL)   . A 4-page IEEE ESL manuscript will require clearly distinct intellectual contribution as compared to the conference paper and will undergo a separate review process.

 Call for Papers  

 Please note that the “Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers” section has been modified a bit from previous years’.   

 PACMPL Issue PLDI 2024 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue PLDI 2024 will be invited – but not required – to present their work in the PLDI conference in June 2024, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.  
 Scope   
 PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.  
 Evaluation Criteria and Process   
 Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.  
 The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assesses the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers. Authors will have sufficient time to perform the required revisions and re-submit the paper. The same reviewers as in the first round will then assess how the revision requests have been acted upon by the authors. Revisions that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in rejection.  
 The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection, although reviews for a given paper will typically be performed by a subset of the committee. During the review period, authors must not contact Review Committee members – all questions must be addressed to the Associate Editor (who is doing the job that we would have called “Program Chair” before PLDI joined PACMPL). Contacting Review Committee members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and may be grounds for summary rejection.  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced, with extremely rare extenuating circumstances considered at the discretion of the Associate Editor.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Associate Editor. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://pldi2024.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM on Thursday November 16, 2023 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.  
 Formatting Requirements   
 Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page. Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options as well, e.g.:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}   Papers may be submmitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use author-year format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.  
 Supplementary Material   
 Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.  
 Plagiarism and Concurrent Work   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity. If you have further questions, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. At artifact submission time, authors will be asked to provide an artifact availability statement that details the expected behavior of the artifact, and how it pertains to the results of the paper. Artifact submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.  
 Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves, and include the artifact availability statement (which will not count agains the page limit). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Open Access and Copyright   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 Publication Date   
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, which ever is sooner. Note that the date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Presentations   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. We welcome all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The set of distinguished papers will be chosen through a rigorous review process of the final papers, carried out by a subset of the Review Committee.  
 Acknowledgments   
 This call-for-papers is an adaptation and evolution of content from previous SIGPLAN conferences. We are grateful to prior organizers for their work, which is reused here.  
 Code of Conduct   
 PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy  and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior  .  

 Attending  
   
 Presenter Instructions   
 In-Person Presenters   
 You should have received a Google Form entitled “PLDI’24 Presenter Questionnaire”.  
 If not, the URL is https://forms.gle/WCRJqQhEFNSybdrS8  .  
 Please fill in the questionnaire once for each talk you will give.  
 If you are presenting in-person, here are some things to keep in mind:  
 Your conference registration is mandatory  . 
  You should bring your own device  to present your slides. Please ensure your slides are available offline / accessible from a different device in case of any technical issues. 
  Your presentation device should support HDMI output  . If it does not, you are responsible for bringing the appropriate adapter. 
  You are free to choose between 4:3 aspect ratio  and 16:9 aspect ratio  , whichever makes more sense for the content of your slides. We will adapt the streaming/recording layout to your choice. Please indicate your choice in the questionnaire  . 
  Ensure your device is working and your slides are accessible during the break before your session starts  , to avoid last minute difficulties. 
  You should disable any kind of color adjustment on your computer while presenting (e.g., night shift, redshift, f.lux). If you are using a Macbook, please make sure to disable TrueTone in System Settings -> Displays. 
  Arrive at your session at least 10 minutes before it starts  . Take time to familiarize yourself with the room setup, make your presence known to the session chair, test out slides and audio, and address all issues with the student volunteer in the room. 
  You should pace your talk  carefully; time is of the essence and the program schedule will be strictly enforced. 
  You can find the length of your talk in the program  . 
  Subtract at least 5 minutes  from the allotted time to account for questions and set-up. 
  Talk slots for the main PLDI program are 20 minutes  , so presenters should aim to give a 15 minute talk  . 
  Talk slot lengths for workshops can be found on the respective workshop information pages. 
  If you do not want your talk to be either recorded or streamed, please indicate it in the questionnaire  . 
  Remote Presenters   
 Remote presentations are a little more complicated. You should double-check with your conference/workshop organizers that they are allowed in your track.  
 Please read the following instructions as they are crucial  for making sure your presentation goes as smoothly as possible!  
 Setting up Discord   
 Make sure you have a Discord account that is older than 5 minutes, with a | verified email address 
  Join the PLDI 2024 Discord server (check your email for the invite link) After joining the server, you should be prompted with a | Customisation Question | prompt. Please do the following: 
  Select the Presenter  role.    
 Go to Channels and Roles  .   
 Follow the Pre-Talk Sessions category.    
 Discord is now setup! If you have any technical issues or questions, please make sure to ask any questions in the #troubleshooting-chat  channel.   
 Pre-Session   
 On the day of your presentation, our remote volunteers will be performing several tests to make sure your presentation goes as smoothly as possible. Please join the Pre-Talk VC  channel up until 30 minutes before your scheduled presentation. There will be volunteers waiting in this channel 2 hours before the next scheduled remote presentation  . This means that if your talk is at 9 AM (Copenhagen time), there will be a volunteer in the channel from 7 AM.  
   
 If you are only joining Discord for the Q&A portion of your talk  (pre-recorded talks fall under this category), please join the Discord voice channel within the same timeline for the same tests.  
 Your Talk   
 Please join the Waiting Queue voice channel 30 minutes before your presentation.  A volunteer will promptly let you know 5 minutes before it is your time to present through the Waiting Queue chat:  
   
 When it is your time to present, the volunteer will move you to another voice channel. Here, you should be able to hear the session chair through Discord, from which you should follow their instructions for when to start presenting. When you are moved to this LIVE voice channel, please make sure to turn on your camera and screen-share  .  
 You can follow the livestream of current talks on the ACMSIGPLAN YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/@acmsigplan  .  
 If you have a pre-recorded talk  , you will still be moved to the voice channel during your talk (while your recording is playing). When your pre-recorded talk is done, you can conduct the Q&A segment by following your session chair’s instructions.  
 Troubleshooting   
 If at any point of the process there are technical issues (whether it is while presenting or during the pre-sessions) please join the Troubleshooting VC  channel under the Pre-Talk Sessions category. A volunteer will be there to assist you. If the volunteer assesses that the problem will take a considerable amount of time to solve, we will communicate with the session chair to move your talk to the next time-slot.  
 The communication between Speakers and Session Chairs will take place in the Troubleshooting VC  channel via the volunteers when technical difficulties occur.  
 Remote Presentations Summary   
 Please join the Discord voice channel titled Pre-Talk VC  within 2 hours before your talk. 
  30 minutes before your talk, join the Waiting Queue  voice channel and wait for your time-slot to commence. A volunteer will let you know 5 minutes before it is your time to present. 
  If there are any troubleshooting issues, join the Troubleshooting VC  channel and a volunteer will assist you.

 LATIN  2024  
 March 18 – 22, 2024 in Puerto Varas/Chile  

 LATIN 2024 proceedings are available for download!    

 About LATIN  
 LATIN (Latin American Theoretical Informatics) was born in 1992, when a group of Latin American researchers, under the leadership of Imre Simon (São Paulo, Brazil), launched the first of a series of symposia in theoretical computer science, to be held triennially in Latin America. Since 1998 it has been held biennially: Valparaiso, Chile (1995); Campinas, Brazil (1998); Punta del Este, Uruguay (2000); Cancún, Mexico (2002); Buenos Aires, Argentina (2004); Valdivia, Chile (2006); Búzios, Brazil (2008); Oaxaca, Mexico (2010); Arequipa, Peru (2012); Montevideo, Uruguay (2014); Ensenada, Mexico (2016); Buenos Aires, Argentina (2018); São Paulo, Brazil (2020); Guanajuato, Mexico (2022).  
   
 Scope and topics  
 LATIN 2024 is devoted to different areas in theoretical computer science including, but not limited, to:  
 algorithmic game theory 
  approximation algorithms 
  analytic combinatorics and analysis of algorithms 
  automata theory and formal languages 
  combinatorial algorithms 
  combinatorial optimization 
  combinatorics and graph theory 
  complexity theory 
  computational geometry 
  computational social choice 
  data structures 
  distributed computing 
  fixed-parameter algorithms, including FPT-approximation algorithms

 Venue  
 LATIN 2024 will take place in the beautiful city of Puerto Varas, located in the South of Chile, in the Los Rios Region. It is known for the scenic views of Osorno Volcano and Lake Llanquihue, its location near popular tourist destinations like the Vicente Perez Rosales National Park, and its German colonial architecture. Puerto Varas is a popular destination for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and skiing.  
 The conference will be hosted in the Hotel Cabaña del Lago  , located directly at the Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas. It is in walking distance (approximately 15min) to the center of Puerto Varas.  
   
 Important dates  
 Paper submission (extended): 9 October 2023 (anywhere on earth)  
 Author notification: 20 December 2023  
 Camera-ready: 8 January 2024  
 LATIN Symposium: 18 to 22 March 2024  
   
 Submissions  
 Submissions are limited to fifteen (15) single-column letter-size pages in Springer LNCS format (see LNCS author guidelines at http://www.springer.com/la/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  ). This page limit includes figures and references, but it does not include an optional appendix. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in the appendix, which will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.  
 The conference employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, references should not be omitted or anonymized.  
 Papers should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system at  
 https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=latin2024   
 Simultaneous submission of papers to any other conference with published proceedings, as well as the submission of previously published papers, is not allowed. Papers must be written in English. For each accepted paper at least one author must register and attend the symposium (in person) to present it. Moreover, an author cannot register for multiple papers. That is, each accepted paper must have its own registrant.  
 The submission form on easychair provides an opportunity to specify conflicts of interest with any of the PC members. If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest beyond the PC members, or any other issues related to the fair treatment of your submission, please contact one of the PC chairs, Jose Soto  and Andreas Wiese,  or the SafeToC representative for LATIN 2024, Andrea Richa  .  

 Registrations are open  
   
 There are full and reduced (i.e., discounted) registrations. The reduced registration is reserved only for master students and PhD students. Please note that each accepted paper requires one full  registration  (even if the presenter is a student).   
  Students may also apply for a small stipend to help covering local expenses, using this Google Form.

 Local information  
 Getting to Puerto Varas    
 Puerto Varas can be reached by plane to the Puerto Montt airport  . From there, you can take a shared shuttle (around 10,000 CLP) or a taxi (around 20,000 CLP) to Puerto Varas  . The trip takes around 30min.  
 The airlines flying to Puerto Montt are LATAM and the low-cost airlines Sky and JetSmart. When you fly to Puerto Montt from abroad, it could be an option to first fly to Santiago and then on a separate ticket from Santiago to Puerto Montt. If you do that, make sure to allow for some time at Santiago airport to do customs and pick up your luggage.  
 Hotels  
 The conference hotel is the Hotel Cabaña del Lago  . Since Puerto Varas is a popular tourist destination, there are many other hotels in the city (in different price ranges). The center of Puerto Varas and many hotels are within walking distance of the conference venue. We recommend you to book a hotel in this area.  
 Time zone  
 In March, Puerto Varas (and most of Chile in fact) observes Chile Summer Time (CLST), i.e., UTC-03:00.  
 Money  
 Credit cards are widely accepted in Puerto Varas. The local currency is the Chilean peso.  
 Electricity  
 The most common sockets in Chile are type C and L  . Note that the (European) type F plugs do not fit in such sockets. The standard voltage is 220 V, and the standard frequency is 50 Hz.  
 Tipping  
 It is standard to tip 10% in restaurants, cafes, and bars. Taxi drivers are not tipped in this way, but it is common to let them keep the change.  
 Tap water  
 The tap water is safe to drink.  
 Language  
 The official language is Spanish. Outside of touristic areas, it can be difficult to communicate in English.
