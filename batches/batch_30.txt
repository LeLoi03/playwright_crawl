 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 The purpose of the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the theory and applications in the areas of Agents and Artificial Intelligence, covering both applications and current research work. On one side it focuses on Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Software Platforms, and also Distributed Problem Solving. On the other side it focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Planning, Learning, Scheduling, Perception. Applications are in both areas. They are using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Legal Technologies and Quantum Computing.  
   
  The last four years the research emphasis has shifted towards Explainable AI and Interpretable AI with a focus on trustworthiness, fairness, privacy, safety, security and ethical issues. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications.

   About ICA3PP 2024  
   
 ICA3PP 2024 is the 24  th   in this series of conferences started in 1995 that are devoted to algorithms and architectures for parallel processing. ICA3PP is a famous event worldwide that covers many dimensions of parallel algorithms and architectures, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental projects, and commercial components and systems. With the booming computing demands from every aspect of modern society, parallel processing has become increasingly critical and challenging. This conference provides a forum for academics and practitioners from all over the world to exchange ideas on improving the efficiency, performance, reliability, security and interoperability of computing systems and applications.    
  
   Following the traditions of previous successful ICA3PP conferences held in Copenhagen, Brisbane, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Hangzhou, Cyprus, Taipei, Busan, Melbourne, Fukuoka, Vietri sul Mare, Dalian, Zhangjiajie, Granada, Helsinki, Guangzhou, New York City, Xiamen and Tianjin, ICA3PP 2024 will be held in Macao SAR, China. The objective of ICA3PP 2024 is to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and governments to advance the theories and technologies in parallel and distributed computing. ICA3PP 2024 will focus on two broad areas of parallel and distributed computing, i.e. architectures, algorithms and networks, and systems and applications. In this year, ICA3PP 2024 will be organized by City University of Macau.

 Knowledge Discovery (KD) is an interdisciplinary domain focusing upon methodologies for identifying valid, hidden, novel, potentially useful and meaningful information from within data of all kinds. Knowledge discovery encompasses an end-to-end process involving: data preparation, the application of learning techniques and the presentation of the acquired knowledge. The learning techniques used range from statistically-based data mining, through sophisticated machine learning to deep learning facilitated but recent increases in computer processing power. Current trends in the field of KD include Explainable AI, Hybrid-learning, and the application of knowledge discovery to ever increasingly diverse data sets. Information Retrieval (IR), in turn, is concerned with the gathering of relevant information, from unstructured and semantically fuzzy data in texts and other media, typically in response to a user query. This encompasses searching for information within documents and for metadata about documents, as well as searching relational databases and the Web. Automation of IR enables the reduction of what has been called "information overload". The tools and techniques of KD are increasingly used to enhance and automate information retrieval processes. Current trends in IR include learning to rank models, data representation using embedding techniques, and the use of knowledge graph technology. The scope of the KDIR conference covers all aspect KD and IR, and the overlap between the two.

 6th International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems - ACSOS 2025  
   
 We are happy to announce that the fifth edition of the International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) will take place in Tokyo, Japan from September 29th to October 03rd, 2025.  
 The International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is the leading forum to share the latest research results, ideas and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization. Now in its 6th edition, ACSOS was founded in 2020 as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO).  
 The world is increasingly embracing autonomous systems: in robotics, manufacturing, software engineering, vehicles, data center systems, and precision agriculture to name just a few areas. These systems are bringing autonomy to a whole new level of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, requiring autonomic behavior (e.g., control theory, cybernetics) and self-reference, leading to a range of self-* properties (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptation, self-organization), and an approach in which system implementation and its environment are holistically considered.

 The 6th International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is the leading forum for sharing the latest research results, ideas, and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation, and self-organization. Now in its 6th edition, ACSOS was founded in 2020 as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO).  
 The world is increasingly relying on autonomous systems: in robotics, manufacturing, software engineering, vehicles, data center systems, and precision agriculture, to name just a few areas. These systems are bringing autonomy to a whole new level of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, requiring autonomic behavior (e.g., control theory, cybernetics) and self-reference, leading to a range of self-* properties (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptation, self-organization), and an approach in which system implementation and its environment are holistically considered.  
 Despite this rise in autonomic and self-* systems, there remains a wide range of fundamental challenges in understanding how to design, control, reason about, and trust such systems. The ACSOS conference solicits novel research on these topics in fundamentals and methods as well as applications for autonomic and self-* systems. ACSOS is particularly proud of its long-standing academic breadth and innovative industry contributions and regularly features work from computational biologists through to operating systems researchers – united by the common theme of autonomous systems. The conference program will include research papers, in-practice experience reports, posters, demos, and a doctoral symposium. ACSOS 2024 solicits contributions from among (but not limited to) the following autonomic, self-adaptive and self-organizing theories, methods, and applications:  
 Theories   
 Heuristics 
  Optimization and configuration algorithms 
  Models for complex and adaptive systems 
  Methods   
 Support for adaptive systems | monitoring 
  analyzing 
  planing 
  execution 
  Specification of adaptation in | processes for development, 
  deployment 
  runtime 
  System support for adaptive systems | Operating systems 
  Middleware 
  Communication 
  Distributed learning (e.g., federated learning) 
  Applications   
 Software support for adaptive systems | Patterns in monitoring, analyzing, planning, execution 
  Software architectures 
  Languages for adaptive 
  Experiences and domains | Applications of self-organization in specific use cases 
  Insights of applying and evaluating real-world self-organizing systems | generic platforms, i.e., middleware, operating systems 
  specific applications 
  LLMs for self-adaptive and self-organizing systems (e.g., multi-robot planning) 
  Please note that this list is non-exhaustive. ACSOS strives to be a home for research in adaptive and self-organizing systems.

 6th International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems - ACSOS 2025  
   
 We are happy to announce that the fifth edition of the International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) will take place in Tokyo, Japan from September 29th to October 03rd, 2025.  
 The International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is the leading forum to share the latest research results, ideas and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization. Now in its 6th edition, ACSOS was founded in 2020 as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO).  
 The world is increasingly embracing autonomous systems: in robotics, manufacturing, software engineering, vehicles, data center systems, and precision agriculture to name just a few areas. These systems are bringing autonomy to a whole new level of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, requiring autonomic behavior (e.g., control theory, cybernetics) and self-reference, leading to a range of self-* properties (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptation, self-organization), and an approach in which system implementation and its environment are holistically considered.

  SCOPE  
 The purpose of the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the theory and applications in the areas of Agents and Artificial Intelligence, covering both applications and current research work. On one side it focuses on Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Software Platforms, and also Distributed Problem Solving. On the other side it focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Planning, Learning, Scheduling, Perception. Applications are in both areas. They are using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Legal Technologies and Quantum Computing.  
   
  The last four years the research emphasis has shifted towards Explainable AI and Interpretable AI with a focus on trustworthiness, fairness, privacy, safety, security and ethical issues. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications.  

  Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICAART with an ISBN. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions.  

  Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial, workshop or special session are invited to contact the conference secretariat or visit the conference website.

 Call for Bids to Host ACSOS  
 The steering committee of the International Conference on Autonomic and Self-Organising Systems (ACSOS) solicits bids to host future editions of the conference. The main website of the conference series can be found at https://acsos.org/  , and the 2023 and 2024 editions, held in Toronto, Canada, and Aarhus, Denmark, respectively, are available at https://2023.acsos.org/  and https://2024.acsos.org/  .  
 We are currently inviting bids for hosting the 2025, 2026, and 2027 editions of the conference!  
 Bids to Host ACSOS 2025  
 Bids for hosting the 2025 edition should be submitted by 30th April 2024. Bids should be submitted via email to the Steering Committee Co-Chairs, Peter Lewis  and Ada Diaconescu  . You are also welcome and encouraged to email the Co-Chairs for an informal discussion prior to submitting your bid.  
 Bids are eligible if they are made by individuals or small groups from the ACSOS research community. On request, the main organisers must be able to supply evidence of support from their employer (e.g., a university), especially if that employer will also act as the hosting institution. Bids from meeting professionals will not be considered.  
 About ACSOS  
 The IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) is the leading forum to share the latest research results, ideas and experiences in autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization.  
 The world is increasingly embracing autonomous systems: in robotics, manufacturing, software engineering, vehicles, data center systems, and precision agriculture to name just a few areas. These systems are bringing autonomy to a whole new level of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty, requiring autonomic behavior (e.g., control theory, cybernetics) and self-reference, leading to a range of self-* properties (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptation, self-organization), and an approach in which system implementation and its environment are holistically considered.  
 ACSOS is particularly proud of its long-standing academic breadth and innovative industry contributions, and regularly features work from computational biologists through to operating systems researchers – united by the common theme of autonomous systems.  
 Now in its 5th edition, ACSOS was founded in 2020 as a merger of the IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO). As a community, we are proud of our more than 15-year history of being a welcoming, open-minded, interdisciplinary, and scientifically rigorous research community.  
 ACSOS traditionally encompasses a 5-day programme and usually takes place in late September/early October. Two days are typically reserved for a lively workshop program, as well as and tutorials and other satellite events. At least 4 parallel sessions need to be accommodated on these days. The main conference is typically held in single-track format, to allow the whole community to share and explore diverse ideas. ACSOS typically also includes keynotes, panels, a Doctoral Symposium, the ‘ACSOS In Practice’ track, Artefact track, as well as posters and demos. Additional facilities might be required as exhibition spaces for sponsors.  
 With regard to social events, it is traditional to have a Welcome Reception as well as a conference banquet. The organisers of past events have always succeeded in giving these events a local cultural flair!  
 We encourage proposals to be brief but include at least the following information:  
 Proposed location including a short summary of why this would be a great location for the ACSOS conference 
  Initial Local Organisation Committee along with the affiliation, position, and coordinates of the primary contact person that will be available for clarifications of the bid and past experience of conference organisation 
  Venue for the conference, including the estimated cost of hosting the conference under the constraints described above 
  The suggested dates for the conferences, possibly with alternatives 
  Information about logistics such as flight and train connections (with prices from major transportation hubs), available accommodations (hotels, student housing, etc.) and their price points, expected weather at the time of the conference, other large events taking place in the area at the same time 
  Potential for local sponsorship from both the public and the private sector 
  Rough budget estimates including break-even points in number of registrants as well as an estimated registration fee 
  Potential co-located events 
  Please state all budget items consistently in either US Dollars or Euros.  
 The ACSOS Steering Committee will jointly evaluate the bids with a particular focus on the following criteria:  
 Experience of the organisers and prominence in the community 
  Support of the event by public and private local organisations and the host institution 
  Expected affordability of the event for researchers from around the world 
  Adequacy of the facilities for the conference itself as well as adequacy of accommodations in close proximity of the conference 
  Attractiveness (including travel convenience) of the host city and the surrounding area 
  Adequacy of the estimated budget 
  Distance to previous conference locations 
  We look forward to receiving your bid to host our research community!

  Innovative applications in AI and Law 
  Philosophical and legal-theoretical analysis of the significance and implications of methodologies or technical features of AI systems (particularly in applications to Law) with respect to fundamental legal concepts and ethical issues. 
  Systems and methods designed for compliance checking with respect to normative principles, rules and standards (legal or ethical) 
  Methodologies for the technical design in AI systems of compliance with normative principles, rules and standards of trustworthy or responsible AI 
  Explainable AI for the legal domain 
  Formal and computational models of legal reasoning (e.g., argumentation, case-based reasoning), including deontic logics 
  Formal and conceptual modeling of fundamental legal concepts 
  Formal and computational models of evidential reasoning 
  Formal models of norms and norm-governed systems 
  Information extraction from legal databases and texts 
  Information retrieval, question answering, and literature recommendation in the legal domain 
  Intelligent legal tutoring systems 
  Intelligent support systems for forensics 
  Interdisciplinary applications of legal informatics methods and systems 
  Knowledge acquisition techniques for the legal domain, including related applications of natural language processing, argument, and data mining 
  Knowledge representation, knowledge engineering, and ontologies in the legal domain 
  Legal design involving AI techniques 
  Machine learning and data analytics applied to the legal domain 
  Natural language processing of legal text, including law-specific standard NLP tasks (e.g., Named Entity Recognition, Semantic Role Labeling, Translation, etc.) 
  Applications of generative AI systems (LLMs) to the legal domain in connection to machine learning systems or knowledge representation systems 
  Normative reasoning by autonomous agents 
  Open and linked data in the legal domain 
  Smart contracts and application of blockchain in the legal domain 
  Visualization techniques for legal information and data 

 Papers (up to 10 pages including references for long papers, up to 5 pages including references for short papers) should present contributions from relevant topics. To maintain ICAIL’s relevance in the larger rapidly-moving field at the intersection of law and artificial intelligence, all papers must make clear their relation to legal information, reasoning, or processes. There should be a statement about the novel scientific contribution. The relation to prior work must be well-developed. The paper ought to report a full and satisfying discussion of its findings.   
 Papers on generative AI, machine learning or data mining should include discussions of the data, methodology, results, and analysis in sufficient depth beyond merely reporting metrics. 
  Submissions focusing on the reproduction, validation, constructive scrutinization, and extension of previously published works, datasets, and benchmarks are strongly encouraged. 
  Papers proposing formal or computational models should provide examples and/or reproducible simulations. 
  Papers on applications should describe the motivations, techniques, implementation, and evaluation. 
  All papers should include some discussion about the relevance to legal theory, practice, use of legal information, or impact on processes.

  All papers should include some discussion about the relevance to legal theory, practice, use of legal information, or impact on processes. 
  It is highly recommended that code and data be published alongside the papers for all submissions to facilitate reproducibility. Program committee members will be instructed to take data and code sharing into account in their reviews.   
 Paper must formatted using the ACM sigconf template (for LaTeX) or the interim template layout.docx (for Word), both at  http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template   All papers should be converted to PDF prior to electronic submission. Papers that do not adhere to these conditions will be rejected without review.   
 Submissions should be uploaded to the conference support system (to be supplied soon) by the submission deadline.   
 Reviewing will be double-blind. Papers submitted for review must not include names and affiliations of the authors and not include an acknowledgments section. Any identifying text in the body of the paper (e.g. citing “our work”) should be removed or rephrased to be non-identifying. These aspects can be added at the camera-ready stage. Therefore, prior to submission of the paper, the authors should first register the paper on the conference support system in order to receive an ID number for the paper. Then, in order to submit the paper, the paper should be revised so that the ID number of the paper replaces the names and affiliations of the authors. The references should include published literature relevant to the paper, including previous works of the authors, though care should be taken in the style of writing in order to preserve anonymity. References to code and data intended to be published alongside the papers are to be phrased such that anonymity is preserved.   
 Submitted papers may not be published as open access preprints before acceptance notifications have been sent. Papers that have already been published as preprints at the time of submission for review must be flagged as such in the review system and must not reference the preprint in the paper.   
 Papers submitted not adhering to the page limitation or the anonymity requirements may be rejected without review.   

 Calls For Workshops  

 ICAIL 2025 will include workshops and tutorials on Monday, June the 16th and Friday, June the 20th. Tutorials should cover a broad topic of relevance to the AI and Law community and should have one or more designated organizers/speakers. Workshops are intended for informal discussion and should have one or more designated organizers as well as an organizing and programming committee. Proposals must contain enough information to permit evaluation on the basis of importance, quality, and community interest. Proposals should be 2 to 4 pages and include at least the following information:   
 The workshop or tutorial topic and goals, their significance, and their appropriateness for ICAIL 2025 
  The intended audience, including the research areas from which participants may come, the likely number of participants (with some of their names, if known), and plans for publicizing the workshop 
  Organization of the workshop or tutorial, including the intended format (such as invited talks, presentations, panel discussions, or other methods for ensuring an interactive atmosphere) and the expected length (full day or half day) 
  Organizers’ details: a description of the main organizers’ background in the proposed topic; and complete addresses including web pages of all organizers and committee members (if applicable) 
  Proposals for workshops and tutorials must be submitted in a filling form (to be supplied soon), by the submission deadline.   

 Calls For Demonstrations  

 A session will be organized for the demonstration of creative, robust, and practical working applications and tools.  Where a demonstration is not connected to a submitted paper, a two-page extended abstract about the system should be submitted for review  ,  via the conference support system and following the instructions on paper submission. Accepted extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings. For those demonstrations that are connected to a submitted paper, no separate statement about the demonstration needs to be submitted, but the author(s) should send an email to the Program Chair by the demo submission deadline to register their interest in demonstrating their work at this session.

 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 Publication chance based on affiliation  
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference.  
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.  

 Research.com  

 During the most recent 2017 edition, 7.89%  of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations, 52.14%  were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another 8.57%  included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included 17.86%  of all publications and 21.43%  were from other institutions.  
 Returning Authors Index  
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year.  
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index  
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index  
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at the last edition of a conference  , grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C).  
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 

 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.

 EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP)  
 ICALP joined SafeToC http://safetoc.org/  (code of conduct here  )  
 The International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP) is the flagship conference and annual meeting of the EATCS. The conference was launched in 1972 and covers all aspects of theoretical computer science. ICALP customarily takes place during the second or third week of July.  
 ICALP’s scientific program is split into two parts: Track A of the meeting corresponds to Algorithms, Complexity, and Games, and Track B to Automata, Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming. Typical topics are: algorithmic aspects of network economics, approximation and online algorithms, automata theory, combinatorial optimisation, computational complexity, design and analysis of algorithms, formal aspects of security, foundations of databases, games and logic, logic and semantics of programs, mathematical aspects of programming, models of concurrent, reactive and stochastic systems, networked computation, parallel and distributed computing, quantum computing, randomness in computing, type systems, verification and synthesis.  
 EATCS presents annually the Best EATCS Paper Award  , the Best Student  and best ICALP Paper  Awards, all awarded at ICALP. Jointly with ACM SIGLOG, EACSL and the Kurt Goedel Society, EATCS presents the Alonzo Church award. Jointly with ACM SIGACT, EATCS awards the Gödel Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science. The award ceremony takes place alternately at ICALP and STOC.  
 The proceedings of ICALP are published since 2015 in the open-access series Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik (LIPIcs) and are available at https://dblp.org/db/conf/icalp/index.html  .

 About ICAISC 2025  
 The 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing ICAISC 2025 will be held in Zakopane (situated in the High Tatra mountains), Poland in June 22-26, 2025 in Bachleda Kasprowy Zakopane Hotel  . The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for scientists and engineers to present and discuss the latest scientific results and methods. The conference will include keynote addresses, contributed papers, and numerous lectures and tutorials on a wide range of topics. The Conference will be held in the hybrid mode: online and on-site in Zakopane  . The authors of accepted papers will have a choice to present their papers on-line, or on site in Zakopane, Mercury Kasprowy Hotel, Poland. All accepted papers, irrespective of the presentation mode, will be included in the LNAI conference proceedings.  
 The working language of the conference is English. Only original, unpublished papers are invited. Authors should submit an electronic version of papers by the conference web page. The papers should be organized in accordance with a common scientific structure (abstract, state of the art in the field, intention, used methodology, obtained results and references). Papers will undergo double-blind reviewing by an international committee, and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit and relevance to the conference topics. Please prepare anonymized versions of the paper being submitted. Please preserve anonymity by avoiding providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements, links to websites and the literature references. After the notification of acceptance, authors will be allowed to make a correction in accordance with the suggestions of the reviewers and submit final camera-ready papers in Latex format only. The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Springer LNAI proceedings will be available online shortly after the conference. Accepted papers must be presented by the author(s) personally to be published in the conference proceedings.  
 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 Venue  
 The conference is organized in Poland's premier mountain resort Zakopane, the beautiful and picturesque capital of the Polish High Tatra Mountains. Even though Zakopane is called Poland's winter capital, it is an excellent place to visit in spring. Situated at the foot of the Tatra Mountains and the Tatra National Park (with Poland's highest peak, Rysy mountain (2499m)), it offers you a chance to hike on over 240km of marked hiking trails for beginners as well as experienced climbers and explore caves (accessible only in summer). The town boasts many historic monuments, museums, art galleries and exhibitions. On your way to Zakopane you may visit Cracow, one of the most historic Polish cities, with a wonderfully preserved old city center and the largest medieval square in Europe.

 From Cracow to Zakopane  From Balice Airport in Cracow you have to get to the Cracow PKP Railway Station area to take a bus to Zakopane. To do so you can:  
 call a taxi (phone numbers e.g. 9661 or 9622 in Cracow) cost apr 40 PLN, 
  or take a bus number 192 or 208 (ticket is less than 3 PLN). 
   
 When you arrive in Cracow you do not need to book a bus to Zakopane as there are frequent shuttle buses to Zakopane, which leave apr. every 40 min. from the area of the PKP Railway Station. The Cracow-Zakopane line is serviced by Szwagropol, trans-Frej and PKS companies. The ticket costs apr. 10 PLN. Alternatively you can use a train but the train is slower ( Polish State Railways Time-table  ).  
   
 How to reach ICAISC from Zakopane  
 Participants who arrive in Zakopane are advised to take a private mini-bus (or a taxi) in the direction to Bachleda Kasprowy Zakopane Hotel. The cost of taxi is apr. 30PLN. You can call a taxi from a payphone (phone number in Zakopane: 919 or (+48)(20) 66666).

 Beware of the Fake ICAISC Conference from WASET  
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

 Future ICALPs  
 The International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP) is the main conference and annual meeting of the EATCS. This international conference was launched in 1972 and covers all aspects of theoretical computer science. ICALP customarily takes place during the second or third week of July.  
 Traditionally ICALP’s scientific program is split into two parts: Track A of the meeting corresponds to Algorithms, Complexity, and Games, and Track B to Automata, Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming. Since 2009, Track C is available on Foundations of Networks and multi-agent systems: Models, Algorithms and Information Management.  
 Typical topics discussed during recent ICALP conferences are: automata theory, computational complexity, computational geometry, computability, cryptography, data types and data structures, design and analysis of algorithms, foundations of databases, games and logic, logic programming, logic and semantics of programs, mathematical aspects of programming, models of concurrency, networked computation, parallel and distributed computing, quantum computing, type systems, theorem proving, verification and synthesis.  
 EATCS presents annually the Best EATCS Paper Award  , the Best Student  and best ICALP Paper  Awards, all awarded at ICALP. Jointly with ACM SIGACT, EATCS awards annually the Gödel Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science. The award ceremony takes place alternately at ICALP and STOC (ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing).

 The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling  (ICAPS) is the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology.  
 ICAPS 2025  is the 35th edition of the ICAPS conference series and will take place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in November 2025. The conference will be co-located with the following events:  
 KR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. 
  CPAIOR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research. 
  Planning and Optimisation Summer School 2025 | , the details of which will be announced here at a future date. 
  The organisers of ICAPS 2025 invite technical paper submissions  from researchers and industrial practitioners, on all aspects of automated planning and scheduling technology. Relevant contributions include, but are not limited to:  
 Theoretical and empirical studies of planning and scheduling problems and algorithms; 
  Novel techniques and approaches that extend the scope and scale of problems that can be solved; 
  Novel tools and frameworks for analysing and verifying the properties of systems executing plans, policies or schedules; 
  Studies of applying automated planning and scheduling technologies to significant problems with deep technical insight. 
  The following video has been prepared by the Program Committee to walk interested parties through the major changes in the organisation of the conference with respect to previous editions:

 Call for Tools Papers  
 The ICAPS 2025 Program Committee have introduced a new type of submission that follows the example of conferences such as TACAS  and CAV  to encourage and reward with visibility community efforts towards developing, maintaining and extending publicly available tools that enable and facilitate research into planning and scheduling.  
 It is common place that submissions to ICAPS include a brief section discussing implementation and engineering issues. The purpose of introducing a specific type of submissions with slightly different instructions to the rest is to put into focus the engineering issues in a self-contained and autonomous fashion, separate from contributions that focus on algorithms, theory or representations.  
 Doing so provides useful context to evaluate novelty of submissions. The subject of Tools papers can be refinements or optimizations of existing algorithms or techniques. Therefore, these submissions may not be novel from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but may well be so from an engineering perspective and have wide-ranging, long-standing impact.  
 For instance, the “two-literal watch rule” was not a significant innovation from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but its introduction along with other important techniques, had profound impacts in the applications and direction of research in Boolean Satisfiability.  
 Specific Instructions for Tools Papers  
 Submissions must describe tools of broad interest and utility to the ICAPS community.  
 Tools papers are required to provide an “artifact” along with a paper (either long or short) whose format and content satisfies the requirements given in the Call for Papers  . Arfifacts are defined as additional material (software, data sets, etc.) that substantiates claims made in the paper and renders them fully replicable  . An artifact may for instance consist of a tool and its accompanying documentation, the input files used for the evaluation of the tool in the paper, and configuration files or other documents that describe the parameters used in the experiments.  
 Papers in this category must clearly describe the problem to be solved, its importance, related work, the techniques used in the tool and their novelty, the construction of the tool, its unique features, a discussion of how the tool is used and an evaluation of the usefulness of the tool along with a comparison with other tools and previous versions of the tool.  
 Reviewers are instructed to read the corresponding paper and evaluate the artifact according to the following criteria included in our instructions for reviewers  :  
 consistency with and replicability of results presented in the paper, 
  completeness, 
  documentation and ease of use, 
  availability in a permanent online repository. 
  There is no requirement of anonymising the artifact, so these submissions are de-facto single-blind  . Still, we expect that the paper submitted for review satisfy the requirements of double-blind review outlined in the Call for Papers  .  
 Artifact Submission  
 Artifacts must be submitted as part of the Supplementary Materials section in the OpenReview submission form. The following text files must be found in the ZIP archive submitted as supplementary materials:  
 an abstract (ABSTRACT) that summarises the artifact and its relation to the paper, 
  a license document (LICENSE) for the artifact that must, at the very least, allow the assigned PC members to evaluate the artifact, 
  an instructions document (README) that includes: | a hyperlink to the artifact (not the binary or source code of the artifact), 
  a script to install and configure the artifact (e.g. Docker file or similar), 
  detailed instructions that enable the PC to quickly verify that the artifact is running properly, 
  detailed instructions for using the artifact to replicate the results in the paper, including estimated resources if these are non-trivial. 
  We recommend the use of Markdown  to format these text files. We recommend that artifacts are configured for broad availability: Ubuntu 22.04 or better, Windows and MacOs. Broad availability is one of the criteria for evaluating submissions.  
 The artifact hyperlink must point to a service or repository that allows interaction with or downloading the artifact in a completely anonymous fashion  . Failure to do so, or active attempts to identify the PC members reviewing the artifact, will lead to summary desk rejection  .

 Call for Tools Papers  
 The ICAPS 2025 Program Committee have introduced a new type of submission that follows the example of conferences such as TACAS  and CAV  to encourage and reward with visibility community efforts towards developing, maintaining and extending publicly available tools that enable and facilitate research into planning and scheduling.  
 It is common place that submissions to ICAPS include a brief section discussing implementation and engineering issues. The purpose of introducing a specific type of submissions with slightly different instructions to the rest is to put into focus the engineering issues in a self-contained and autonomous fashion, separate from contributions that focus on algorithms, theory or representations.  
 Doing so provides useful context to evaluate novelty of submissions. The subject of Tools papers can be refinements or optimizations of existing algorithms or techniques. Therefore, these submissions may not be novel from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but may well be so from an engineering perspective and have wide-ranging, long-standing impact.  
 For instance, the “two-literal watch rule” was not a significant innovation from a theoretical or algorithmic perspective, but its introduction along with other important techniques, had profound impacts in the applications and direction of research in Boolean Satisfiability.  
 Specific Instructions for Tools Papers  
 Submissions must describe tools of broad interest and utility to the ICAPS community.  
 Tools papers are required to provide an “artifact” along with a paper (either long or short) whose format and content satisfies the requirements given in the Call for Papers  . Arfifacts are defined as additional material (software, data sets, etc.) that substantiates claims made in the paper and renders them fully replicable  . An artifact may for instance consist of a tool and its accompanying documentation, the input files used for the evaluation of the tool in the paper, and configuration files or other documents that describe the parameters used in the experiments.  
 Papers in this category must clearly describe the problem to be solved, its importance, related work, the techniques used in the tool and their novelty, the construction of the tool, its unique features, a discussion of how the tool is used and an evaluation of the usefulness of the tool along with a comparison with other tools and previous versions of the tool.  
 Reviewers are instructed to read the corresponding paper and evaluate the artifact according to the following criteria included in our instructions for reviewers  :  
 consistency with and replicability of results presented in the paper, 
  completeness, 
  documentation and ease of use, 
  availability in a permanent online repository. 
  There is no requirement of anonymising the artifact, so these submissions are de-facto single-blind  . Still, we expect that the paper submitted for review satisfy the requirements of double-blind review outlined in the Call for Papers  .  
 Artifact Submission  
 Artifacts must be submitted as part of the Supplementary Materials section in the OpenReview submission form. The following text files must be found in the ZIP archive submitted as supplementary materials:  
 an abstract (ABSTRACT) that summarises the artifact and its relation to the paper, 
  a license document (LICENSE) for the artifact that must, at the very least, allow the assigned PC members to evaluate the artifact, 
  an instructions document (README) that includes: | a hyperlink to the artifact (not the binary or source code of the artifact), 
  a script to install and configure the artifact (e.g. Docker file or similar), 
  detailed instructions that enable the PC to quickly verify that the artifact is running properly, 
  detailed instructions for using the artifact to replicate the results in the paper, including estimated resources if these are non-trivial. 
  We recommend the use of Markdown  to format these text files. We recommend that artifacts are configured for broad availability: Ubuntu 22.04 or better, Windows and MacOs. Broad availability is one of the criteria for evaluating submissions.  
 The artifact hyperlink must point to a service or repository that allows interaction with or downloading the artifact in a completely anonymous fashion  . Failure to do so, or active attempts to identify the PC members reviewing the artifact, will lead to summary desk rejection  .

 “Planning is the art and practice of thinking before acting.”  
 P@trik Haslum   
  The primary objectives of ICAPS are to further the field of automated planning and scheduling through the organization of technical meetings, including the annual ICAPS conference, through the organization of summer schools, tutorials and training activities at various events, through the organization of planning and scheduling competitions, benchmarking and other means of advancing and assessing the state of the art in the field, by promoting the involvement of young scientists in the field through scholarships and other means, and by promoting and disseminating publications, planning and scheduling systems, domains, simulators, software tools and technical material.  
  
 “Probably the biggest problem I had was I didn’t understand the importance of scheduling.”  
 Anne Donovan   
    ICAPS’s greatest strengths come from the people who make up our community. ICAPS is committed to fostering an inclusive community with opportunities for all participants without regard to age, religion, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability. We strive to remove barriers and obstacles that limit participation, and we work to uncover biases that create unfair practices. Every ICAPS participant is encouraged to engage in civil discourse when opinions and points of view differ. We value and respect one another, and we will hold one another accountable when we falter. Differences are welcomed and celebrated. Join us.

  Call For Papers   
   
 The 20th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems hopes to bring together researchers and practitioners in computer systems to engage in a lively discussion on the principles and practices of building systems software. Continuing the HotOS tradition, participants will present new ideas and debate future research agendas in systems research. We solicit position papers that propose new directions of systems research, advocate innovative approaches to long-standing problems, or report on deep insights gained from experience with real-world systems. We seek early-stage work where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry that results in multiple conference papers by different authors in related venues, rather than a single follow-on conference paper. The program committee will explicitly favor papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion. HotOS takes a broad view of systems research. This includes operating systems, storage, distributed systems, mobile and embedded systems, virtualization, programming languages, networking, security, dependability, and manageability, as well as new systems contributions influenced by other fields such as hardware design, training and serving machine learning, verification, economics, social organization, and biological or other nontraditional computing systems. Research and position paper submissions must be no longer than 5 pages including figures and tables, plus as many pages as needed for references. Text should be formatted according to ACM's formatting conventions with 10-point font (two columns, 8.5x11-inch paper, 10-point Times Roman or Libertine font on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, 0.75-inch margins, 0.33-inch gutter [column separation]). Paper submissions will be double blind. The title and an abstract should appear on the first page; authors should not. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). Pages should be numbered. Figures and tables should not require magnification for viewing; they may contain color, but should be legible when printed or displayed in black and white. Submissions not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. Please use the acmart style (\documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}). HotOS XX will also feature panels and events with the aim of inspiring lively discussion and research direction-setting independent of any specific work. Panels and events may have many formats, from conventional panel discussions to breakouts to games. If you are interested in hosting or proposing an event, please submit a 1-page proposal (using the same format as above) describing topic, format, and length (up to 90 minutes), plus as many pages as necessary for references and supporting letters from planned participants. Unlike papers, panel and event proposals need not be anonymous (i.e., they may be single blind). Proposals will be evaluated based on relevance of topic and potential to engage the audience. We especially encourage panel topics including but not limited to: industry perspectives on systems research; diversity and inclusion in systems research; under-appreciated open source technologies; and hardware trends and their implications for the future of systems research. Research and position papers as well as panel proposals must be received by Thursday January 15, AoE. This is a hard deadline. Papers and proposals should be submitted as PDF files via the web submission form. Please select your submission type on the form (paper or proposal). Revised versions of all accepted papers will be available online to registered attendees before the workshop. After the workshop, accepted papers will be made available on the workshop site, along with slides of the presentation and in some cases a summary of the discussion. Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for any accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has recently committed to collecting ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. HotOS will be an in-person workshop, and we expect at least one author of each accepted paper to present it and participate in the discussion. In extreme cases (in particular, if authors are unable to obtain a visa) we may consider alternatives, but please contact the chairs if you anticipate any problems attending. In order to encourage deeper discussion and interactions, registration for HotOS will be limited. We expect at least two authors per accepted paper will receive invitations to attend if desired. For non-authors, especially students and industry practitioners, there will be a registration process to request an invitation (to be announced closer to the event). Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. ACM, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the ACM plagiarism policy and procedures for details. Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is permitted. However, your HotOS submission must use an anonymized name for your project or system that differs from any used in such contexts. Furthermore, by submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
