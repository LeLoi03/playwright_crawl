 The ACM SIGPLAN 2025 International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC 2025) is interested in work on processing programs in the most general sense: analyzing, transforming or executing input programs that describe how a system operates, including traditional compiler construction as a special case. Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest which include, but are not limited to: Compilation and interpretation techniques, including program representation, analysis, and transformation; code generation, optimization, and synthesis; the verification thereof Run-time techniques, including memory management, virtual machines, and dynamic and just-in-time compilation Programming tools, including refactoring editors, checkers, verifiers, compilers, debuggers, and profilers Techniques, ranging from programming languages to micro-architectural support, for specific domains such as secure, parallel, distributed, embedded or mobile environments Design and implementation of novel language constructs, programming models, and domain-specific languages Implications to compiler construction from emerging or non-conventional applications (e.g., deep learning, quantum computing, DNA computing, etc.) CC is an ACM SIGPLAN conference and implements guidelines and procedures recommended by SIGPLAN. Prospective authors should be aware of ACM’s Copyright policies. Proceedings will be made available online in the ACM digital library from one week before to one week after the conference.

 The 14th International Symposium on Algorithms and Complexity (CIAC 2025) is scheduled to take place from June 10 to June 12, 2025, at LUISS University, Rome, Italy.   
 Important Dates   
 Deadline for submissions: November 15, 2024  (AoE) – extended November 22, 2024 
  Author notification: January 31, 2025 
  Camera-ready due: February 14, 2025 
  Submission site:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025    
 Topics   
 Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research on algorithms and complexity. Typical areas include:   
 algorithm design and analysis 
  sequential, parallel, and distributed algorithms 
  data structures 
  computational and structural complexity 
  lower bounds and limitations of algorithms 
  randomized and approximation algorithms 
  parameterized algorithms and parameterized complexity classes 
  smoothed analysis of algorithms 
  alternatives to the worst-case analysis of algorithms (e.g., algorithms with predictions) 
  on-line computation and competitive analysis 
  streaming algorithms 
  quantum algorithms and complexity 
  algorithms in algebra, geometry, number theory and combinatorics 
  computational geometry 
  algorithmic game theory and mechanism design 
  algorithmic economics (including auctions and contests) 
  computational learning theory 
  computational biology and bioinformatics 
  algorithmic issues in communication networks 
  algorithms for discrete optimization (including convex optimization) 
  algorithm engineering 
  Paper Submission and Proceedings   
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most 15 pages, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page.   
 The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. LNCS templates are available here: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  . No changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Submissions should be anonymized according to the double-blind review policy . Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered.   
 Submissions will be through EasyChair (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025   )   
 The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion.   
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed.   
 At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered.   
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission.   
 The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv).   
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members.   
 PC Submissions   
 Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed.   
 Proceedings   
 Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As in previous editions, the proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer LNCS.  
 Best Paper Award   
 Two selected papers will receive the Best Paper Award, sponsored by Springer.   
 Contact Information   
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to Loukas Georgiadis at  loukas@uoi.gr

5. Conference CCA_3:
About the conference  
 History  
 In 1986 the first Structure in Complexity Theory Conference  was organized with the support of the US National Science Foundation. As indicated in the call for papers  , the conference focused on the global aspects of computational complexity theory and the structural properties of both complexity classes and complexity-bounded reducibilities  , and became known as Structures  . From 1987 through 2014 the conference was sponsored by the IEEE  Computer Society  Technical Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computing  . In 1996 the conference broadened its scope to the current one, and accordingly changed its name to Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity  , abbreviated as CCC  . In 2014, after a community-wide discussion  and a strong movement towards independence  based on a desire for open access to the proceedings, the Computational Complexity Foundation Inc.  was established. Starting from 2015 the Foundation organizes the conference independently under the name Computational Complexity Conference  , maintaining the acronym CCC  .  
 The list of future and past conferences  contains links to the websites for the individual years. Past programs and call for papers (going back to 1997) are also available there.  
 Scope  
 CCC aims to foster research in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. Typical models include deterministic, nondeterministic, randomized, and quantum models; uniform and nonuniform models; Boolean, algebraic, and continuous models. Typical resource constraints involve time, space, randomness program size, input queries, communication, and entanglement; worst-case as well as average case. Other, more specific, topics include: probabilistic and interactive proof systems, inapproximability, proof complexity, descriptive complexity, and complexity-theoretic aspects of cryptography and machine learning. The conference also encourages results from other areas of computer science and mathematics motivated by computational complexity theory.  
 Logistics  
 CCC is typically held sometime between mid-May and mid-July and somewhere in North America or Europe. The conference usually lasts three to three-and-a-half days with a relatively relaxed schedule. Papers are presented in a single track. There are also often invited speakers. Common evening activities include an opening reception, a rump session consisting of talks about recent breakthroughs and research in progress, and a business meeting that is open to all conference attendees.  
 Proceedings  
 Up to 2010 CCC had paper proceedings. Most of the historic proceedings are available in digital format, as indicated in the table below. Starting from 2015 the proceedings of CCC are published in the open access venue Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics  (LIPIcs).

  There are bibliographies for all conferences at the DBLP site  of the University of Trier. Awards  
 CCC has a tradition of giving a Best Student Paper Award  for the most outstanding paper written solely by one or more students. As of 2015, funding for the best student paper award is provided by the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science  (EATCS).  
 As of 2001, a Best Paper Award  is given to the most outstanding paper submitted to the conference. For each award, the program committee may decide to split the award among two or more papers, or not to present the award at all. As of 2014, based on an arrangement with the Journal of the ACM  , authors of papers that receive the Best Paper Award are invited to publish an extended version of the paper in that journal.  
 Special Journal Issues  
 Each year full versions of a small number of conference submissions are invited by the program committee to be submitted to a special issue of a journal. The submissions go through the normal journal refereeing process but will often appear sooner than if they had been submitted the usual way. From the conference's inception in 1986 to 2003 the special issue appeared in the Journal of Computer and System Sciences  (JCSS), with the exception of 1990, when it appeared in the journal Theoretical Computer Science  (TCS). From 2004 till 2015, it appeared in the journal Computational Complexity  (CC), and since 2016 in the open access journal Theory of Computing  (ToC).

  Notes on the Early History of CADE  
 The 1968 meeting was organized by the mathematician Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, one of the founders of formal language theory, the logician Daniel Lacombe and the computer scientist Louis Nolin. It occurred at the just created IRIA (Institut de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique) in Rocquencourt, near Versailles. This was actually the first scientific meeting organized at IRIA (to become INRIA in 1984 when it became a national institute). Schützenberger was the father of the Parisian school of theoretical computer science, and one of the founding scientific directors of IRIA. G. Kreisel came, probably invited by D. Lacombe, a specialist of recursive functions theory, and Jean-Louis Krivine, who had been working with him on axiomatic set theory. de Bruijn gave one of the first presentations of Automath. D. Scott discussed a notion of constructive validity. Several pioneers of automated theorem-proving participated, such as Hao Wang, R. Kowalski, D. Loveland, D. Luckham and L. Wos.  
 Peter Andrews provided many details of the early CADEs. He noted … “Evidently the conference at Versailles, France, in 1968 was not considered part of the CADE sequence of conferences by the early CADE organizers (one of whom was Wolfgang Bibel).” Gérard Huet recalls … “CADE was created probably at the 1977 meeting. Retroactively, the meetings of Argonne and Oberworlfach were christened CADE-1 and CADE-2, consistently with the fact that they were organized by the automated deduction community (Wos, Robinson, Bledsoe, Loveland, Andrews, Bibel, etc).” Wolfgang Bibel confirmed … “The term CADE was used for the very first time for CADE-1980, the Fifth International Conference on Automated Deduction (the numbering added after the reconstruction of the history), held in Les Arcs, Frankreich Juli 1980. Its Program Chairs were Wolfgang Bibel and Robert Kowalski. And it was me who suggested to introduce the term in - still existing - letters to Woody Bledsoe, Bob Kowalsky and others.”. Reiner Hähnle kindly went to the TU Darmstadt archive and took photos of some of the original correspondence between Wolfgang and Bob Kowaski which are provided here with permission from Wolfgang. They are a letter from Wolfgang to Bob dated 4/4/79  regarding the arrangements for the 1979 conference, Wolfgang’s draft CFP  for the conference, and a letter from Bob to Wolfgang dated 20/4/79  in which Bob agrees to Wolfgang’s suggestion of the CADE acronym.

 CCEM Overview  
 Conference Scope  
 The top-rated CCEM  conference series, which was introduced in 2012, is now hosting the Thirteenth (13th) IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets (CCEM)  .  
 Over the past few years, cloud computing has been a dominating and revolutionary paradigm in information technology, and it is starting to have an impact on a wide range of sectors, including government, finance, telecommunications, education, retail, energy and utilities, and transportation. The research in cloud computing has become quite active and covers a wide range of topics, such as networking, storage, security, virtualization, efficient cloud architectures, enormous multi-tenancy, cloud application and service design, and cloud service administration. With AI algorithms, evaluating massive amounts of data to create content specifically for target audiences, content production has become more dynamic and focused.  
 Cloud computing continues to remain the future with studies suggesting more than 50% of all information technology will transition to a new paradigm within the next five to ten years. AI in the media and entertainment industry has seen a rise in innovation in this area too. AI has become increasingly important in gaming, podcasts, content suggestions, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, book publishing, film production, and marketing. This transformation has great implications for emerging markets which have the potential to leapfrog mature markets in their adoption of cloud computing, combine cloud computing and mobile technologies, AI, Gen AI & Meta AI etc. to introduce unique services that can transform the lives of billions, drive a much larger scale of adoption and challenge existing price points, while presenting unique challenges in areas such as security and user interfaces to Industry 4.0.

16. Conference CCC_3:
About the conference  
 History  
 In 1986 the first Structure in Complexity Theory Conference  was organized with the support of the US National Science Foundation. As indicated in the call for papers  , the conference focused on the global aspects of computational complexity theory and the structural properties of both complexity classes and complexity-bounded reducibilities  , and became known as Structures  . From 1987 through 2014 the conference was sponsored by the IEEE  Computer Society  Technical Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computing  . In 1996 the conference broadened its scope to the current one, and accordingly changed its name to Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity  , abbreviated as CCC  . In 2014, after a community-wide discussion  and a strong movement towards independence  based on a desire for open access to the proceedings, the Computational Complexity Foundation Inc.  was established. Starting from 2015 the Foundation organizes the conference independently under the name Computational Complexity Conference  , maintaining the acronym CCC  .  
 The list of future and past conferences  contains links to the websites for the individual years. Past programs and call for papers (going back to 1997) are also available there.  
 Scope  
 CCC aims to foster research in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. Typical models include deterministic, nondeterministic, randomized, and quantum models; uniform and nonuniform models; Boolean, algebraic, and continuous models. Typical resource constraints involve time, space, randomness program size, input queries, communication, and entanglement; worst-case as well as average case. Other, more specific, topics include: probabilistic and interactive proof systems, inapproximability, proof complexity, descriptive complexity, and complexity-theoretic aspects of cryptography and machine learning. The conference also encourages results from other areas of computer science and mathematics motivated by computational complexity theory.  
 Logistics  
 CCC is typically held sometime between mid-May and mid-July and somewhere in North America or Europe. The conference usually lasts three to three-and-a-half days with a relatively relaxed schedule. Papers are presented in a single track. There are also often invited speakers. Common evening activities include an opening reception, a rump session consisting of talks about recent breakthroughs and research in progress, and a business meeting that is open to all conference attendees.  
 Proceedings  
 Up to 2010 CCC had paper proceedings. Most of the historic proceedings are available in digital format, as indicated in the table below. Starting from 2015 the proceedings of CCC are published in the open access venue Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics  (LIPIcs).

 1995 | IEEExplore  and CSDL 
 1988-1994 | IEEExplore 
 1986 | Springer LNCS 
  
  There are bibliographies for all conferences at the DBLP site  of the University of Trier. Awards  
 CCC has a tradition of giving a Best Student Paper Award  for the most outstanding paper written solely by one or more students. As of 2015, funding for the best student paper award is provided by the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science  (EATCS).  
 As of 2001, a Best Paper Award  is given to the most outstanding paper submitted to the conference. For each award, the program committee may decide to split the award among two or more papers, or not to present the award at all. As of 2014, based on an arrangement with the Journal of the ACM  , authors of papers that receive the Best Paper Award are invited to publish an extended version of the paper in that journal.  
 Special Journal Issues  
 Each year full versions of a small number of conference submissions are invited by the program committee to be submitted to a special issue of a journal. The submissions go through the normal journal refereeing process but will often appear sooner than if they had been submitted the usual way. From the conference's inception in 1986 to 2003 the special issue appeared in the Journal of Computer and System Sciences  (JCSS), with the exception of 1990, when it appeared in the journal Theoretical Computer Science  (TCS). From 2004 till 2015, it appeared in the journal Computational Complexity  (CC), and since 2016 in the open access journal Theory of Computing  (ToC).

  Call for Papers    

 The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.  
  Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

  Submission Instructions  
 Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org  for any questions regarding the submissions.  
  
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE   Paper Formatting   
 Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template (available here  ). All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:  
 Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission. 
  Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past. 
  Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years. 
  PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.  
 Anonymous Submissions   
  
 ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.  
 Double and Concurrent Submissions   
 Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.  
 Ethical Considerations   
 The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.  
 Early Rejection and Appeals   
 There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 Paper Revision and Resubmission   
 Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2. A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.  
 Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation   
 If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.  
 Contact  
 For any questions related to paper submissions, please contact the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org  .

 The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.  
  Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

  Submission Instructions  
 Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org  for any questions regarding the submissions.  
  
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE   Paper Formatting   
 Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template (available here  ). All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:  
 Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission. 
  Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past. 
  Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years. 
  PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.  
 Anonymous Submissions   
  
 ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.  
 Double and Concurrent Submissions   
 Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.  
 Ethical Considerations   
 The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.  
 Early Rejection and Appeals   
 There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 Paper Revision and Resubmission   
 Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2. A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.  
 Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation   
 If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

  Call for Papers    

 The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.  
  Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

  Submission Instructions  
 Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org  for any questions regarding the submissions.  
  
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE   Paper Formatting   
 Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template (available here  ). All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:  
 Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission. 
  Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past. 
  Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years. 
  PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.  
 Anonymous Submissions   
  
 ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.  
 Double and Concurrent Submissions   
 Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.  
 Ethical Considerations   
 The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.  
 Early Rejection and Appeals   
 There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 Paper Revision and Resubmission   
 Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2. A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.  
 Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation   
 If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

  If the terms changed, the latest online version shall prevail. 
  1. SCHOLAT Social Network [Download]   
 Community is the implicit structure in social networks. In academic social networks, the users with similar or same research interests are more likely to be in the same community with close links and similar attributes. Effective community detection results can be further utilized for user analytics and user recommendation.  
 This dataset aims to fuse user links and attributes for community detection. The dataset mainly consists of three parts where contains 16,007 users and 202,248 links. (1) "attribute" directory contains 16,007 files which are user attributes with the user IDs as file names. (2) "links.txt" contains 202,248 lines and each line means that there exists one link (friendship, team members in the same research teams, or classmates in the same courses) between two users (represented as IDs) which are split by TAB. (3) "lexicons.txt" contains 25,817 words with 15,790 Chinese words and 10,027 English words, which constitutes all the user attributes.  
 BTW, the last version of this dataset has been successfully applied for the first ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (1 st  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 15 th  Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2020). View the details on https://www.scholat.com/confweb/CCSCW2020/big_data_competiton.jsp  . The difference between this version and the last version on ChineseCSCW Cup is that we extend more user links.

 2. SCHOLAT Link Prediction [Download]   
 Link prediction is an important research problem in academic social network analysis. It mines possible relationships among scholars by using existing network structure and external information. An effective link prediction method can support many personalized applications of academic social networks, including recommendation of scholars' friends/followers, completion/prediction of scholars' collaborative relationship, and recommendation of academic resources.  
 This dataset mainly contains the user attributes and links among 10,755 users from SCHOLAT. The "attribute" directory contains 10,755 files which are user attributes with the user IDs as file names. "train.csv", "dev.csv" and "test.csv" are 168540, 16854 and 16854 undirected edges respectively with the 2-column user nodes.  
 This dataset will be used for the second ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (2 nd  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 16th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2021).

 3. Anomaly Detection on Attributed Network [Download]   
 Anomaly detection on attributed networks is an important task in social network analysis. The goal is to find the anomalies that deviate significantly from the majority of the network in terms of some proximities, e.g. topological structure or attribute proximity. An effective anomaly detection can support many applications such as web spam detection, system fraud detection, network intrusion detection and representation learning.  
 This dataset is adopted for simultaneously detecting structure/attribute-abnormal nodes and motif instances. The nodes represent the scholars and the edges denote the message interactions between the two ending nodes. The breadth first search with random restart is used to craw the nodes. And the nodes of degree no larger than 50 are preserved. The node attribute vectors are extracted by means of applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on the brief biographies of the corresponding scholars. After preprocessing and subset selection, the SCHOLAT dataset contains 2,022 nodes, 2,500 edges and 329 triangle motif instances. The dimension of the node attribute vectors is 500. The number of the motif-augmented edges is 8,361.

 4. User-Generated Item Recommendation [Download]   
 Most of the existing recommendation methods assume that all the items are provided by separate producers, which is however not true in some recommendation tasks. That is, it is possible that some of the items are generated by users. Appropriately considering the user-item generation relation may bring benefit to some recommender systems, e.g., implicit recommender systems with only implicit user-item interactions.  
 In our paper in Knowledge-Based Systems 2022, we have proposed a new method called Deep Interaction-Attribute-Generation (DIAG) model, which integrates the user-item interaction relation, the user-item generation relation and the item attribute information into one deep learning framework. And we have collected two datasets, namely Scholat and Lizhi.  
 The Scholat dataset is a post recommendation dataset obtained from the scholar social network https://www.scholat.com/  . The scholars are taken as users and the posts are taken as items. Each post is generated by at most one scholar (i.e. user-item generation) and will be read by many scholars (i.e. user-item interaction). The item attribute vector is obtained by applying word2vec to the 0/1-valued word vector representing the absence/presence of each word in the title and content of the post. The dimension of the item attribute vector is 372. Only the users with no less than 2 interactions are preserved. After preprocessing, a subset consisting of 1991 users and 5008 items is obtained. The number of user-item interactions is 13960. The number of user-item generations is 3776.  
 The Lizhi dataset is an audio recommendation dataset obtained from the online audio platform https://www.lizhi.fm  . The normal users are taken as users and the audios are taken as items. Each audio is generated by at most one user (i.e. user-item generation) and will be listened to by many users (i.e. user-item interaction). The item attribute vector characterizes the key information of the audio, namely the gender and age of the user generating this audio, and the bag of words (BOW) representation of the tags of the audio. The dimension of the item attribute vectors is 514. Only users with at least 10 user-item interactions are preserved. After preprocessing, a subset consisting of 3716 users and 9205 items is obtained. The number of user-item interactions is 858124. The number of user-item generations is 5744.

 5. SCHOLAT Interactive User Recommendation [Download]   
 Interactive recommender systems (IRS) have attracted more and more attention in recent years, which can receive user feedbacks on the recommendation list and constantly improve the recommendation results. This dataset contains 39,805 users and 680,267 historical interactions among them from SCHOLAT. The "user_attribute" directory contains 39,805 files which are user attributes with the user IDs (from 0 to 39,804) as file names. The user attributes are extracted from their biography in SCHOLAT and most of them are in Chinese. The file "user_interactions.txt" contains all the user interactions that are in the format as "User1::User2::Reward::Timestamp", where "User1" is the ID of user1, "User2" is the ID of user2, "Reward" represents the feedback or rating on user2 by user1, and "Timestamp" is the time at which this interaction happened. More specifically, if user1 clicks or browses user2's homepage, the reward is set as 1. If user1 follows user2, the reward is set as 3. If user1 unfollows user2, the reward is -1. All the user IDs range between 0 and 39,804.  
 This dataset will also be used for the third ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (3 rd  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 17th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2022).

 6. SCHOLAT Multiplex Network [Download]   
 The SCHOLAT Multiplex Network provides a comprehensive list of social information. In this network, we construct a multiplex structure with three layers: (1) The first layer represents connections between users who become friends. (2) The second layer represents connections between users who join the same groups. (3) The third layer represents connections between users who study the same courses. Furthermore, we define an individual ground-truth community based on the affiliation of users. All layers consist of the same 2,302 nodes with the highest quality. Each layer has a specific number of edges: 11,393 for the first layer, 139,004 for the second layer, and 70,226 for the third layer. We have divided these nodes into 11 communities.  
 This dataset will also be used for the fourth ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (4 th  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 18th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2023).  
  
  7. SCHOLAT ScholarNet [Download]   
 This dataset contains the user attributes and links among 9,537 users from SCHOLAT. The "attributes" directory contains 9,537 user attribute files with the user IDs as file names. The links data is divided into two parts: "train.csv" and "test.csv", which respectively include 128,924 and 32,231 undirected edges.  
 This dataset will be used for the fifth ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (5 th  CCSCW Cup) on the 19th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2024).

The conference is dedicated to offer an international platform for novel ideas and a fresh look on the methodologies to put crazy ideas into Business for the benefit of the human. Serendipity is a desired effect, and shall cross-fertilize methodologies and transfer of algorithmic developments.  
    
 MAKE  stands for MA  chine Learning & K  nowledge E  xtraction.  
 Machine learning  deals with understanding intelligence for the design and development of algorithms that can learn from data and improve over time. The original definition was “the artificial generation of knowledge from experience”.  The challenge is to discover relevant structural  patterns and/or temporal  patterns (“knowledge”) in such data, which are often hidden and not accessible to a human. Today, machine learning is the fastest growing technical field, having many application domains, e.g. health, Industry 4.0, recommender systems, speech recognition, autonomous driving, etc. The challenge is in decision making under uncertainty, and probabilistic inference enormously influenced artificial intelligence and statistical learning. The inverse probability allows to infer unknowns, learn from data and make predictions to support decision making. Whether in social networks, recommender systems, health or Industry 4.0 applications, the increasingly complex data sets require efficient, useful and useable solutions for knowledge discovery and knowledge extraction.   
 A synergistic combination of methodologies and approaches of two domains offer ideal conditions towards unraveling these challenges and to foster new, efficient and user-friendly machine learning algorithms and knowledge extraction tools: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)  and Knowledge Discovery/Data Mining (KDD)  , aiming at augmenting human intelligence with computational intelligence  and vice versa toward a human-centered AI  approach.  
 Consequently, successful Machine Learning & Knowledge extraction needs a concerted international effort without boundaries, supporting collaborative and integrative cross-disciplinary research between experts from 7 (the magical number seven +/- 0) fields.

    Creating a Call-To-Action (CTA)   
  Introduction   
 A "call to action", or CTA, is an important part of any well-designed web page. It's a clear and direct invitation for page visitors to take a specific  action. For example, you might ask a page visitor to register for a conference sign up for a newsletter, or download a resource.   
 A well-placed and well-written CTA can have an enormous impact on how well a website achieves its goals.   
 How do you create an effective CTA? The first step is to make sure you have a clear overall strategy and set of goals for your website. What exactly  do you want to achieve?   
 The more specific your CTA is, the better the results are likely to be. Put yourself in the web page visitor&aposs shoes. If your goal is for the visitor to register to attend a conference, it should be really  clear  how they do that.  Don&apost overthink it, and  try to keep it simple.   
 Before you create your CTA, take the time to define your strategy and the specific, measurable goals you want to achieve with your webpage. This will help to ensure your CTA gets the results you want. Thinking carefully about the desired outcomes and what you want the page visitor to actually do  will help ensure that you create CTAs that are effective.   
 This guide was created by the IEEE TechNav  team. It provides an overview of how to craft a well-performing CTA, with a step-by-step guide and some reference examples.   
  The Workflow   
 The flowchart below works through the process of creating a CTA for three different goals: driving traffic, driving registrations, and driving subscriptions or memberships. The process for each scenario is essentially the same, but the content varies for each one.   
 Start: Define Your Primary Goal and Pick One Path: | Begin by choosing your overall GOAL. Pick one   of the following paths: 
  ●    Option A: Drive General Traffic to Your Site:   Aimed at increasing the overall number of website visitors.   
 ●    Option B: Drive Registrations to an Event:   Focused on getting page visitors to sign up for an event, such as a webinar or conference.   
 ●    Option C: Drive Subscriptions or Memberships:   Targeted at increasing the number of subscribers or membership signups. e.g.  Subscribing to a newsletter joining a society/initiative/project, or even joining IEEE.   
    
 Based on the GOAL you have chosen,  identify the detail you need: 
  ●    If you chose Option A:   Identify the specific webpage you want to direct your page visitors to.   
 ●    If you chose  Option B:   List some clear and enticing details about the event. Be sure to include any special offers or time-sensitive details.   
 ●    If you chose Option C:   Summarize the benefits of the subscription or membership. Be sure to include any special offers or time-sensitive details.   
 Create your CTA 
  ●    If you chose  Option A:   Create a CTA that highlights the value or unique offerings of your website.   
 ●    If you chose  Option B:   Create a CTA that motivates readers to sign up, emphasizing what they will gain by attending.   
 ●    If you chose  Option C:   Create a CTA that focuses on what subscribers will receive, like exclusive content, discounts, or insider information.   
 Add CTA to Page: | Place the CTA strategically on your web page, ensuring that it is prominent and relevant to the content. You may want to place the CTA in multiple places, especially if the web page contains a longer post. 
  Publish your web page. 
  Once your web page is live, you should track its performance, and the performance of the CTA. Once you have some data consider making small adjustments to improve overall performance.   
  Designing & Placing Your CTA   
 Placing your CTA strategically on your webpage is vital for maximizing its effectiveness. One of the most important principles is to position your CTA "above the fold". The term "above the fold" originated with newspapers. Newspapers are often folded in half horizontally, with only the top half of the front page visible to potential buyers. This top half was referred to as being "above the fold." The content placed "above the fold" was considered the most important and attention-grabbing, as it was the first thing readers would see when they encountered the newspaper. Editors would place the most compelling headlines, images, and stories in this space to entice readers to purchase the paper and read further.   
 In the context of a web page, "above the fold" means the item should be visible without the user having to scroll down. This ensures that visitors immediately see the CTA and can easily take action  . If your webpage contains long-form content, consider placing the CTA at multiple points throughout the page to provide users with multiple opportunities to engage.   
 Another key aspect of CTA placement is to make it visually prominent  . Use contrasting colors that stand out from the rest of the page elements to draw attention to the CTA. Ensure that there is sufficient white space around the CTA to make it easily distinguishable. Additionally, consider the size of your CTA. It should be large enough to be noticeable but not so large that it overwhelms the page. Lastly, make sure your CTA is mobile-responsive and easily clickable on smaller screens. With the increasing number of users accessing websites through mobile devices, it's essential to optimize your CTA placement for various screen sizes.   
 By following these placement best practices you can significantly improve the chances of users noticing and interacting with your CTA, ultimately leading to better conversion rates and achievement of your website goals.   
  Hypothetical Examples   
 Here are some hypothetical Call-to-Actions (CTAs) for each path (driving traffic event registrations, and increasing subscribers). We use IEEE Public Safety as an example target.    

  OPTION A: Driving Traffic to the IEEE Public Safety Portal   
 Identified Webpage for Traffic:    
  The main webpage of the IEEE Public Safety portal.   

 Craft a CTA that Emphasizes Website Value:  
    "Discover the latest advancements in public safety technology and research. Visit  IEEE Public Safety Portal   now for cutting-edge insights and resources!"    

 Or   

 "Are you passionate about leveraging technology for public safety? Dive deeper into the world of innovation where technology meets humanitarian efforts. Explore our  IEEE Public Safety Portal   today and gain access to a treasure trove of resources including white papers, research findings, and expert interviews. Stay ahead of the curve in public safety technology. Your next big idea starts here!"    

  OPTION B: Driving Registrations to the IEEE Public Safety Conference   
 Detail Event Information and Benefits:    
  The conference is in October 2024, focusing on the latest trends and innovations in public safety.   

 Create a CTA that Encourages Event Sign-Up:    
  "Join the forefront of public safety innovation! Register for the IEEE Public Safety Conference 2024 today and connect with experts and peers this October.  Secure Your Spot Now!   "    

 Or   

 "This October, the future of public safety takes center stage at the IEEE Public Safety Conference 2024. Don't miss this unparalleled opportunity to network with the brightest minds in the field, from innovators in technology to frontline heroes. Discover the latest trends, breakthroughs and solutions that are shaping the landscape of public safety. Whether you're looking to enhance your knowledge, showcase your research, or find collaborative opportunities, this conference is your gateway.  Register now   and be part of the movement towards a safer tomorrow."    

  OPTION C: Driving Subscriptions to IEEE Public Safety Initiatives   
 Highlight Subscription Benefits and Offers:    
  Subscribers get access to exclusive content, updates on initiatives, and opportunities to participate in public safety projects.   

 Develop a CTA that Promotes Subscription Incentives:  
    "Be part of a community making a difference in public safety. Subscribe to IEEE Public Safety initiatives for exclusive updates and opportunities to contribute.  Join Us Today!   "    

 Or   

 "Become a beacon of change in the public safety community by subscribing to the IEEE Public Safety initiatives. As a subscriber, you're not just joining a group; you're becoming part of a global movement dedicated to making the world a safer place through innovation and technology. Receive exclusive updates on groundbreaking projects, invitations to webinars and workshops led by industry leaders, and opportunities to contribute to initiatives that directly impact public safety. Your expertise and passion can drive change.  Subscribe today   and take the first step towards making a meaningful difference."    

  Real Examples   
 The following examples were provided by Chris Franzino in Future Directions. All are from live IEEE sites. They demonstrate several different styles of CTA, and  show different methods of including the CTA in the published webpage.   
  OPTION A: Driving Traffic to the download page for "Beyond CMOS: the Future of Semiconductors" Whitepaper   
 The goal of this CTA was to drive traffic to the download page for the "Beyond CMOS" whitepaper created by IEEE IRDS. A single search-engine-optimized web post was written for the site, and the CTA was added.   
 Call To Action:     

 This CTA is a simple button/link that is placed throughout the web post. In this case, the entire page is about the "Beyond CMOS" topic, so further detail isn&apost necessary. An image of the whitepaper is also included. The graphic and button contrast nicely with the surrounding text, and the CTA is also placed above the fold. The result is a compelling and effective CTA.   

 Example CTA from   IEEE IRDS       

  OPTION B: Driving Registrations to IEEE Quantum Week   
 The goal of this CTA was to drive registrations to IEEE Quantum Week. Multiple search-engine-optimized web posts were written for the site, and the CTA was added to all of them. In general having multiple web posts with the same CTA can be very effective in driving website traffic.   
 Call To Action:     

 This CTA is placed at the bottom of the page and is in two parts: a simple button/link to the conference website and an invitation to join the Technical Community:   

 "Interested in joining the   IEEE Quantum Technical Community    ? IEEE Quantum is a global, multidisciplinary community of researchers and engineers dedicated to tackling the challenges related to quantum computing, information, engineering, algorithms, and corresponding technologies. Join today to stay informed of the latest quantum news, events opportunities, and more."      

 Example CTA from   IEEE Quantum Week       

  OPTION C: Driving Subscriptions to IEEE Digital Privacy Courses   
 The goal of this CTA was to drive signups to an IEEE Digital Privacy online course.  Multiple search-engine-optimized web posts were written for the site and the CTA was added to all of them. In general, having multiple web posts with the same CTA can be very effective in driving website traffic.   
 Call To Action:    

 "Interested in learning more about ethical issues related to data privacy and security? Learn more in our course program: Protecting Privacy in the Digital Age.   Access the Courses    "     

 The CTA is placed in the middle of the web post (circled at the bottom of the image below), and again at the end of the web post. An image with links to the course is also embedded near the start of the web post. Again, you can see that the image contrasts strongly with the text and the CTA appears above the fold.   

 Example CTA from   IEEE Digital Privacy       

  Conclusion   
 The key is to decide why  you are creating content and to have a clear goal that you want to achieve. Then you can design your CTA.   

 Each of these example CTAs are designed to be clear, engaging, and directly linked to the specific action the reader is supposed to take, whether it's visiting a website, registering for an event, or joining an initiative. They provide immediate value propositions and easy access to the next steps for the audience. Remember to be persuasive and clearly outline the value and benefits of taking the suggested action, whether it's exploring a portal attending a conference, or joining a group.   

 Once you&aposve mastered the art of creating high-performing CTAs you can start to experiment more e.g. adding more than one CTA to a single web page. However, for the best results, it is almost always best to keep your web page visitors focused on a single task.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 All the related original papers are welcome to submit. As always, the focus of the conference is “cooperative”. Therefore, research results concerning multiple users, multiple disciplinaries, multiple locations, multiple units, multiple sensors, multimodal cooperation and integration are all within our attention. The major areas are in design, visualization, and engineering, and any other cooperative applications. The areas include social networks, IoT, sensor networks, e-health care, e-education etc.  
 The proceedings of CDVE2024 will be published by the LNCS – Lecture Notes in Computer Science by Springer Nature. It will be indexed by Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), part of Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, EI Engineering Index (Compendex and Inspec databases), ACM Digital Library, DBLP, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Scopus, Zentralblatt MATH etc. Selected papers will have the opportunity to fully expand to be considered in a couple SCI indexed journals.  
 A recommended submission of abstracts is now open. You can submit the whole paper directly without submitting an abstract. However, we highly recommend you to submit an abstract first for some feedback before writing the full paper. The abstract submission deadline is Feb. 15, 2024. Full paper deadline is April 1, 2024.

 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)   
 Co-located with PPoPP, HPCA and CC   
 Las Vegas, USA   
 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in Las Vegas, USA. CGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
  CGO now uses two submissions per year.   
  This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.  
  First Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: May 30, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: July 9-11, 2024 
  Paper Notification: July 22, 2024 
  Second Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: September 12, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: October 22 - 24, 2024 
  Paper Notification: November 4, 2024

  Parallelism, heterogeneity, and reconfigurable architectures 
  Optimizations for heterogeneous or specialized targets, GPUs, SoCs, CGRA and Quantum Computers 
  Compiler support for vectorization, thread extraction, task scheduling, speculation, transaction, memory management, data distribution and synchronization 
  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

  Call for Papers  
  
 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)   
 Co-located with PPoPP, HPCA and CC   
 Las Vegas, USA   
 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in Las Vegas, USA. CGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
  CGO now uses two submissions per year.   
  This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.  
  First Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: May 30, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: July 9-11, 2024 
  Paper Notification: July 22, 2024 
  Second Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: September 12, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: October 22 - 24, 2024 
  Paper Notification: November 4, 2024

   Topics   
 Original contributions are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:  
 Code Generation, Translation, Transformation, and Optimization for performance, energy, virtualization, portability, security, or reliability concerns, and architectural support 
  Efficient execution of dynamically typed and higher-level languages 
  Optimization and code generation for emerging programming models, platforms, domain-specific languages 
  Dynamic/static, profile-guided, feedback-directed, and machine learning-based optimization 
  Static, Dynamic, and Hybrid Analysis for performance, energy, memory locality, throughput or latency, security, reliability, or functional debugging

  Novel and efficient tools 
  Compiler design, practice and experience 
  Compiler abstraction and intermediate representations 
  Vertical integration of language features, representations, optimizations, and runtime support for parallelism 
  Solutions that involve cross-layer (HW/OS/VM/SW) design and integration 
  Deployed dynamic/static compiler and runtime systems for general purpose, embedded system and Cloud/HPC platforms 
  Parallelism, heterogeneity, and reconfigurable architectures 
  Optimizations for heterogeneous or specialized targets, GPUs, SoCs, CGRA and Quantum Computers 
  Compiler support for vectorization, thread extraction, task scheduling, speculation, transaction, memory management, data distribution and synchronization 
  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)   
 Co-located with PPoPP, HPCA and CC   
 Las Vegas, USA   
 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in Las Vegas, USA. CGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
  CGO now uses two submissions per year.   
  This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.  
  First Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: May 30, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: July 9-11, 2024 
  Paper Notification: July 22, 2024 
  Second Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: September 12, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: October 22 - 24, 2024 
  Paper Notification: November 4, 2024

  Compiler support for vectorization, thread extraction, task scheduling, speculation, transaction, memory management, data distribution and synchronization 
  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)   
 Co-located with PPoPP, HPCA and CC   
 Las Vegas, USA   
 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in Las Vegas, USA. CGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
  CGO now uses two submissions per year.   
  This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.  
  First Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: May 30, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: July 9-11, 2024 
  Paper Notification: July 22, 2024 
  Second Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: September 12, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: October 22 - 24, 2024

  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)   
 Co-located with PPoPP, HPCA and CC   
 Las Vegas, USA   
 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in Las Vegas, USA. CGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
  CGO now uses two submissions per year.   
  This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.  
  First Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: May 30, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: July 9-11, 2024 
  Paper Notification: July 22, 2024 
  Second Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: September 12, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: October 22 - 24, 2024 
  Paper Notification: November 4, 2024

  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.
