 Venice, June 30 - July 4, 2025  
 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy  
   
 Call For Papers  
  The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is the younger, more adventurous, and tastier sibling conference of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland" or "NorCal S&P") conference. It is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.  
 We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Conference Expectations  
 Since its inception, EuroS&P has been running as a single-track conference. We believe that maintaining the engagement and sense-of-community benefits that come from a single-track conference is very beneficial. At the same time, we expect that with the rising number of submissions, the time allocated to each will decrease more and more. Therefore, at the time of publishing the CfP, we can neither commit to a single-track conference nor to the length of presentations at the conference.  
 We aim for a review process that will be rigorous and thorough, resulting in the acceptance of every paper with scientific merit and sufficient value to the community, and incorporate a four-week revision opportunity in which the PC assists authors to try to get as many papers as possible to the level needed.  
 Revision Option  
 EuroS&P features the option to revise papers for which the program committee sees a path for revision that is likely to lead to acceptance, even though the initial submission was not considered acceptable. If authors who are invited to do so wish to submit a revised paper, they must do so within four weeks of the notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed by the same reviewers who reviewed the original submission. Neither acceptance with shepherding nor an invitation to submit a revised paper implies that eventual acceptance is certain.  
 New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses  
 Almost all major security and privacy conferences feature an author-response phase, sometimes including interactive exchanges between authors and reviewers. As chairs, we have experienced this process to be challenging for both authors and reviewers; authors need to fit their response into a short word limit and reviewers must untangle the answers to their questions from the dense responses. To improve on this, EuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely  focus on the questions as well as factual errors. To ensure timely responses, we will provide the reviews for all papers which advance to Round 2 and will subsequently give authors approx. three working days to respond to the initial Round 1 reviews. Then, after Round 2, authors will be provided with all additional reviews and can respond to the new ones. Note that papers rejected after Round 1 will not be able to provide responses.  
 With this change, we hope to improve on the communication between individual reviewers and authors, but also to provide reviewers to read the responses with the papers still fresh in their minds rather than weeks after submitting their Round 1 reviews.  
 Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews  
 The discussions about individual papers are conducted “behind closed doors” within the set of reviewers. In the best case, reviewers will leave a summary of the discussion visible exclusively to the authors. To facilitate more transparency in the process of accepting papers, EuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta review (accessible through the EuroS&P website) for each accepted paper. This meta review will outline the PC’s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate.  
 Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix "SoK:" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Paper Awards  
 Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards. The award finalists and winners will be announced at the symposium.

 Proactive Prevention of Harm  
 We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although risking to cause harm is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they addressed and mitigated such risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, and following responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement as to how the benefit of the research outweighs the potential harms, and how the authors have taken measures and followed best practices to ensure safety and minimize the potential harms caused by their research.  
 If the submitted research has potential to cause harm, and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB was consulted appropriately and that its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. We note that IRBs are not necessarily well-versed in computer security research and may not know the best practices and community norms in our field, so IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work. In particular, IRB approval is not sufficient to guarantee that the PC will not have additional concerns with respect to harms associated with the research.  
 We encourage authors to consult existing documentation, e.g., Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them  or the Menlo Report  and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the Tor Safety Research Board  . These can help in thinking about potential harms, and in designing the safest experiments and disclosure processes.  
 Open Science Expectations  
 Our expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. This means that, by default, all of the code, data, and other materials (such as survey instruments) needed to reproduce your work described in an accepted paper will be released publicly under an open source license. Sometimes it is not possible to share work this openly, such as when it involves malware samples, data from human subjects that must be protected, or proprietary data obtained under agreement that preclude publishing the data itself. All submissions must  therefore include a clear statement on Data Availability ( as a separate appendix which does not count towards the page limit  ) that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared. The Program Chairs will hold authors to the commitments made in their submissions, and papers that fail to satisfy these commitments may be removed from the conference.  
 Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission  
 All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (whether of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. The submission must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. References should only be blinded in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. This explicitly excludes hosting on Github (which may leak author identities) or Google Drive (which could leak reviewer identities). Instead, authors are encouraged to use services such Anonymous Github  . Contact the program chairs if you have any questions. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. Hence authors are required to ensure that the paper they submit does not, within reason, leak their identity.  
 However, the process of anonymous submission is considered to be cooperative, not adversarial. Authors should not put explicit clues to their identity in the paper or otherwise purposefully deanonymize themselves to reviewers. Authors who think disclosing revealing aspects of their identities or setting would be important for positioning the paper, should consult with the PC chairs on how to do this in their submission. Reviewers are trusted to not actively look for the identity of authors, for instance by searching the internet for the paper title. By policy, authors may post their paper to public "preprint" archives (including arxiv) before, during, or after the review period.  
 The Program Chairs will reject papers that, in their sole judgment, blatantly violate the requirement for author anonymity.  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to, and rejected from, another conference, authors may optionally submit a separate document containing the (anonymized, but otherwise unedited) prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper.  
 To avoid biasing reviewers, reviewers will only see the provided supplementary material after submitting their own review. Then, reviewers will be able to see the submitted previous reviews, and may revise their review as a result.  
 Page Limit and Formatting  
 Papers shall not exceed 13 pages of body text, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. The statement on Data Availability should be part of the appendix, and does not count towards the page limit. Reviewers are explicitly not expected to read the appendices while deciding whether to accept or reject the paper.  
 Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not "US Letter") using the IEEE conference proceeding template we supply eurosp-template.zip  Please do not use other IEEE templates.  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white.  
 Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection without review.  
 Conference Submission Server  
 Papers must be submitted at https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org  and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.  
 Publication and Presentation  
 Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference. We are expecting to hold an in-person conference and that authors will be able to travel to the conference to present their paper. In case this is not possible, at least one author still must register for the conference, but unless a replacement for the presenter can be found, the presentation will be skipped. Instead, EuroS&P will offer to link to a video presentation from its website.

  Vision 

 32nd EuroSPI Conference  
 EuroSPI² 2025 (10 - 12 September 2025) will have 10 international thematic workshop streams supported by thematic topic communities and the ICSSP (International System and Software Process Association) conference will take place as a co-located partner event. Each thematic stream integrates both, research sessions and industry / applied science sessions. The thematic streams will be a mix of pitch talks provoking discussions, full presentations and panel discussions which will focus on specific questions of interest. 
  Thematic Workshop Sessions  
 EuroSPI² 2025, (10 - 12 September 2025), hosted by Riga Technical University, Riga, Latvia, will have international key notes as plenary sessions and thematic workshops integrating research and industry experience. Researchers present case studies and new research which can in future be considered by industry and in the workshops. Industry presents best practices from industry and discusses the approaches and methods with experts. The goal is to fertilize the cooperation between research and industry. Additionally we involve strategic EU projects to empower new directions and co-operations. 
  Social Events  
 We believe that networking and creating research and business relationships is important to create a sustainable community for improvement and innovation. While the conference offers ideas, presentations, discussions, knowledge during the day, the social talks after the conference are equally important to establish trust and partnerships. We also believe that Europe integrates many regions with different cultures and to build European trust based partnerships we need to learn about the culture of regions. So please join the networking space and social events. 
  Key Notes  
 Key notes are plenary sessions by key experts from industry or research. Key notes (if accepted) are used to create key statements in the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We have every year 5 key notes from leading industry and research. Please visit our key notes page and the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We also invite key industry at the EuroSPI technology day, please visit our technology day page and download the free available presentations. 
  Workshop Communities  
 The thematic workshops allow leading industry and research to attend EuroAsiaSPI not only for a conference but also for a dedicated topic based workshop/training event. These workshop are dealing with hot topics and contain key papers and interactive sessions with open discussions. Participants work with the speakers to elaborate key statements to follow up in the next years workshops. The thematic workshops will be published as separate chapters in the annual SPRINGER book in the CCIS series. 
  EuroSPI as a Hybrid Event  
 We will continue to use the advanced technology equipment and organise an onsite and online hybrid event using integrated sound, cameras and video streaming combined with technical and content moderator roles in each workshop. Since EuroSPI² 2020 we have organised this hybrid event very successfully and feedback from attendees encourage us to continue with this new approach. 
  Social Events  
 Europe has many different regional cultures and customs, and still we need to work together in the EU frameworks. Already at the start of EuroAsiaSPI² in 1994 it was decided to place the conference in a different region every year and that the local host organises social events that help us to learn about the hosting culture, the traditions, history and the local food. This has a large influence on what social events EuroAsiaSPI² offers.This year we will explore the famous Bamberger House at the entrance of the Luitpold park with classical music by price winning musicians, and a traditional Bavarian beer festival in Rosenheim. 
  EuroSPI² Target Groups  
 Join our Improvement Community to which more than 28 Nations have been contributed since 1994.

 Venice, June 30 - July 4, 2025  
 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy  
   
 Call For Papers  
  The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is the younger, more adventurous, and tastier sibling conference of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland" or "NorCal S&P") conference. It is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.  
 We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Conference Expectations  
 Since its inception, EuroS&P has been running as a single-track conference. We believe that maintaining the engagement and sense-of-community benefits that come from a single-track conference is very beneficial. At the same time, we expect that with the rising number of submissions, the time allocated to each will decrease more and more. Therefore, at the time of publishing the CfP, we can neither commit to a single-track conference nor to the length of presentations at the conference.  
 We aim for a review process that will be rigorous and thorough, resulting in the acceptance of every paper with scientific merit and sufficient value to the community, and incorporate a four-week revision opportunity in which the PC assists authors to try to get as many papers as possible to the level needed.  
 Revision Option  
 EuroS&P features the option to revise papers for which the program committee sees a path for revision that is likely to lead to acceptance, even though the initial submission was not considered acceptable. If authors who are invited to do so wish to submit a revised paper, they must do so within four weeks of the notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed by the same reviewers who reviewed the original submission. Neither acceptance with shepherding nor an invitation to submit a revised paper implies that eventual acceptance is certain.  
 New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses  
 Almost all major security and privacy conferences feature an author-response phase, sometimes including interactive exchanges between authors and reviewers. As chairs, we have experienced this process to be challenging for both authors and reviewers; authors need to fit their response into a short word limit and reviewers must untangle the answers to their questions from the dense responses. To improve on this, EuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely  focus on the questions as well as factual errors. To ensure timely responses, we will provide the reviews for all papers which advance to Round 2 and will subsequently give authors approx. three working days to respond to the initial Round 1 reviews. Then, after Round 2, authors will be provided with all additional reviews and can respond to the new ones. Note that papers rejected after Round 1 will not be able to provide responses.  
 With this change, we hope to improve on the communication between individual reviewers and authors, but also to provide reviewers to read the responses with the papers still fresh in their minds rather than weeks after submitting their Round 1 reviews.  
 Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews  
 The discussions about individual papers are conducted “behind closed doors” within the set of reviewers. In the best case, reviewers will leave a summary of the discussion visible exclusively to the authors. To facilitate more transparency in the process of accepting papers, EuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta review (accessible through the EuroS&P website) for each accepted paper. This meta review will outline the PC’s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate.  
 Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix "SoK:" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Paper Awards  
 Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards. The award finalists and winners will be announced at the symposium.

 Proactive Prevention of Harm  
 We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although risking to cause harm is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they addressed and mitigated such risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, and following responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement as to how the benefit of the research outweighs the potential harms, and how the authors have taken measures and followed best practices to ensure safety and minimize the potential harms caused by their research.  
 If the submitted research has potential to cause harm, and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB was consulted appropriately and that its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. We note that IRBs are not necessarily well-versed in computer security research and may not know the best practices and community norms in our field, so IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work. In particular, IRB approval is not sufficient to guarantee that the PC will not have additional concerns with respect to harms associated with the research.  
 We encourage authors to consult existing documentation, e.g., Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them  or the Menlo Report  and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the Tor Safety Research Board  . These can help in thinking about potential harms, and in designing the safest experiments and disclosure processes.  
 Open Science Expectations  
 Our expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. This means that, by default, all of the code, data, and other materials (such as survey instruments) needed to reproduce your work described in an accepted paper will be released publicly under an open source license. Sometimes it is not possible to share work this openly, such as when it involves malware samples, data from human subjects that must be protected, or proprietary data obtained under agreement that preclude publishing the data itself. All submissions must  therefore include a clear statement on Data Availability ( as a separate appendix which does not count towards the page limit  ) that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared. The Program Chairs will hold authors to the commitments made in their submissions, and papers that fail to satisfy these commitments may be removed from the conference.  
 Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission  
 All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (whether of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. The submission must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. References should only be blinded in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. This explicitly excludes hosting on Github (which may leak author identities) or Google Drive (which could leak reviewer identities). Instead, authors are encouraged to use services such Anonymous Github  . Contact the program chairs if you have any questions. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. Hence authors are required to ensure that the paper they submit does not, within reason, leak their identity.  
 However, the process of anonymous submission is considered to be cooperative, not adversarial. Authors should not put explicit clues to their identity in the paper or otherwise purposefully deanonymize themselves to reviewers. Authors who think disclosing revealing aspects of their identities or setting would be important for positioning the paper, should consult with the PC chairs on how to do this in their submission. Reviewers are trusted to not actively look for the identity of authors, for instance by searching the internet for the paper title. By policy, authors may post their paper to public "preprint" archives (including arxiv) before, during, or after the review period.  
 The Program Chairs will reject papers that, in their sole judgment, blatantly violate the requirement for author anonymity.  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to, and rejected from, another conference, authors may optionally submit a separate document containing the (anonymized, but otherwise unedited) prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper.  
 To avoid biasing reviewers, reviewers will only see the provided supplementary material after submitting their own review. Then, reviewers will be able to see the submitted previous reviews, and may revise their review as a result.  
 Page Limit and Formatting  
 Papers shall not exceed 13 pages of body text, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. The statement on Data Availability should be part of the appendix, and does not count towards the page limit. Reviewers are explicitly not expected to read the appendices while deciding whether to accept or reject the paper.  
 Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not "US Letter") using the IEEE conference proceeding template we supply eurosp-template.zip  Please do not use other IEEE templates.  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white.  
 Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection without review.  
 Conference Submission Server  
 Papers must be submitted at https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org  and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.  
 Publication and Presentation  
 Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference. We are expecting to hold an in-person conference and that authors will be able to travel to the conference to present their paper. In case this is not possible, at least one author still must register for the conference, but unless a replacement for the presenter can be found, the presentation will be skipped. Instead, EuroS&P will offer to link to a video presentation from its website.

  Paper Submission  
 EuroSPI² 2025 (10-12.09.2025) will have 10 international thematic workshop streams supported by thematic topic communities. Each thematic stream integrates both, research sessions and industry / applied science sessions. The thematic streams will be a mix of pitch talks provoking discussions, full presentations and panel discussions which will focus on specific topics of interest. EuroSPI Research Papers  and Thematic Workshop Papers  are grouped into major topics, which can be attended in the form of workshops. Selected workshop papers are published as special chapters in the annual EuroSPI Springer book in the CCIS series  . The EuroSPI series has had above 1.4 million downloads in Springer online so far, which makes it one of the most frequently read and referenced series in industry and research. Selected extended papers will be published in the Wiley Journal of Software: Evolution and Process.    
 EuroSPI² 2025 and SPRINGER now allow to submit 3 types:  
  Full paper:  ca. 12 to 15 pages, full elaborated case study, research study  
  Short paper:  ca. 6-8 pages, addresses an important case study or research result  
  Key statement / poster:  ca. 4 pages, making a key experience/best practice statement  
 A selected set of papers (peer reviewed by a journal committee) will be published in the Wiley Journal Software Evolution and Process Series.  
 Also, from 2022 onward EuroSPI create its own online journal of presentations as a NID (Net Interactive Document Service). You can access the NID service online  .

 Venice, June 30 - July 4, 2025  
 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy  
   
 Call For Papers  
  The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is the younger, more adventurous, and tastier sibling conference of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland" or "NorCal S&P") conference. It is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.  
 We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Conference Expectations  
 Since its inception, EuroS&P has been running as a single-track conference. We believe that maintaining the engagement and sense-of-community benefits that come from a single-track conference is very beneficial. At the same time, we expect that with the rising number of submissions, the time allocated to each will decrease more and more. Therefore, at the time of publishing the CfP, we can neither commit to a single-track conference nor to the length of presentations at the conference.  
 We aim for a review process that will be rigorous and thorough, resulting in the acceptance of every paper with scientific merit and sufficient value to the community, and incorporate a four-week revision opportunity in which the PC assists authors to try to get as many papers as possible to the level needed.  
 Revision Option  
 EuroS&P features the option to revise papers for which the program committee sees a path for revision that is likely to lead to acceptance, even though the initial submission was not considered acceptable. If authors who are invited to do so wish to submit a revised paper, they must do so within four weeks of the notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed by the same reviewers who reviewed the original submission. Neither acceptance with shepherding nor an invitation to submit a revised paper implies that eventual acceptance is certain.  
 New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses  
 Almost all major security and privacy conferences feature an author-response phase, sometimes including interactive exchanges between authors and reviewers. As chairs, we have experienced this process to be challenging for both authors and reviewers; authors need to fit their response into a short word limit and reviewers must untangle the answers to their questions from the dense responses. To improve on this, EuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely  focus on the questions as well as factual errors. To ensure timely responses, we will provide the reviews for all papers which advance to Round 2 and will subsequently give authors approx. three working days to respond to the initial Round 1 reviews. Then, after Round 2, authors will be provided with all additional reviews and can respond to the new ones. Note that papers rejected after Round 1 will not be able to provide responses.  
 With this change, we hope to improve on the communication between individual reviewers and authors, but also to provide reviewers to read the responses with the papers still fresh in their minds rather than weeks after submitting their Round 1 reviews.  
 Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews  
 The discussions about individual papers are conducted “behind closed doors” within the set of reviewers. In the best case, reviewers will leave a summary of the discussion visible exclusively to the authors. To facilitate more transparency in the process of accepting papers, EuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta review (accessible through the EuroS&P website) for each accepted paper. This meta review will outline the PC’s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate.  
 Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix "SoK:" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Paper Awards  
 Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards. The award finalists and winners will be announced at the symposium.

 Proactive Prevention of Harm  
 We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although risking to cause harm is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they addressed and mitigated such risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, and following responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement as to how the benefit of the research outweighs the potential harms, and how the authors have taken measures and followed best practices to ensure safety and minimize the potential harms caused by their research.  
 If the submitted research has potential to cause harm, and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB was consulted appropriately and that its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. We note that IRBs are not necessarily well-versed in computer security research and may not know the best practices and community norms in our field, so IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work. In particular, IRB approval is not sufficient to guarantee that the PC will not have additional concerns with respect to harms associated with the research.  
 We encourage authors to consult existing documentation, e.g., Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them  or the Menlo Report  and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the Tor Safety Research Board  . These can help in thinking about potential harms, and in designing the safest experiments and disclosure processes.  
 Open Science Expectations  
 Our expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. This means that, by default, all of the code, data, and other materials (such as survey instruments) needed to reproduce your work described in an accepted paper will be released publicly under an open source license. Sometimes it is not possible to share work this openly, such as when it involves malware samples, data from human subjects that must be protected, or proprietary data obtained under agreement that preclude publishing the data itself. All submissions must  therefore include a clear statement on Data Availability ( as a separate appendix which does not count towards the page limit  ) that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared. The Program Chairs will hold authors to the commitments made in their submissions, and papers that fail to satisfy these commitments may be removed from the conference.  
 Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission  
 All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (whether of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. The submission must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. References should only be blinded in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. This explicitly excludes hosting on Github (which may leak author identities) or Google Drive (which could leak reviewer identities). Instead, authors are encouraged to use services such Anonymous Github  . Contact the program chairs if you have any questions. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. Hence authors are required to ensure that the paper they submit does not, within reason, leak their identity.  
 However, the process of anonymous submission is considered to be cooperative, not adversarial. Authors should not put explicit clues to their identity in the paper or otherwise purposefully deanonymize themselves to reviewers. Authors who think disclosing revealing aspects of their identities or setting would be important for positioning the paper, should consult with the PC chairs on how to do this in their submission. Reviewers are trusted to not actively look for the identity of authors, for instance by searching the internet for the paper title. By policy, authors may post their paper to public "preprint" archives (including arxiv) before, during, or after the review period.  
 The Program Chairs will reject papers that, in their sole judgment, blatantly violate the requirement for author anonymity.  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to, and rejected from, another conference, authors may optionally submit a separate document containing the (anonymized, but otherwise unedited) prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper.  
 To avoid biasing reviewers, reviewers will only see the provided supplementary material after submitting their own review. Then, reviewers will be able to see the submitted previous reviews, and may revise their review as a result.  
 Page Limit and Formatting  
 Papers shall not exceed 13 pages of body text, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. The statement on Data Availability should be part of the appendix, and does not count towards the page limit. Reviewers are explicitly not expected to read the appendices while deciding whether to accept or reject the paper.  
 Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not "US Letter") using the IEEE conference proceeding template we supply eurosp-template.zip  Please do not use other IEEE templates.  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white.  
 Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection without review.  
 Conference Submission Server  
 Papers must be submitted at https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org  and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.  
 Publication and Presentation  
 Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference. We are expecting to hold an in-person conference and that authors will be able to travel to the conference to present their paper. In case this is not possible, at least one author still must register for the conference, but unless a replacement for the presenter can be found, the presentation will be skipped. Instead, EuroS&P will offer to link to a video presentation from its website.

 Program Preview  

 The core of the conference program are the  writers’ workshops   where the accepted papers will be discussed. Additionally, we offer an Open Space format for the accepted  focus group  proposals. The conference also contains many social activities to foster social networking.   

 Writers Workshops  

 This is where your paper is discussed during the conference. The workshops group together the authors of up to five papers that thematically fit together. Shortly before the conference begins, we will publish the paper-to workshop assignments. If you are an author, use this page to find which workshop you are assigned to. Non-authors, please use the same page to decide which group you would like to join throughout the conference. All participants should download, print and read all the papers in their group before the conference.    

 EuroPLoP is the premier European conference on patterns and pattern languages. Design patterns are a unique and effective way to capture and share expertise, tacit knowledge and research findings.  

 Submission      

 Unlike other conferences, EuroPLoP focuses on improving papers instead of only presenting them. Authors will receive high quality feedback in a constructive way during the shepherding process and during the workshops at the conference. The feedback can be used to improve submitted papers for final publication.  
 We hope to be able to organize the conference on-site, but this is subject to change, considering any restrictions imposed by Covid-19. EuroPLoP’s registration fee is normally 1111€ and covers all activities, accommodation, and food.

 Call for Focus Group Proposals  

 Do you have a pattern-related topic with the potential to spark a discussion? Focus Groups at EuroPLoP are an excellent opportunity to collaborate with other passionate pattern writers. They are 1 to 2 hour sessions, usually workshops, but you are welcome to experiment with different formats. Your submission should include a summary of the topic, outcomes you envision, a brief description of how you will organize the session, its time budget, and the required number of participants.  

 Focus Group Proposal submission deadline: May 16, 2025   

 Paper Submission Process  

 The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings will be published. After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd. This is an experienced pattern author, who will provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. Following several iterations of shepherding, your improved second draft will be reviewed again and accepted or rejected for the conference. On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published. The submission system is available under https://www.europlop.net/submission/  .  

 Paper Submission Format  

 The final submission for publication must be formatted using the two-column  ACM template  ,  but for the drafts and intermediate versions,  you can use any format. However, we encourage you to use the ACM format  right from the beginning to avoid layout problems in the end. If you don’t  intend to publish with ACM, you can choose whatever format you like. We  recommend 10 pages as a guideline and especially welcome shorter papers.  Longer papers are also possible but bear in mind that the writers’ workshop  might decide to focus only on a part of your paper. Have a look at the   introductory information pack  for examples.    

 EuroPLoP Values  

 High-quality feedback  
 All submissions will benefit from an iterative shepherding process prior to the conference: an experienced pattern author will give you  feedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. In Writers’  Workshops – the core of the conference – peers and experts will  discuss your paper. You will receive in-depth, constructive feedback  and insights to improve your paper further. If you wish, you may  complement your paper with alternative media (e.g., short video clips  linked from the paper) to get feedback on that format as well.   
 Share and learn  
 Patterns are an effective way to share knowledge about a domain. The interdisciplinary topics of the conference will provide you with new insights and inspiring ideas from other fields.  
 Theory and practice  
 EuroPLoP, with its creative and constructive atmosphere, attracts participants from both industry and academia. You will be part of a unique community of pattern book authors, researchers, and practitioners.  

 The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings will be published. After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd.  

 On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published.  
  
 The final submission for publication must be formatted using the Springer format, but you can use any format for the drafts and intermediate versions.

 The increasing power of computers has significantly extended the application of high computing methodologies in both research and industry, enabling the quantitative study of complex phenomena. This track aims to provide a platform for a multidisciplinary community composed of scholars, researchers, developers, educators, practitioners, and experts from world-leading universities, institutions, agencies, and companies in the field of Computational Science and High-Performance Computing (HPC) for Modeling and Simulation.  
 The intent of this track is to offer an opportunity to express and confront views on trends, challenges, and state-of-the-art developments in diverse application fields such as engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, life sciences, geology, medicine, ecology, sociology, traffic control, and economy. Professionals will have the opportunity to present significant applications, new approaches, cutting-edge techniques, and results, and to discuss research challenges related to the use of HPC to support the modeling and simulation of various systems.  
 A particularly exciting and rapidly growing area within the HPC landscape is the integration of Quantum Computing Systems (QCS). While still emerging and facing important challenges such as scalability and reliability, QCS presents promising opportunities to enhance computational performance and solve problems more efficiently than classical systems. Moreover, HPC infrastructures will play a key role in allowing the community to design and implement the different layers of QCS, such as control, optimization during compilation, error correction, resource estimation, and noise reduction. The integration of HPC and QCS systems, whether physically co-located or through the cloud, offers new scenarios for modeling and simulating complex problems across a range of scientific fields. However, significant research is needed to fully realize the potential of these hybrid systems.  
 The topics of the High-Performance Computing Track include, but are not limited to:  
 High-performance computing in modeling and simulation of systems. 
  MPI, OpenMP, GPGPU implementation, and benchmarking of various systems models. 
  Integration of HPC and QCS systems for enhanced computational performance.

  The term “human agent” combines concepts such as artificial societies, virtual crowds and synthetic populations. These concepts are used in various fields, such as smart city planning, emergency management and national security. Agent-based simulation models involving human agents can capture the decision-making processes of individuals as they interact with and respond to other individuals and their environment. They are also used for various research tasks, such as policy decision support, what-if scenarios, predictive modeling, and guiding data collection.  
 Of particular interest are artificial societies in which the behavior of individual agents is guided by findings from computational social sciences and calibrated using data from the real world. These heterogeneous, often cooperative agents participate in social networks, which can be physical (e.g. workplaces, schools, sporting events) or virtual (e.g. chat groups with shared interests). Human agents are generally mobile in an environment where they are exposed to social factors and physical constraints. Since multi-agent systems are based on the distributed AI paradigm, autonomy and learning, e.g. in the form of reinforcement learning, are essential components of the system.  
 Despite the many applications and resulting publications, there remain basic methodological challenges in modeling realistic human behavior. These challenges include agent representation, construction of behavioral rules, incorporation of behavioral theories and their assumptions, validation and calibration of models representing complex social phenomena, and the detection and management of emergent behavior at the societal level.  
 Therefore, authors are encouraged to submit papers related to, but not limited to, the following areas:  
 Design and implementation of human agents and artificial societies (e.g., case studies, analyses of moral and ethical considerations). 
  LLM (Large Language Model)-based agents. 
  Learning / intelligent agents. 
  The role of the non-stationary environment for the simulation result. 
  Applications of human agents and cooperative artificial societies (e.g. modeling of group decisions and collective behavior, emergence of social structures and norms, dynamics of social networks). 
  Data collection for artificial societies (e.g., using simulations to identify data gaps, population simulations with multiple data sources, use of the Internet of Things). 
  Participatory modeling and simulation 
  Policy development and evaluation through simulations 
  Improved models of social behavior 
  Simulations of societies as public educational tools 
  Mixed-methods (e.g., analyzing or generating text data with artificial societies, combining machine learning and artificial societies) 
  Models of individual decision-making, mobility patterns, or socio-environmental interactions 
  Testbeds and environments to facilitate artificial society development 
  Addressing longstanding challenges (model validation, re-use, communication)

 Standing at the center of climate change, sustainability is the greatest challenge and opportunity of this century. A new generation of sustainable systems will incorporate increasingly sophisticated sensing, control, and communication technologies that maintain or improve performance while using smart management to consume less energy and material. The new capabilities created by these “smart” systems have the potential to radically transform our economy. At the same time, smart systems necessarily include complex software that must be cost-effective and perform reliably while overseeing critical tasks.  
 Modeling and Simulation (M&S) plays an indispensable role in achieving the simultaneous goals of reliability and affordability by providing virtual venues in which to explore requirements, test new materials and physical instruments, develop new algorithms, and perform software testing. This track invites papers describing novel uses of modeling and simulation to create and demonstrate systems that strive towards smart energy management and a sustainable future.

 The past two decades have brought about a dramatic increase in the deployment of simulation-based techniques in medicine, healthcare, and human performance models. Simulation scenarios are used extensively for training of medical personnel, students, first responders, and emergency response coordinators. Rapid advances in computer technologies, biomedical engineering, and systems engineering drive the development of cyber-physical systems that serve as simulation-based training platforms. Discrete-event and agent-based models are applied to representing population-based scenarios ranging from clinics to geographical epidemiology scenarios and asking what-if questions for improved outcomes. Physiological processes are modeled and discretized through coupled equations, both in isolation and in integrative physiology contexts. Increasingly, there is also an interest in modeling these processes at several scales, spanning the molecular, to cellular, to tissue and organ-wide scales. However, it is clear that methodological and theoretical foundations need to be strengthened to provide integrated, connected, and cross-cutting solutions for modeling and simulation in medicine, healthcare and human performance optimization. Thus, this meeting will attempt to “connect” researchers, developers, and medical practitioners to define unifying themes conducive to such solutions.  
 The conference will focus on (but is not limited to) the following topical areas:  
 Modeling and simulation in medicine: fundamental research. 
  Training and education. 
  Care delivery, outcomes, and patient’s safety. 
  Robotics and its applications in training and “in vivo”. 
  Life-critical systems. 
  Systems integration: “connected health”. 
  Cybersecurity and healthcare. 
  Human performance and ergonomics models. 
  Discrete-event and agent-based approaches to healthcare. 
  Physiological modeling, from single-system to integrative approaches. 
  Multi-scale modeling and simulation in medicine. 
  Descriptive anatomical modeling for medical simulation. 
   
 Papers are solicited to address the above and related areas with focus on both the underlying methodological and theoretical foundations and practical applications.

  Jalal Possik, Université Catholique de Lille, Lille, France, | jalal.possik@univ-catholille.fr 
   
 The SET track is seeking submissions for papers, panels, and workshops related to the following two areas:  
 Simulation Education: This area focuses on teaching and learning simulation in engineering, sciences, social sciences, or any other discipline where simulation techniques are used in traditional or online settings. We welcome submissions that discuss and share pedagogical models, best practices, lessons learned, program/course projects, tools, case studies, and other resources for training the next generation of simulation experts.  
 Simulation-Based Learning (SBL): SBL refers to the use of simulation models and tools to enrich teaching and learning. SBL offers a wide range of opportunities for experiential learning and to practice critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. Research shows that SBL is among the most effective ways to learn complex skills across different domains as it enables knowledge application in a virtual yet realistic environment. Moreover, SBL educational experiences can be made available to geographically dispersed students in support of remote and online learning. All learning situations are of interest (formal/informal, in-person/distance learning, K-12, Higher Education, Professional Training, Continuing Education, etc.)  
 We encourage contributions that explore emerging trends in both Simulation Education and SBL, highlighting the potential of these tools to reshape education in the years ahead. Submissions from educators, academic researchers, industry professionals, instructional designers, educational technologists, and interdisciplinary teams are welcome, as we seek to uncover the full potential of simulation in transforming educational practices.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Implementation and assessment of SBL in courses from any domain (engineering, sciences, social sciences, etc.). 
  Problem-/project-based, experiential, and collaborative learning via SBL. 
  Skill development and workforce training via SBL. 
  SBL in online, in-person, and blended learning models. 
  Immersive simulated learning environments (augmented, virtual, and mixed reality, immersive game-based learning). 
  Comparative studies on the effectiveness of SBL vs other teaching and learning methods. 
  Learning analytics in SBL.

  The Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference (ANNSIM) offers conference attendees a stimulating and informative selection of tutorials reflecting current topics in the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) domain. Therefore, we invite experts in the M&S domain to present engaging tutorials at the ANNSIM 2025 conference. Tutorials provide researchers and practitioners with the opportunity to introduce their applications, tools, methodologies, or theories in 90-120 minute sessions.  
 Tutorials can be introductory, oriented toward participants who are interested in broadening their knowledge, or advanced, for participants who seek the latest advances in M&S. We encourage M&S researchers and practitioners in academia, government agencies, or industry to submit proposals for tutorials. Topics of interest include M&S theories, methodologies, and tools applied to any domain.  
 While both tutorials and workshops are designed to educate participants, they differ in their format and focus. A tutorial typically focuses on teaching specific skills, tools, or methodologies through structured presentations and demonstrations. It is more lecture-based, with the primary goal being to provide practical knowledge or insights to the attendees. In contrast, a workshop is more interactive and collaborative, often involving group discussions, hands-on activities, or problem-solving sessions. Workshops aim to engage participants more directly and may include the submission of papers or other contributions.  
 Proposals should be one to two pages and must include the following information:  
 Title of the workshop/tutorial and description (max 2 pages) 
  Organizers and their affiliations (including short bios) 
  Expected duration of the workshop/tutorial: 90 minutes, 120 minutes, a half-day, or full day. 
  If the proposal type is:   
 Workshop: Provide a sample call for papers, including workshop main topics. 
  Tutorial: Provide an abstract of the tutorial (up to 2 pages). A tutorial may submit a full paper to one of the related technical tracks, and if accepted after peer-review, it will appear in the conference proceedings. 
  Tutorial/workshop proposals should be submitted to the tutorial/workshop section in the conference system.

14. Conference EuroSys_1:
Call for Papers  
 EuroSys 2025 will adopt a dual-deadline format -- dates for both deadlines are shown below. Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at EuroSys 2025  
 The European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys) is a premier international forum for presenting computer systems research. This 20th edition of EuroSys will be jointly organized with ASPLOS 2025   . I.e. the conferences will be co-located and there will be a shared registration fee. To find out more about submitting a paper to ASPLOS 2025, please refer to their website  .  
 EuroSys 2025 seeks papers on all areas of computer systems research, including:  
 Operating systems 
  Distributed systems 
  Cloud computing and datacenter systems 
  File and storage systems 
  Networked systems 
  Language support and runtime systems 
  Systems security and privacy 
  Dependable systems 
  Analysis, testing and verification of systems 
  Database systems and data analytics frameworks 
  Virtualization and virtualized systems 
  Systems for machine learning/machine learning for systems 
  Mobile and pervasive systems 
  Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems 
  Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems 
  Systems for emerging hardware 
   
 We encourage papers that span multiple topics and communities. Papers will be judged on novelty, significance correctness, and clarity. The program committee seeks papers that address a significant problem with an interesting and compelling solution whose validity and practicality are clearly demonstrated. A good paper will draw appropriate conclusions, honestly present related prior work, acknowledge its own limitations and clearly articulate the advances it offers over prior work.  
 Important dates  
  EuroSys 2025 will adopt a dual-deadline format. Deadline dates for the two submission periods are shown below. Accepted papers from both submission periods will be presented at EuroSys 2025. All deadlines are AoE time   .  
 Spring deadline  
 Paper titles and abstracts due: | Tuesday May 14, 2024 (AoE) 
  Full paper submissions due: | Tuesday, May 21, 2024 (AoE) 
  Reviews available: | Wednesday, July 31, 2024 (AoE) 
  Author responses due: | Friday, August 2, 2024 (AoE) 
  Notification to authors: | Wednesday, Aug 21, 2024 (AoE) 
  Camera-ready deadline: | Monday, September 23, 2024 (AoE) 
  Fall deadline  
 Paper titles and abstracts due: | Tuesday, October 15, 2024 (AoE) 
  Full paper submissions due: | Tuesday, October 22, 2024 (AoE) 
  Reviews available: | Tuesday, January 7, 2025 (AoE) 
  Author responses due: | Thursday, January 9, 2025 (AoE) 
  Notification to authors: | Saturday, January 25, 2025 (AoE) 
  Camera-ready deadline: | Friday, February 28, 2025 (AoE) 

 Two Deadlines  
 EuroSys 2025 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings. In the meantime, authors are permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by EuroSys, for example listing them on CVs.  
 A paper submitted at the spring deadline for EuroSys 2025 and rejected may not be submitted again until the spring deadline for EuroSys 2026. A paper submitted at the fall deadline for EuroSys 2025 and rejected may not be submitted again until the fall deadline for EuroSys 2026.  
 Revision  
 Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. If offered a revision option, authors can choose to revise and resubmit the paper for the subsequent EuroSys deadline. This will be the EuroSys 2025 fall deadline if offered a revision from a spring submission. If offered a revision from the fall submission, authors may revise and resubmit to the subsequent (EuroSys 2026) spring deadline for publication (if accepted) and presentation at EuroSys 2026.  
 Authors offered a revision option will be given detailed instructions about how to re-submit. These will include the list of necessary changes for the paper to be accepted. These may include larger changes than during the shepherding process for accepted papers, e.g. additional results or performance comparisons that match the message of the paper. The re-submission should include the revised paper, a version of the paper in which the differences from the first submission are clearly marked, and a separate high-level summary of the differences between the two versions.  
 A revision option is not a guarantee of acceptance. The revised and resubmitted paper will be re-evaluated by the PC. The paper can still be rejected if the revision instructions have not been fully addressed; if new assertions are made without adequate support; or if the revised version unveils significant new concerns that were hidden in the original submission. Revised and resubmitted papers will receive either an accept or a reject decision; there will be no further revision options offered. If accepted, the paper will be subject to the usual shepherding of EuroSys.  
  Note  : at least one full registration  fee (member or non-member) will be required for each  paper accepted at the plenary conference, even if the presenter is eligible for a student fee.  
  Resubmission and concurrent submission  
 Authors submitting to EuroSys must adhere to ACM's policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  . If a revision option is offered and accepted, the paper is still considered under submission to EuroSys and still subject to this policy until it is explicitly withdrawn or rejected. If a revision option is offered and declined, the same policy applies as for a rejection.  
 If a paper initially submitted to the spring deadline of EuroSys 2025 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the fall deadline of EuroSys 2026. If a paper initially submitted to the fall deadline of EuroSys 2025 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the spring deadline of EuroSys 2027.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Spring Submission URL:  https://eurosys25.hotcrp.com/   
 Fall Submission URL:  https://eurosys25-fall.hotcrp.com/   
 Anonymity  : Reviewing is double-blind, meaning that the authors‘ identities will be hidden from the reviewers and vice versa. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments).  
 Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say “Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Smith et al. [17]”.  
 A submission may extend a previous workshop paper, or it may relate to a submission currently under review. In these cases, you must still explain the differences between your present submission and the other work, but you should cite the other work anonymously and submit the anonymized work in a designated field in hotcrp (visible only to the PC chairs).  
 Authors are permitted to post drafts of their submission on e.g. arxiv or as technical reports on their institution’s website. However, the submitted version should have a substantially different title, and a different system/tool name (if it uses one) from the draft version.  
 Authors are welcome to include links to code repositories in their papers. However, authors should ensure that following the link and exploring the repository does not reveal any information about the names of the authors or their affiliations.  
 Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review. EuroSys applies ACM‘s policies for plagiarism conflicts of interest, submission confidentiality, reviewer anonymity, and prior and concurrent paper submission. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, whether or not your submissions meet these guidelines, or have specific questions about the guidelines, please contact the program co-chairs, eurosys25-pc-chairs@eurosys.org  , well in advance of the submission deadline.  
 Benchmarking:  Please review your submissions to avoid the list of Systems Benchmarking Crimes (https://gernot-heiser.org/benchmarking-crimes.html)  .  
 Generative AI:  Please review the ACM Policy on Authorship (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)  which contains information on the use of generative AI in preparing submissions.  
 Conflicts  : When registering and submitting your paper, you will need to provide information about conflicts with PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:  
 Institution | : You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution. 
  Advisor or Collaboration | : You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee, or you have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (2022 or later), or reasonably expect one within the next year. 
   
 A textbox will be provided on the submission page to explain any concerns about conflicts of interest. More details on the conflict of interest policy can be found at the ACM website  .  
 The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts will be removed. Improperly identifying PC members as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having an individual review your paper may lead to the submission being rejected without review. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program chairs ( eurosys25-pc-chairs@eurosys.org  ).  
 Page limit and formatting  : Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, appendices, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. In addition, submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for supplementary material in a separate file, which can be uploaded at a separate place on the submission site. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material, but authors may use this space for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material or appendices included in the paper when reviewing the submission.  
 Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by ≥8 mm (0.33″) of whitespace. Use ≥10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on ≥12-point (single-spaced) leading for all text including figure and table captions. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without magnification. All pages should be numbered. Authors are encouraged to hyperlink their references.  
 Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN Latex (\documentclass[sigplan, … ]) or MS Word templates from here  . For any paper parameters not defined above, assume that the required value is the one used in these templates.  
 Papers that deviate significantly from the formatting instructions will be administratively rejected.  
 For Latex, we recommend you use (where <PAPER_ID> is the paper ID you received after abstract registration):  
 \documentclass[sigplan,twocolumn,review,anonymous]{acmart} \acmSubmissionID{<PAPER ID>} \renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{} % Optional: Remove the ACM reference between the abstract and the main text. \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printacmref=false} % Optional: Comment out the CCS concepts and keywords. ...  Revision submissions  
 If you are submitting a revised paper because you received a revise-and-resubmit decision from the previous deadline, you should already have received instructions by e-mail on how to prepare the revision submission. At submission time please tick the appropriate box in HotCRP for the fall submission, and also provide the required additional information (spring submission paper #, supplemental material, and summary of revision).  
 Author response  
 Author responses will be strictly limited to 1000 words. Providing a response in a pdf file (in which the number of words is not easy to detect) or inlining documents such as revised figures into the response will result in the response being removed. Accepted papers and artifact evaluation  
 Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors are encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process.

 SCOPE  
  ==============================================  
 The main focus of EOMAS is on the role, importance, and application of modeling and simulation within the extended organizational and enterprise context. This context implies that systems and software applications are designed to enable certain business processes, and to facilitate interaction of the actors, the system, and the environment. Thus, application of modeling and simulation in this extended context involves several number of socio-technical aspects (Information Systems (IS), Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), Software Systems, and Business Systems, Business Processes, Human Interaction, etc.), as well as technical challenges such as security, big data, and approaches to develop these artifacts such as Agile methods and frameworks etc.  
 SUGGESTED TOPICS  
  ==============================================  
 Enterprise Modeling and Simulation 
  Information Systems Modeling and Simulation 
  Business Processes Modeling and Simulation 
  Organizational Modeling and Simulation 
  Ontological and Conceptual Modeling 
  Domain-specific Modeling and Languages 
  Business Rules and Constrain Modeling 
  Modeling and Simulation Methods, Techniques, and Tools 
  Modeling and Simulation Tools Demonstration

 Welcome to EuroVis 2025   
   
 The 27th edition of EuroVis will take place in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, and will be hosted by the Visualization and Interaction Group (VISINT) of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).   
 EuroVis is the premier annual conference organized by the Eurographics Working Group on Data Visualization  .  
 Since its inception in 1999 as a symposium, and its elevation to a full conference in 2012, EuroVis has grown to become one of the leading platforms for advancing visualization research and applications across Europe.  
 As a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, visualization plays a critical role in addressing one of today’s most pressing challenges: transforming vast amounts of raw data into meaningful insights. While data collection and storage capabilities have advanced exponentially, our capacity to derive actionable knowledge from this information lags behind. Visualization bridges this gap by utilizing the power of the human visual system, combined with advanced computer graphics, to offer intuitive exploration, analysis, and communication of complex data.  
 EuroVis 2025 aims to foster collaboration between visualization researchers and practitioners from across disciplines. The conference provides a unique platform for sharing groundbreaking research, building networks, and inspiring new research directions. With its broadened scope to encompass all areas of data visualization, EuroVis continues to expand its impact both within Europe and globally.  
 The main conference will be preceded by a series of co-located workshops and events, which will be held on June 2, 2025, at the same venue.  
 Join us for an enriching and inspiring experience in the heart of Luxembourg City!

 Publisher Description   

 This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Enterprise and Organizational Modeling and Simulation, EOMAS 2015, held at CAiSE 2015, in June 2015 in Stockholm, Sweden. EOMAS was founded with the purpose to become a forum among researchers and practitioners to share their research and practical findings by encouraging the dissemination of research results under a more generic umbrella called enterprise engineering, which encompasses internal factors ranging from organizational complexity to intricacy of business processes and sophistication in workflows as well as external factors and uncertainties such as competition, politics, or the emergence of innovative technologies. The 15 papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 28 submissions. They were organized in topical sections named: enterprise conceptual modeling and simulation; enterprise modeling formal foundation; and enterprise optimization.

 EuroVA 2024  
 Workshop   
 EuroVA 2024 ( eurova.org/eurova-2024  ) is the fourteenth international EuroVis Workshop on Visual Analytics.  
 It will take place on Monday, May 27, 2024, in Odense, Denmark, and is co-located with Eurovis 2024, the Eurographics Conference on Visualization ( eurovis.org  ).  
 Visual Analytics is a problem-solving and sense-making approach that integrates analytical computations, visual representations, and interaction. It includes the analysis of complex (massive, heterogeneous, dynamic, uncertain, …) data and information for gaining understanding, building knowledge, and inferring insight. Visual Analytics aims at a synergistic collaboration of humans and computers mediated through interactive visual interfaces. As such, Visual Analytics is an interdisciplinary field of research, including aspects of visualization, human-computer interaction, data science, statistics and mathematics, data management and knowledge representation, data analysis and machine learning, cognitive and perceptual sciences.  
 EuroVA 2024 is the premier workshop in Europe to present and discuss fresh ideas on new methods and theories, novel applications, designs, and studies on the use of Visual Analytics methods and systems. The workshop will accept a wide range of contributions within the broad area of Visual Analytics, including novel techniques, systems, applications, evaluation studies and methods, and theoretical foundations, as well as fresh viewpoints on future challenges and critical reflections.  
  EuroVA proceedings will be published in the EG Digital Library  . EuroVA is also indexed in dblp  and Scopus.  
 Workshop Program  
 Program 2024

 USEFLULL INFORMATIONS & GUIDELINES   
   
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS   
 The maximum length for submitted papers to the full papers track is 10 pages (in Computer Graphics Forum (CGF) style, including all images and acknowledgements, but excluding references).  
 References should not exceed 2 pages. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. Papers exceeding the maximum allowed number of pages will be automatically rejected.  
 Submissions must be made using the Computer Graphics Forum style, using the conference LaTeX template for full papers https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip  ) which includes a sample document explaining the required format LaTeX2e Style template.  
 Authors have the option to submit their papers anonymously. In contrast to previous years, double-blind reviewing is optional, not required: authors may choose to disclose their identities to the reviewers. The reviewing process does not consider anonymity as a factor. The process will attempt to preserve anonymity of authors of anonymized submissions. However, the program committee, which is responsible for half of the reviews, will know the authors of submissions reviewed by them. This is required for selecting reviewers without conflict of interests. Please take note that submissions may be checked for plagiarism.  
 Authors have the option of submitting additional material with their submissions. Supplementary materials, such as videos and supporting data, are encouraged. For papers that have previously been reviewed for other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are strongly encouraged to provide the original submission with a cover letter describing the changes they have made to comply with reviewers' comments and requests.  
 All full papers accepted to EuroVis appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics digital library.  
 EuroVis submissions and papers are subject to the pre-print and self-archiving policies of the Computer Graphics Forum journal. Details are available from the journal web site:  
 https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/preprints-policy.html   

 PLAN S COMPLIANCE   
 EuroVis publishes all its material in the Eurographics Digital Library, and some material also in cooperation with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum (Full Papers, STAR Reports). The Eurographics Publication Board, Eurovis Steering Committee, and Eurovis Full Paper Chairs are aware of these questions, and state the following:  
 Publishing in the Eurographics Digital Library is Plan-S compliant. 
  Publishing with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum is Plan-S compliant in many cases, due to so-called transformational agreements between Wiley and national funding agencies and/or universities. In case of questions for clarification, please contact plan-S@eurovis.org and we will help to find a solution. We look forward very much to receiving your work for EuroVis

 Submissions must be made using the Computer Graphics Forum style, using the conference LaTeX template for full papers https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip  ) which includes a sample document explaining the required format LaTeX2e Style template.  
 Authors have the option to submit their papers anonymously. In contrast to previous years, double-blind reviewing is optional, not required: authors may choose to disclose their identities to the reviewers. The reviewing process does not consider anonymity as a factor. The process will attempt to preserve anonymity of authors of anonymized submissions. However, the program committee, which is responsible for half of the reviews, will know the authors of submissions reviewed by them. This is required for selecting reviewers without conflict of interests. Please take note that submissions may be checked for plagiarism.  
 Authors have the option of submitting additional material with their submissions. Supplementary materials, such as videos and supporting data, are encouraged. For papers that have previously been reviewed for other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are strongly encouraged to provide the original submission with a cover letter describing the changes they have made to comply with reviewers' comments and requests.  
 All full papers accepted to EuroVis appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics digital library.  
 EuroVis submissions and papers are subject to the pre-print and self-archiving policies of the Computer Graphics Forum journal. Details are available from the journal web site:  
 https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/preprints-policy.html   

 PLAN S COMPLIANCE   
 EuroVis publishes all its material in the Eurographics Digital Library, and some material also in cooperation with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum (Full Papers, STAR Reports). The Eurographics Publication Board, Eurovis Steering Committee, and Eurovis Full Paper Chairs are aware of these questions, and state the following:  
 Publishing in the Eurographics Digital Library is Plan-S compliant. 
  Publishing with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum is Plan-S compliant in many cases, due to so-called transformational agreements between Wiley and national funding agencies and/or universities. In case of questions for clarification, please contact plan-S@eurovis.org and we will help to find a solution. We look forward very much to receiving your work for EuroVis  

 USAGE OF AI   
 The use of generative AI tools is prohibited for authors to generate their text. The only use is allowed for grammar/English corrections or rephrasing.  

 SUBMISSION PLATFORM: PCS   
 Abstracts and full papers are submitted using the Precision Conference System (PCS):   
 https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions   
 Please select Society: Eurographics, Conference/Journal: EuroVis 2025, Track: EuroVis 2025 Papers.  

 DEADLINE   
 Submission of an abstract is mandatory by the abstract deadline  , with completed papers due on by the full paper deadline. Submissions will not be accepted if an abstract is not submitted by the abstract deadline. Abstract submissions require the title, authors, paper type, abstract, and keywords in the form. The paper title and authors may not be changed after the abstract deadline. The remaining fields (the document, additional material) are submitted by the full paper deadline. Please note that EuroVis accepted full papers are published as a regular-length journal article, so submitting just an abstract is not sufficient. Submitters need to choose keywords and categories appropriate for their paper as this information is used in reviewer selection

 Call for Papers  
 EuroSys 2025 will adopt a dual-deadline format -- dates for both deadlines are shown below. Accepted papers from both deadlines will be presented at EuroSys 2025  
 The European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys) is a premier international forum for presenting computer systems research. This 20th edition of EuroSys will be jointly organized with ASPLOS 2025   . I.e. the conferences will be co-located and there will be a shared registration fee. To find out more about submitting a paper to ASPLOS 2025, please refer to their website  .  
 EuroSys 2025 seeks papers on all areas of computer systems research, including:  
 Operating systems 
  Distributed systems 
  Cloud computing and datacenter systems 
  File and storage systems 
  Networked systems 
  Language support and runtime systems 
  Systems security and privacy 
  Dependable systems 
  Analysis, testing and verification of systems 
  Database systems and data analytics frameworks 
  Virtualization and virtualized systems 
  Systems for machine learning/machine learning for systems 
  Mobile and pervasive systems 
  Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems 
  Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems 
  Systems for emerging hardware 
   
 We encourage papers that span multiple topics and communities. Papers will be judged on novelty, significance correctness, and clarity. The program committee seeks papers that address a significant problem with an interesting and compelling solution whose validity and practicality are clearly demonstrated. A good paper will draw appropriate conclusions, honestly present related prior work, acknowledge its own limitations and clearly articulate the advances it offers over prior work.  
 Important dates  
  EuroSys 2025 will adopt a dual-deadline format. Deadline dates for the two submission periods are shown below. Accepted papers from both submission periods will be presented at EuroSys 2025. All deadlines are AoE time   .  
 Spring deadline  
 Paper titles and abstracts due: | Tuesday May 14, 2024 (AoE) 
  Full paper submissions due: | Tuesday, May 21, 2024 (AoE) 
  Reviews available: | Wednesday, July 31, 2024 (AoE) 
  Author responses due: | Friday, August 2, 2024 (AoE)

  Full paper submissions due: | Tuesday, October 22, 2024 (AoE) 
  Reviews available: | Tuesday, January 7, 2025 (AoE) 
  Author responses due: | Thursday, January 9, 2025 (AoE) 
  Notification to authors: | Saturday, January 25, 2025 (AoE) 
  Camera-ready deadline: | Friday, February 28, 2025 (AoE) 

 Two Deadlines  
 EuroSys 2025 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings. In the meantime, authors are permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by EuroSys, for example listing them on CVs.  
 A paper submitted at the spring deadline for EuroSys 2025 and rejected may not be submitted again until the spring deadline for EuroSys 2026. A paper submitted at the fall deadline for EuroSys 2025 and rejected may not be submitted again until the fall deadline for EuroSys 2026.  
 Revision  
 Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. If offered a revision option, authors can choose to revise and resubmit the paper for the subsequent EuroSys deadline. This will be the EuroSys 2025 fall deadline if offered a revision from a spring submission. If offered a revision from the fall submission, authors may revise and resubmit to the subsequent (EuroSys 2026) spring deadline for publication (if accepted) and presentation at EuroSys 2026.  
 Authors offered a revision option will be given detailed instructions about how to re-submit. These will include the list of necessary changes for the paper to be accepted. These may include larger changes than during the shepherding process for accepted papers, e.g. additional results or performance comparisons that match the message of the paper. The re-submission should include the revised paper, a version of the paper in which the differences from the first submission are clearly marked, and a separate high-level summary of the differences between the two versions.  
 A revision option is not a guarantee of acceptance. The revised and resubmitted paper will be re-evaluated by the PC. The paper can still be rejected if the revision instructions have not been fully addressed; if new assertions are made without adequate support; or if the revised version unveils significant new concerns that were hidden in the original submission. Revised and resubmitted papers will receive either an accept or a reject decision; there will be no further revision options offered. If accepted, the paper will be subject to the usual shepherding of EuroSys.  
  Note  : at least one full registration  fee (member or non-member) will be required for each  paper accepted at the plenary conference, even if the presenter is eligible for a student fee.  
  Resubmission and concurrent submission  
 Authors submitting to EuroSys must adhere to ACM's policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  . If a revision option is offered and accepted, the paper is still considered under submission to EuroSys and still subject to this policy until it is explicitly withdrawn or rejected. If a revision option is offered and declined, the same policy applies as for a rejection.  
 If a paper initially submitted to the spring deadline of EuroSys 2025 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the fall deadline of EuroSys 2026. If a paper initially submitted to the fall deadline of EuroSys 2025 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the spring deadline of EuroSys 2027.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Spring Submission URL:  https://eurosys25.hotcrp.com/   
 Fall Submission URL:  https://eurosys25-fall.hotcrp.com/   
 Anonymity  : Reviewing is double-blind, meaning that the authors‘ identities will be hidden from the reviewers and vice versa. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments).  
 Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say “Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Smith et al. [17]”.  
 A submission may extend a previous workshop paper, or it may relate to a submission currently under review. In these cases, you must still explain the differences between your present submission and the other work, but you should cite the other work anonymously and submit the anonymized work in a designated field in hotcrp (visible only to the PC chairs).  
 Authors are permitted to post drafts of their submission on e.g. arxiv or as technical reports on their institution’s website. However, the submitted version should have a substantially different title, and a different system/tool name (if it uses one) from the draft version.  
 Authors are welcome to include links to code repositories in their papers. However, authors should ensure that following the link and exploring the repository does not reveal any information about the names of the authors or their affiliations.  
 Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review. EuroSys applies ACM‘s policies for plagiarism conflicts of interest, submission confidentiality, reviewer anonymity, and prior and concurrent paper submission. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, whether or not your submissions meet these guidelines, or have specific questions about the guidelines, please contact the program co-chairs, eurosys25-pc-chairs@eurosys.org  , well in advance of the submission deadline.  
 Benchmarking:  Please review your submissions to avoid the list of Systems Benchmarking Crimes (https://gernot-heiser.org/benchmarking-crimes.html)  .  
 Generative AI:  Please review the ACM Policy on Authorship (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)  which contains information on the use of generative AI in preparing submissions.  
 Conflicts  : When registering and submitting your paper, you will need to provide information about conflicts with PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:  
 Institution | : You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution. 
  Advisor or Collaboration | : You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee, or you have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (2022 or later), or reasonably expect one within the next year. 
   
 A textbox will be provided on the submission page to explain any concerns about conflicts of interest. More details on the conflict of interest policy can be found at the ACM website  .  
 The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts will be removed. Improperly identifying PC members as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having an individual review your paper may lead to the submission being rejected without review. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program chairs ( eurosys25-pc-chairs@eurosys.org  ).  
 Page limit and formatting  : Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, appendices, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. In addition, submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for supplementary material in a separate file, which can be uploaded at a separate place on the submission site. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material, but authors may use this space for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material or appendices included in the paper when reviewing the submission.  
 Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by ≥8 mm (0.33″) of whitespace. Use ≥10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on ≥12-point (single-spaced) leading for all text including figure and table captions. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without magnification. All pages should be numbered. Authors are encouraged to hyperlink their references.  
 Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN Latex (\documentclass[sigplan, … ]) or MS Word templates from here  . For any paper parameters not defined above, assume that the required value is the one used in these templates.  
 Papers that deviate significantly from the formatting instructions will be administratively rejected.  
 For Latex, we recommend you use (where <PAPER_ID> is the paper ID you received after abstract registration):  
 \documentclass[sigplan,twocolumn,review,anonymous]{acmart} \acmSubmissionID{<PAPER ID>} \renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{} % Optional: Remove the ACM reference between the abstract and the main text. \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printacmref=false} % Optional: Comment out the CCS concepts and keywords. ...  Revision submissions  
 If you are submitting a revised paper because you received a revise-and-resubmit decision from the previous deadline, you should already have received instructions by e-mail on how to prepare the revision submission. At submission time please tick the appropriate box in HotCRP for the fall submission, and also provide the required additional information (spring submission paper #, supplemental material, and summary of revision).  
 Author response  
 Author responses will be strictly limited to 1000 words. Providing a response in a pdf file (in which the number of words is not easy to detect) or inlining documents such as revised figures into the response will result in the response being removed. Accepted papers and artifact evaluation  
 Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors are encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process.

  STARs 

 State-of-the-Art Reports (STARs)   
   
 State-of-the-Art Reports (STARs) are intended to provide up-to-date and comprehensive surveys on topics of interest to the visualization research community. We encourage the submission of STARs on topics that have not yet been covered in any recent STAR or other survey [1].  
 We welcome submissions that introduce emerging areas of research that are of relevance and interest to visualization research, as well as proposals on more traditional visualization topics. We also welcome contributions from related disciplines and application areas demonstrating contributions to, or benefits from, the area of visualization including, but not limited to, visual computing, computer graphics, human-computer interaction, virtual reality, image processing, computer vision, psychology, geography, chemistry, computational fluid dynamics, data analysis, computational sciences, medicine, biology, economy, social science, etc. All accepted EuroVis STAR reports will be published in the Computer Graphics Forum journal   .

 USEFULL INFORMATIONS & GUIDELINES   
   
 INSTRUCTIONS   
 As part of the acceptance process for Computer Graphics Forum, STARs will undergo a multi-stage review process  where authors first submit a 2-page STAR Sketch that they receive preliminary feedback on, followed by a full STAR submission. Submission of the STAR Sketch and full report is mandatory and will be conducted using the Precision Conference System ( PCS  ). For detailed paper preparation and submission instructions please refer to the submission guidelines  below.  
 Upon acceptance, we aim to schedule each STAR as an approximately 45 minute presentation (subject to the schedule management of the EuroVis 2025 program). In any circumstance, a STAR presentation will be given a longer time slot than that of a full paper.  

 STAR SKETCH SUBMISSION   
 A STAR Sketch briefly describes the planned STAR by outlining the topic, discussing its relevance to the visualization community, providing the planned structure and outline of the STAR together with all key references, and short biographies of the authors. The length of a STAR Sketch main text is limited to two pages  . To demonstrate the relevant expertise needed to produce the proposed STAR, brief biographies of all authors are required as supplementary material. References and short biographies are considered supplementary pages and are not counted within the two page limit. Authors receive feedback on their sketches to help improve the submission and to inform their decisions whether to progress to the Full STAR submission stage.  

 FULL STAR SUBMISSION   
 In the next stage, authors are required to submit a full STAR. There is no strict maximum length for full submissions. However, it is unusual for STARs to exceed 20 pages (excluding references). Full STAR submissions will then undergo a single blind, two-stage review process, similar to that of regular papers submitted to Computer Graphics Forum, where 3-4 external experts on the respective topic will evaluate the STAR.  

 STAR CHAIRS   
 Marco Angelini,  University of Rome, Italy  
 Christoph Garth,  University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, Germany  
 Andreas Kerren,  Linköping University, Sweden  
 For any questions concerning State-of-the-Art Report submissions, please contact the STAR chairs at stars@eurovis.org   

 SUBMISSION GUIDELINES   
 Since all accepted STARs will be published in Computer Graphics Forum, the submission process uses a multiple-stage reviewing process. The submission procedure is as follows:  
 Submit a STAR Sketch by | October 14th, 2024. | The length of a STAR Sketch main text is limited to | 2 pages | . 
  References and short biographies are considered supplementary pages and are not counted within the two-page limit. The format of the sketch should follow the format specified in the formatting instructions for the STAR below. STAR Sketches will be reviewed by the STAR IPC and comments on suitability and relevance will be provided on November 4th, 2024  .  
 According to the feedback given by the IPC members, the authors can submit a full STAR by | January 13th, 2025 | . 
  The requirements for EuroVis 2025 STARs follow the EUROGRAPHICS policy on STAR length. We do not impose strict maximum lengths for submitted STARs.  However, it is unusual for STARs to exceed 20 pages  (in CGF latex style) including all figures and tables, but excluding references  . There is no limit as to the number of references or the number of pages for references. STARs should only be as long as their content justifies. Reviewers might rate a submission lower if it is perceived as being unnecessarily long. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. To submit, please go to “submissions in progress” on PCS   .  
 Full STAR submissions will then undergo a single blind, two-stage review process, similar to that of regular papers submitted to Computer Graphics Forum, where 3-4 external experts on the respective topic will evaluate the STAR.  
 Once your full STAR submission has been accepted or conditionally accepted, submit your revised version together with a cover letter detailing your changes by March 31th, 2025  . To do so, please go to “submissions in progress” in PCS   . The camera-ready version is due on April 28nd, 2025.   

 FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS   
 The sketch as well as the full version submission of the STAR should be submitted as a PDF file using the EuroVis 2025 LaTeX2e Style template. The template can be downloaded here  .  On Overleaf, this template can be imported easily by selecting “New Project” -> “Upload Project” and uploading the zip file. Use EGauthorGuidelines-eurovis25-star.tex  for your submission.  
 Please make sure that images embedded in your paper do not contain transparent pixels (i.e., an alpha channel of a transparent color), because this will lead to problems when the resulting PDF is displayed or printed.  
 Submissions can also include supplementary material such as videos or executable programs. The server will accept uploads of at most 200 MB, so multiple files of over 200 MB must be submitted separately. Please use only the most common video codecs (e.g., MP4 format using the H.264 codec) to maximize the chances that the reviewers can see it.  
 STAR Sketches and full STARs are submitted using the Precision Conference Submission System ( PCS   ).  

 CAMERA READY VERSION   
 In order to submit the camera ready version to EuroVis 2025, authors should prepare their submissions as a PDF file using the EuroVis 2025 LaTeX2e Style. Please ensure that the option \SpecialIssuePaper is used.  
 Authors of accepted papers are also requested to fill in the Exclusive License Agreement   (one per paper) and send the signed document to s.behnke@eg.org.  
 Common mistakes when creating the final version of the paper are:  
 Headlines are too long: | besides the running headlines, there has to be space for the page numbers. Please shorten the headline to accommodate for page numbers. 
  Formatting of figure captions: | “ | Figure <number>: | ” should be bold, and the caption should be set in italics. This is often caused by overwriting the default settings when using the figure, caption, or subfigure packages. Try using: \captionsetup{labelfont=bf,textfont=it}) 

 AUTHOR GUIDELINES   
 A state-of-the-art report submitted to EuroVis 2025 must be original, unpublished work. Any work that has previously been published or has simultaneously been submitted in a substantially similar form to any other conference or journal will be rejected.  
 All STARs accepted to EuroVis 2025 appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics Digital Library.  
 At EuroVis 2025, the authors of a STAR will be invited to present their report at a level that also allows non-experts in the particular domain to follow. We plan to schedule each STAR as an approximate 45-minute presentation (subject to the schedule management of the EuroVis 2025 program, but ensuring that STAR presentations will be given a longer time slot than those of full papers). At least one author of an accepted paper must register and attend the conference to present the work, and authors “ will also be required to submit a 25-second video preview(TBC)”   summarizing their work and eventually present a brief (less than one-minute) summary of their talk at the opening papers preview session (also called papers fast-forward).  
 Contributions must be written and presented in English.

 USEFLULL INFORMATIONS & GUIDELINES   
   
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS   
 The maximum length for submitted papers to the full papers track is 10 pages (in Computer Graphics Forum (CGF) style, including all images and acknowledgements, but excluding references).  
 References should not exceed 2 pages. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. Papers exceeding the maximum allowed number of pages will be automatically rejected.  
 Submissions must be made using the Computer Graphics Forum style, using the conference LaTeX template for full papers https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip  ) which includes a sample document explaining the required format LaTeX2e Style template.  
 Authors have the option to submit their papers anonymously. In contrast to previous years, double-blind reviewing is optional, not required: authors may choose to disclose their identities to the reviewers. The reviewing process does not consider anonymity as a factor. The process will attempt to preserve anonymity of authors of anonymized submissions. However, the program committee, which is responsible for half of the reviews, will know the authors of submissions reviewed by them. This is required for selecting reviewers without conflict of interests. Please take note that submissions may be checked for plagiarism.  
 Authors have the option of submitting additional material with their submissions. Supplementary materials, such as videos and supporting data, are encouraged. For papers that have previously been reviewed for other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are strongly encouraged to provide the original submission with a cover letter describing the changes they have made to comply with reviewers' comments and requests.  
 All full papers accepted to EuroVis appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics digital library.  
 EuroVis submissions and papers are subject to the pre-print and self-archiving policies of the Computer Graphics Forum journal. Details are available from the journal web site:  
 https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/preprints-policy.html   

 PLAN S COMPLIANCE   
 EuroVis publishes all its material in the Eurographics Digital Library, and some material also in cooperation with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum (Full Papers, STAR Reports). The Eurographics Publication Board, Eurovis Steering Committee, and Eurovis Full Paper Chairs are aware of these questions, and state the following:  
 Publishing in the Eurographics Digital Library is Plan-S compliant. 
  Publishing with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum is Plan-S compliant in many cases, due to so-called transformational agreements between Wiley and national funding agencies and/or universities. In case of questions for clarification, please contact plan-S@eurovis.org and we will help to find a solution. We look forward very much to receiving your work for EuroVis  

 USAGE OF AI   
 The use of generative AI tools is prohibited for authors to generate their text. The only use is allowed for grammar/English corrections or rephrasing.  

 SUBMISSION PLATFORM: PCS

 EuroVA 2022  
 Special: call for your questions about Visual Analytics  , to be discussed in a special session at EuroVA2022!  
 Workshop  
 EuroVA 2022 is the 13th international EuroVis Workshop on Visual Analytics.  
 It will take place on Monday, June 13, 2022  , in Rome, Italy, and is co-located with Eurovis 2022, the Eurographics Conference on Visualization ( https://www.eurovis.org/  ).  
 Visual Analytics is a problem-solving and sense-making approach that integrates analytical computations, visual representations, and interaction. It includes the analysis of complex (massive, heterogeneous, dynamic, uncertain, …) data and information for gaining understanding, building knowledge, and inferring insight. Visual Analytics aims at a synergistic collaboration of humans and computers mediated through interactive visual interfaces. As such, Visual Analytics is an interdisciplinary field of research, including aspects of visualization, human-computer interaction, data science, statistics and mathematics, data management and knowledge representation, data analysis and machine learning, and cognitive and perceptual sciences.  
 EuroVA 2022 is the premier workshop in Europe to present and discuss fresh ideas on new methods and theories, novel applications, designs, and studies on the use of Visual Analytics methods and systems. The workshop will accept a wide range of contributions within the broad area of Visual Analytics, including novel techniques, systems, applications, evaluation studies and methods, and theoretical foundations, as well as fresh viewpoints on future challenges and critical reflections.

 Leuven  is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in Belgium. It is located about 25 kilometres (16 miles) east of Brussels. It is the 10th largest municipality in Belgium and the fourth in Flanders. Leuven is home to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence. The related university hospital of UZ Leuven, is one of the largest hospitals of Europe. The city is also known for being the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and one of the five largest consumer-goods companies in the world.  
 Leuven's Town Hall is one of the best-known Gothic town halls worldwide and Leuven's pride and joy. It took three architects and thirty years to build it. Leuven's 'Hall of Fame' features 236 statues, which were only added to the façade after 1850. There are 220 men and 16 women in total. On the bottom floor are famous Leuven scientists, artists and historical figures, dressed in Burgundian garb. The first floor is reserved for the patron saints of the various parishes of Leuven. Above them the façade is adorned by the counts and dukes of Brabant while the towers primarily feature biblical figures.

   The 25th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers working on applications and theory of evolutionary computation methods and other metaheuristics for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and scientific domains.  
 Successfully solved problems include, but are not limited to, multi-objective, uncertain, dynamic and stochastic problems in the context of scheduling, timetabling, network design, transportation and distribution, vehicle routing, stringology, graphs, satisfiability, energy optimisation, cutting, packing, planning and search-based software engineering.  
 Successfully addressed theoretical and translational challenges encompass, but are not limited to, the development and analysis of novel (components of) evolutionary and other metaheuristic algorithms, work on neighbourhood and landscape structures, problem-agnostic and problem-specific variation operators, parallelisation strategies, and hybridizations. ⁠  
 The EvoCOP 2025 conference will be held together with EuroGP (the 28th European Conference on Genetic Programming), EvoMUSART (the 14th European conference on evolutionary and biologically inspired music, sound, art and design) and EvoApplications (the 28th European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation), in a joint event collectively known as EvoStar (Evo*).  
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Previous proceedings can be found in the EvoCOP Conference Proceedings in SpringerLink  .  
 Download the CFP in PDF here  .  
 Areas of Interest and Contributions   
 EvoCOP welcomes submissions in all experimental and theoretical aspects of evolutionary computation and other metaheuristics to combinatorial optimisation problems, including (but not limited to) the following areas:  
 Applications of metaheuristics to combinatorial optimization problems 
  Theoretical developments 
  Neighbourhoods and efficient algorithms for searching them 
  Variation operators for stochastic search methods 
  Constraint-handling techniques 
  Parallelisation and grid computing 
  Search space and landscape analyses 
  Comparisons between different (also exact) methods 
  Automatic algorithm configuration and design 
  Prominent examples of metaheuristics include (but are not limited to):  
 Evolutionary algorithms 
  Estimation of distribution algorithms 
  Swarm intelligence methods such as ant colony and particle swarm optimisation 
  Artificial immune systems 
  Local search methods such as simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search, iterated local search, scatter search and path relinking 
  Hybrid methods such as memetic algorithms 
  Matheuristics (hybrids of exact and heuristic methods) 
  Hyper-heuristics and autonomous search 
  Surrogate-model-based methods 
  Notice that, by tradition, continuous/numerical optimisation is *not* part of the topics of interest of EvoCOP. Interested authors might consider submitting to other EvoStar conferences such as EvoApplications.  
 Conference Chairs  
 Markus Wagner | Monash University, Australia | markus.wagner(at)monash.edu

  Submission Details  
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. They will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper  .  
 Page limit  : 14 + unlimited references pages OR 6 + unlimited references pages  
 If your paper has at most 6 pages of content (plus additional pages for references), then we consider it a short paper. If your paper has between 7 and 14 pages of content (plus additional pages for references), then we consider it as a full paper. In case of acceptance, a short paper will get a shorter time slot for presentation at EvoCOP than a full paper; exact durations are yet to be decided.  
 Follow these instructions  to submit a paper.

   The 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Music, Sound, Art and Design (EvoMUSART) 2025 is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers who are working on the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques in creative and artistic fields.  
 There is a growing interest in the application of Artificial Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computation, Swarm Intelligence, Cellular Automata, Alife, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques in fields such as: visual art and music generation, analysis, and interpretation; sound synthesis; architecture; video; poetry; design; and other creative tasks. Therefore, the use of Artificial Intelligence in such creative domains became a significant and exciting area of research. EvoMUSART provides the opportunity to present, discuss and promote innovative contributions and ongoing work in the area.  
 Following the success of previous events and the importance of the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to music, sound, art and design, EvoMUSART has been an evo* conference with independent proceedings since 2012. The EvoMUSART proceedings  have been published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

 Call for EvoApplications Special Sessions  
  
 EvoApplications, the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation, invites you to submit a special session proposal to be part of its 28th edition. Special sessions are at the heart of EvoApplications, offering the possibility to gather the community around a particular aspect or application domain of Evolutionary Computation with the aim of fostering and strengthening scientific collaborations and exchanges among attendees.  
 Special session organizers should do their best to publicize and attract high-quality papers to their sessions. They will also be granted permission to access the reviewing system, where they will assist in the reviewing process. Finally, during the conference, they will be in charge of animating and chairing the special session.  
 EvoApplications provides the infrastructure for the website, the submission system as well as a programme committee of experts in different domain areas. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of EvoApplications, published in a volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science. The submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the EvoApplications program committee. Note that organizers and participants must register for the conference.  
 Submission Instruction   
 Each special session proposal should include:  
 A short and descriptive title for the special session. 
  A description of the scope and the topics of interest of the special session (up to 400 words). 
  Name, affiliation and emails of the organizer(s). We encourage proposals with two organizers. Otherwise, please justify the need for more people. 
  The title and authors of two or more tentative papers to be submitted to the special session. 
  Proposals should be submitted by e-mail to the EvoApplications 2025 Conference Chairs:  
 Emma Hart   
  Edinburgh Napier University, UK  
  Email  : E.Hart(at)napier.ac.uk  
 Pablo García-Sánchez  
   University of Granada, Spain  
  Email  : pablogarcia(at)ugr.es  
 Proposal submission deadline:  September 8, 2024  
 Notification of session acceptance:  Proposals will be reviewed as they arrive by the EvoApplications organizing committee. Decisions will be made in a few working days. The acceptance criteria will be based on the quality of the proposal, its interest to the community and the possible degree of overlap with other special sessions already accepted.

   The 24th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers working on applications and theory of evolutionary computation methods and other metaheuristics for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and scientific domains.  
 Successfully solved problems include, but are not limited to, multi-objective, uncertain, dynamic and stochastic problems in the context of scheduling, timetabling, network design, transportation and distribution, vehicle routing, stringology, graphs, satisfiability, energy optimisation, cutting, packing, planning and search-based software engineering.  
 The EvoCOP 2024 conference will be held together with EuroGP (the 27th European Conference on Genetic Programming), EvoMUSART (the 13th European conference on evolutionary and biologically inspired music, sound, art and design) and EvoApplications (the 27th European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation), in a joint event collectively known as EvoStar (Evo*).  
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Previous proceedings can be found in the EvoCOP Conference Proceedings in SpringerLink  .  
 Download the CFP in PDF here  .  
 NEW:  The proceedings of EvoCOP 2024 is available in the following link  .

  Areas of Interest and Contributions   
 EvoCOP welcomes submissions in all experimental and theoretical aspects of evolutionary computation and other metaheuristics to combinatorial optimisation problems, including (but not limited to) the following areas:  
 Applications of metaheuristics to combinatorial optimization problems 
  Theoretical developments 
  Neighbourhoods and efficient algorithms for searching them 
  Variation operators for stochastic search methods 
  Constraint-handling techniques 
  Parallelisation and grid computing 
  Search space and landscape analyses 
  Comparisons between different (also exact) methods 
  Automatic algorithm configuration and design 
  Prominent examples of metaheuristics include (but are not limited to):  
 Evolutionary algorithms 
  Estimation of distribution algorithms 
  Swarm intelligence methods such as ant colony and particle swarm optimisation 
  Artificial immune systems 
  Local search methods such as simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search, iterated local search, scatter search and path relinking 
  Hybrid methods such as memetic algorithms 
  Matheuristics (hybrids of exact and heuristic methods) 
  Hyper-heuristics and autonomous search 
  Surrogate-model-based methods 
  Notice that, by tradition, continuous/numerical optimisation is *not* part of the topics of interest of EvoCOP. Interested authors might consider submitting to other EvoStar conferences such as EvoApplications.

 International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks (EWSN)  

 The International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks is a highly selective, annual forum for presenting research results in the field of networked embedded systems,broadly defined, including for example Wireless Sensor Networks, Internet of Things, or Cyber-Physical Systems. The forum has been established in 2004 as "European Workshop for Wireless Sensor Networks (EWSN)", was renamed to "European Conference on Wireless Sensor Networks (EWSN)" in 2007 to reflect the maturity of the event, and the scope was broadened to "International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks (EWSN)" in 2016 to reflect the broad relevance of technologies covered by the event in multiple domains.

 SUBMISSION DETAILS  
 Any paper submitted to EWSN 2024 must be original (i.e., not previously published) and not currently under review by any other conference or journal. All submissions in scope of EWSN are equally welcome, and all submissions will be evaluated based on the same criteria.  
 The conference will accept two types of papers – Full Papers (max 12 pages) and Short Papers (max 6 pages). All papers should present original research in the scope described above. No submission should have been published, accepted for publication, or be under review by any other venue (including other conferences, workshops, or journals). Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles will be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” in the final proceedings. Note that EWSN 2024 intends to accept a small number of Short Papers to be presented together in a single dedicated session of the conference. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category as part of the review process.  
 EWSN 2024 will use a double-anonymous review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only PC chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed. To promote early dissemination, submission to arXiv (or similar) is allowed, provided cross-citations are not made. I.e.,  
 You MAY post a version of your paper on arxiv that lists the names of the authors within the posted version. 
  You MAY NOT reference this arxiv version of your paper from the paper submitted for review at EWSN (this is one half of the cross-citation restriction). 
  You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN under review paper in the arxiv paper (this is the other half of the cross-citation restriction). 
  You MAY reference the arxiv paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences. 
  You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN under review paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences. 
  Once your paper is accepted, you MAY reference your EWSN paper (you can use "accepted, to appear" until the conference actually happens). 
  Submission will be via HotCRP: https://ewsn24.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline.  
 Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers.  
  Should the program chairs deem this revision to be sufficient, the paper will be considered as a new submission for the summer cycle. Papers submitted to the summer deadline that are deemed by the program chairs to be too similar to a paper rejected from the winter review cycle will be returned without review.  
 Pages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use the ACM templates for convenience (e.g., on Overleaf here  ).  
 All accepted conference and workshop papers, as well as poster, demo, PhD forum, and competition abstracts will be included in the conference proceedings. The proceedings will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries.  
 Generous cash awards sponsored by the Technology Innovation Institute  will be provided to the best paper, best paper runner-up, and the best presentation award.

 Overview  
 The 23rd USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST '25) brings together researchers and practitioners to explore new directions in the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of systems related to storage. The program committee interprets storage-related systems broadly: submissions on low-level storage devices, distributed storage systems, information and data management, as well as other systems interconnected with storage are all of interest. The conference will consist of technical presentations including refereed papers and poster sessions.  
 Topics  
 The topics of interest to FAST are various aspects of systems related to storage. These include and overlap with, but are not limited to, the following topics:  
 Archival systems 
  AI for storage and storage for AI 
  Auditing and provenance 
  Big data, analytics, and data sciences 
  Caching, replication, and consistency 
  Cloud, multi- and hybrid-cloud environments 
  Data deduplication and compression 
  Database storage 
  Distributed and networked storage (wide-area, grid, peer-to-peer) 
  Emerging memory hierarchy design 
  Empirical evaluation 
  Experience with deployed systems 
  File system design 
  Hardware design and prototypes 
  HPC systems, including parallel I/O 
  Key-value and NoSQL storage 
  Management 
  Memory-only storage systems 
  Mobile, personal, embedded, and home storage 
  Networking 
  Novel and emerging storage technologies (e.g., DNA and glass storage) 
  Performance and QoS 
  Power-aware storage architectures 
  RAID and erasure coding 
  Reliability, availability, and disaster tolerance 
  Search and data retrieval 
  Security 
  Submission Instructions  
 Please submit your short and long papers by 11:59 pm PDT on September 17, 2024  , in PDF format via the submission form  . Do not email submissions. There is no separate deadline for abstract submissions.  
 The complete submission must be | no longer than 12 pages for long papers | and | no longer than 6 pages | for short papers, | excluding references. The program committee values conciseness: if you can express an idea in fewer pages than the limit, do so. 
  Supplemental material is optional and may be added (if deemed really necessary) as a single separate PDF file without page limits. However, the reviewers are not required to read or consider such material. All content that should be considered to judge the paper is not supplemental and should be part of the main submitted file. 
  Papers must be typeset on U.S. letter-sized pages in two columns using 10-point Times Roman font on 12-point leading (single-spaced), within a text block 7" wide by 9" deep. 
  Labels, captions, and other text in figures, graphs, and tables must use font sizes that, when printed, do not require magnification to be legible. References must not be set in a smaller font. Submissions that violate these requirements will not be reviewed. Limits will be enforced strictly. No extensions will be given for reformatting. 
  A LaTeX template and style file are available on the | USENIX templates page | . 
  Double-blind policy: Authors must not be identified in the submissions, either explicitly or by implication. To refer to your previous work, consider it as written by a third party. Do not say "reference removed for blind review." Supplemental material must be anonymized. Submissions violating anonymization rules will not be considered for review. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, please contact the program co-chairs, | fast25chairs@usenix.org | , well in advance of the submission deadline. 
  Prior Workshop Paper Policy: If a submission extends a prior workshop paper, please include an anonymized copy of the workshop paper as supplemental material. This should be the same as the published version, with any identifying information removed. 
  Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the | USENIX Conference Submissions Policy | for details. 
  If you are uncertain whether your submission meets USENIX's guidelines, contact the program co-chairs, | fast25chairs@usenix.org | , or the USENIX office, | submissionspolicy@usenix.org | . 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. 
  Submissions should abide by the Conflict Identification guidelines (see below). 
  The program committee and external reviewers will judge papers on technical merit, significance, relevance, and presentation. Research papers on new and unexplored problems are encouraged. A good research paper:  
 addresses a significant problem; 
  presents an interesting, compelling solution; 
  demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of the solution; 
  draws appropriate conclusions using sound experimental methods; 
  clearly describes what the authors have done; and 
  clearly articulates the advances beyond previous work. 
  Program committee members, USENIX, and the broader community generally value a paper more highly if it is accompanied by artifacts not previously available. These artifacts may include traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work.  
 Blind reviewing of all papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees when necessary. Accepted papers will be shepherded by a member of the program committee.  
 Short Papers  
 This year, in addition to long papers (up to 12 pages), FAST also solicits short papers (up to 6 pages long). Just like full-length papers, short papers should describe completed  research where the problem statement proposed solution, and evaluation are all logically complete and conclusions are drawn. While short papers are held to the same high standards as long papers, they tend to comprise smaller contributions that require a shorter description and less analysis than in full papers.  
 We emphasize that papers that describe early-stage research that is not yet fully evaluated are not suitable for this short-paper category.  That is, preliminary or work-in-progress papers generally considered in workshops such as HotStorage do not fall within the scope of short papers.  
 For short papers, the title should be prefixed with "Short Paper: "  , followed by the title. The prefix will not be published in the proceedings and short papers will not be called out as such in the program. Authors must also indicate that they are submitting a short paper by checking the appropriate checkbox on the submission form. The program committee will not accept a full paper on the condition that it is cut down to fit in the short paper page limit, nor will it invite short papers to be extended to full length. Submissions will be considered only in the category in which they are submitted.  
 To see examples of qualified short papers, we encourage authors to browse short papers accepted at prior FAST conferences—from 2012 to 2020. Short papers will be published in the proceedings, and authors will be allocated a shorter speaking slot during the conference.  
 Deployed-Systems Papers  
 In addition to papers that describe original research, FAST also solicits papers that describe real operational systems, including systems currently in production. Such papers should address experience with the practical design implementation, analysis, deployment, or operation of such systems. We encourage the submission of papers that disprove or strengthen existing assumptions, deepen the understanding of existing problems, and validate known techniques in environments in which they were never before used or tested, with preference given to experimental results based on production data. Deployed-system papers will be treated similarly to other papers for publication purposes; they need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should offer useful guidance to practitioners.  
 A good deployed-systems paper:  
 clearly articulates lessons learned from deploying in production; 
  describes an operational system of broad interest; 
  discusses practical problems encountered in production; and 
  supports the lessons with appropriate evidence, potentially including statistical data from the actual deployment, empirical evaluation of the system (on production platforms rather than small testbeds), and anecdotes. 
  For deployed systems papers, the title should be prefixed with "Deployed System: "  , followed by the title. The prefix will not be published in the proceedings. Authors must also indicate that they are submitting a deployed-systems paper by checking the appropriate checkbox on the submission form. If a paper is both short and falls in the deployed systems category, both prefixes should be used (in any order), and both checkboxes selected.  
 Double-blind Policy for Deployed-system Paper:  All submissions for FAST '25 are required to follow the double-blind policy (see above). However, with deployed-system papers, the product or company described in the paper need not be anonymized (unlike author names).  
 Author Response Period  
 FAST '25 will allow authors to respond to reviews prior to final decision, according to the schedule above. Authors must limit their response to correcting factual errors in the reviews, to addressing questions posed by reviewers and to clarifying the ideas in the paper. Responses may include new experiments and data in response to a reviewer's request. Responses are optional and limited to 1000 words. FAST will be enforcing a hard limit on the length of the author's response for fairness and to reduce workload (for both authors and reviewers): exceeding the word limit will impact a paper negatively.  
 Conflict Identification  
 Upon submitting your paper, authors must indicate conflicts with PC members. A conflict exists in one of the following cases:  
 Institution:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution. A completed internship does not constitute an institutional conflict.  
 Advisor/Advisee:  Doctoral thesis advisor and post-doctoral advisor (if relevant) are conflicts for life.  
 Collaboration:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years.  
 Close friends and family:  Close family relations (e.g., spouse, parent/child, sibling) and close friends are conflicts forever if they are potential reviewers.  
 The PC will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. If there is no basis for conflicts indicated by authors, such conflicts will be removed. Do not identify PC members as a conflict solely to avoid having them as reviewers. If you have any questions about conflicts, contact the program co-chairs.  
 Author Notification and Beyond  
 Authors will be notified of paper acceptance or rejection according to the schedule above. If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, contact conference@usenix.org  as soon as possible. Visa applications are reportedly taking more than two months to process. Please identify yourself as a presenter or an author, and include your mailing address in your email request.  
 Early Rejection Notification.  This year, we will notify authors of papers that are rejected early in the process, prior to the author response period. The goal is to allow authors of early rejected papers to use reviewer feedback earlier and resubmit to another conference as soon as possible. Early rejected papers will no longer be considered under submission (regarding multiple submission policies) upon receipt of a rejection notification.  
 All papers will be available online to registered attendees no earlier than Friday, January 31, 2025. If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify production@usenix.org  . The papers will be available online to everyone beginning on the first day of the main conference, Tuesday, February 25, 2025. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX FAST '25 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  .

 FASE 2025  
 28th International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering  
   
 General Information  
 FASE is concerned with the foundations on which software engineering is built.  
   
 Submissions should make novel contributions to making software engineering a more mature and soundly-based discipline. Contributions should be supported by appropriate arguments and validation. Contributions that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. We welcome contributions to all such fundamental approaches, including:  
 applications of AI to software engineering, including search-based, learning-based approaches, and advances in code generation and program synthesis, automated testing and debugging, software documentation and program understanding intelligent code review and refactoring, DevOps and AIOps, and applications of large language models (LLMs). 
  software engineering foundations for AI-based systems, for example with focus on: explainability, transparency and trust, data management, testing and verification, lifecycle management, system architecture; 
  software quality and testing: validation and verification of functional and non-functional software properties ( including security and data privacy) using techniques such as theorem proving, model checking, testing, analysis simulation, refinement methods, metrics or visualization techniques; 
  software engineering as an engineering discipline, including its interaction with and impact on society and economics; 
  ethical and responsible software engineering: prioritizing fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI and software systems while addressing societal concerns like inequality and bias; 
  requirements engineering: capture, consistency, and change management of software requirements, natural language processing for requirement elicitation; 
  software architectures: description and analysis of the architecture, e.g., SOA, microservice architectures cloud-native architectures, event-driven architectures, model-driven architectures, or software product lines; 
  specification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems: (self-)adaptive, autonomous collaborative, intelligent, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, cyber-physical, data-centric, service-oriented applications, multi-agent systems, safety-critical, real-time, blockchain-based, mixed-reality systems human-in-the-loop systems or digital twins; 
  model-driven engineering: model transformation, meta-modelling, design and semantics of domain-specific languages consistency and synchronization of models, generative architectures, low-code and no-code development; 
  software processes: support for iterative, agile, and open source development; 
  software evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering, configuration management and architectural change, mining software repositories. 

 Important Dates and Submissions  
 The important dates are available in the Joint Call for Papers  .  
   
 Selected papers from the FASE proceedings will be invited to submit an extended version to the Elsevier journal Science of Computer Programming (SCP)  . All publications in the special issue will be open access.  
 Detailed information on artifact evaluation  can be found here  .  

 Submission Categories  
   
 FASE 2025 solicits four types of submissions: research papers, empirical evaluation papers, new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers, tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers. Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface  .  
 Research papers  clearly identify and justify a principled advance to the fundamentals of software engineering. Research papers should clearly articulate their contribution, and provide sufficient evidence for the soundness and applicability of the proposed approach. Research papers are expected to be 15–18 pp (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 Empirical evaluation papers  evaluate existing software challenges or critically validate current proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, simulations, etc. Scientific reflection on problems and practices in the software industry also falls into this category. We also encourage authors to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper, but should at least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs, and clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. Empirical evaluation papers are expected to be 15–18 pp (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) papers  seek to disrupt the status quo with forward-looking, thought-provoking innovative research on the foundations of software engineering, as well as lessons learned from the past. Our aim is to accelerate the exposure of the ETAPS community to early yet potentially ground-breaking research results, and to techniques and perspectives that challenge the status quo. To broadly capture this goal, the NIER track at FASE 2025 will publish the following types of papers:  
 Innovative or groundbreaking new ideas at early stages of research, supported by promising initial results and intuitions; 
  Visions of new directions: synergies with other fields or foundational approaches to problems that currently lack foundations in software engineering; 
  Lessons from the past: thoughtful observations on past or current research directions that may be somehow misguided or that let us see current research directions from a new perspective. 
  NIER papers are expected to be 6–8 pp (excluding bibliography). NIER papers will be assessed primarily on their level of originality, relevance, and potential for impact on the field in terms of promoting innovative thinking. Hence inadequacies in the state-of-the-art and the pertinence, correctness, and impact of the idea/vision/lesson must be described clearly. A full evaluation is not required for FASE NIER papers, but preliminary evaluation results may help the reviewers understand the scope of the work better.  
 Tool demonstration papers  and data showcase papers  present a new tool, a new tool component, novel extensions to an existing tool, or a new dataset. They should provide a short description of the theoretical foundations and emphasize the design and implementation concerns, including software architecture. Tool papers should give a clear account of the tool’s functionality and discuss the tool’s practical capabilities with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available, preferably on the web. Experimental evaluation is not required for tools, however, a motivation as to why the tool is interesting and significant should be provided. Dataset papers should describe the curation of datasets essential for software engineering research, replication studies, reporting of negative results, and insights gleaned from mining software repositories. Papers in this category are expected to be 6–8 pp (excluding bibliography). They should have an appendix of up to 6 additional pages with details on the actual demonstration.

 ABOUT ETAPS  
 ETAPS is a primary forum for academic and industrial researchers working on topics relating to software science. ETAPS, established in 1998, is a confederation of four annual conferences accompanied by satellite workshops. ETAPS 2025 is the twenty-eighth event in the series.  
 Why choose ETAPS?  
 ETAPS is one of the world’s leading fora for research on software science, with a history of more than 25 years. 
  The proceedings of ETAPS appear in gold open access, with no article processing charge for the authors specifically. 
  All constituent conferences provide artifact evaluation. 
  In addition to the conference, ETAPS also unites the software science community with activities such as a blog on software science, a PhD workshop, sessions on diversity and inclusion and an ask-me-anything session. 
  Poster and Tool demo sessions are organized over the week. 
  Spin Symposium and Rust Verification Workshop are colocated with ETAPS again.

The proceedings volumes will appear in gold open access, so the published versions of all papers will be available for everyone to download from the publisher’s website freely from the date of online publication, perpetually. The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors.  
 AWARDS  
 The strongest papers from the four conferences will be marked as distinguished papers and highlighted in the conference program. From these distinguished papers, the EAPLS, EASST, and EATCS, and the Best Tool Paper Award committees will select the best ETAPS papers.  
 The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  
 The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  
 The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.  
 All distinguished papers will be highlighted in the program.  
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States.
