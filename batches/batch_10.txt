 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest  
   This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.

 Welcome to CHI 2025!   
  
 The ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction.  
 CHI takes place in Yokohama, Japan, at the PACIFICO Yokohama  from 26 April to 1 May 2025, while also supporting remote attendance.  
 The conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. Today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead.  
 The cherry blossom or ‘Sakura’ as depicted in the CHI’25 logo signifies a time of renewal and optimism. The conference takes place in the period of cherry blossom growth and in this environment of optimism and renewal, we wish you will find your IkiCHI.

 Papers  
 You must submit the abstract/metadata by the 5th Sept AoE in order to submit the full paper by the 12th Sept AoE.   
   
 Please submit papers through the Precision Conference Submission Portal    
   
 CHI 2025 papers will follow the same revise & resubmit process from CHI 2024. Authors can read more about the rationale behind CHI 2024’s updates in this post by the CHI 2024 Papers Chairs  .  
   
 Important Facts   
 Revise and Resubmit: | CHI 2025 Papers will continue with a revise and resubmit phase for papers above a certain threshold, where authors have the opportunity to respond to reviewer feedback and improve their paper as part of our | review cycle | . 
  Paper Length: | Concise and succinct writing are strongly encouraged. | There are two paper length categories. The paper length should be counted excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. 
  Short Papers: | Submissions of 5,000 words or less. 
  Standard-Length Papers: | Submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words (about 7,000-8,000 words on average). 
  Submissions with Excessive Length: Submissions of more than 12,000 words will be desk rejected if their length is not justified. | In a very exceptional case, such submissions may be considered for full review, but authors must provide clear strong justification for why submissions are required to be more than 12,000 words. 
  A paper must be stand alone. | All important information to understand the contributions of their work must be in the main paper excluding appendices, videos, and supplemental materials. Reviewers/ACs expect the relevant details to be in the main text of the paper itself. Any extra materials helpful for understanding the work but not necessary (e.g., interview script, coding, additional results, etc.) may be added as an appendix at the end of the main paper, but note that reviewers/ACs are | NOT | required to read the appendices and supplementary materials for review. 
  Accessibility: | Paper submissions are expected to follow the | SIGCHI Guide to an Accessible Submission | . 
  Inclusivity: | Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible. 
  Mandatory Video Presentation: | All accepted authors are required to upload a video presentation by the video presentation deadline, | Thursday, March 13, 2025 | . Note that this deadline for submitting a video presentation is earlier than in 2024. 
  No Video Previews: | Unlike previous years, CHI 2025 has decided NOT to collect video previews (30-second videos to show the core idea of your work), and authors do not need to prepare them. 
    
 Important Dates   
 All times are in Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone. When the deadline is day D  , the last time to submit is when D  ends AoE. Check your local time in AoE.

 ACM Selection Process Category   
 Refereed   
   
 Introduction   
 CHI Papers present excellent original research from all areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). CHI Papers are read and cited worldwide and have a broad impact on the development of HCI theory, method, and practice.  
 Authors must  present accepted papers at the CHI Conference either in person or virtually. Accepted manuscripts appear in the Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  , which appears in the ACM Digital Library  . The ACM supports Gold and Green open access options  , and the papers by corresponding authors from ACM Open  institutions will be published as Gold Open Access.  
 Accepted papers may come from any area of HCI activity: academia or industry; science, engineering, or craft; analysis or design. Acceptance is highly competitive: accepted papers will excel in originality, significance, validity, research quality, and presentation clarity. We are looking forward to seeing your best work!  
   
 ACM’s Publication Policies   
 It is critical that authors review ACM’s publications policies. Please read this separate page  for them.  
   
 Metadata Integrity   
 The abstract/metadata deadline is a hard deadline for listing all author names  ; there are no exceptions  . Changes to the order of authors are allowed only during the Publication-Ready submission phase. The abstract/metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process and author representation  . If any of the authors needs to be added or removed after the abstract/metadata deadline, authors would need to withdraw their submissions/papers.   
 Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the revision period.  
   
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models   
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text  . Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post  describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject  papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
   
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regards to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
   
 Preparing and Submitting Your Paper   
 Step 1. Write Your Paper   
 Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. If you make multiple submissions to CHI 2025 Papers, they must be distinct from each other. Please refer to the | Guide to a Successful Paper Submission | . 
  Please ensure that you use the correct | template | ; a single-column format must be used for the reviewing phase. | Use of different templates or formats may result in desk rejection. 
  Your submission must be anonymized; please ensure that your submission conforms to the | Anonymization Policy | . | Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. 
  Concise and succinct writing are strongly encouraged in any submission. | Short submissions with a length of 5,000 words or less are strongly welcomed. These papers will go through exactly the same review process although reviewers will be encouraged to ensure that evaluation expectations are commensurate with length and contribution size. 
  Authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution. The average length of CHI papers is approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words (two standard deviations above the average) will be desk rejected, except in circumstances where the authors are able to provide a strong justification. Authors may contact the relevant subcommittee chairs for guidance on appropriate justification. Submissions that are clearly not complete research papers (e.g., abstracts, work-in-progress, entire theses, extensive journal articles) will be desk rejected. | Papers, where the length is incommensurate with contributions, will be desk rejected. 
  Your paper must be stand alone. | You may use appendices and/or supplementary materials to share additional information about your work, but all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF. Heavy reliance on appendices and/or supplementary materials can be a ground for rejection including desk rejection. 
  If you have any concurrent submissions to CHI or other venues that are closely related – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field. | Failure to do so will result in desk rejection. | The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on work currently under review at other venues. Please see | ACM guide on prior and simultaneous submissions | . 
  Research Quality: Papers must include enough detail that the research can be reviewed for research quality, given the norms and expectations of the relevant subcommittee (e.g., design papers will be judged as rigorous according to the expectations of the design community, not by the expectations of the computational interaction community). Papers that do not include enough detail to adequately assess research quality may be rejected; | papers that are clearly not situated in relevant research literature may be desk rejected. 
  Reproducibility: Where relevant, authors are strongly encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible. Please refer to the requirements for supplementary materials below. 
  Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. Authors are expected to follow | SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission | . If you have any questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs at | accessibility@chi2025.acm.org | early | in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will have to be reassigned. Note that subcommittees strive to match the best reviewer to each paper – | the best reviewers for the work may not be able to review an inaccessible submission. 
  Inclusivity: Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible; where this is not possible, it should be acknowledged. For example, authors should use gender-inclusive language when developing their papers (see e.g., | HCI Guidelines for Gender Equity and Inclusivity | ) and consider what communities their work is – and is not – supporting, as well as their geographical context. 
  Questions regarding the submission templates can be addressed by the Publications Chairs at | publications@chi2025.acm.org | . All additional questions regarding the paper submissions process should be directed to the Papers Chairs at | papers@chi2025.acm.org | . 
  Step 2. Prepare Supplementary Materials (Optional)   
 All video figures and supplementary material must be anonymized. Non-anonymized supplemental materials will result in desk rejection of the entire submission. 
  Video figures (optional) do not have a specified time limit for the duration, although we recommend staying within 5 minutes. Details are available in the | Guide to Submitting a Video | . 
  Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help reviewers assess your work as well as allow other researchers to replicate your work. Any non-video supplementary material should be submitted as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. 
  Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main submission file. That is, the paper submission must stand on its own without the supplementary material. 
  Step 3. Select a Subcommittee   
 CHI 2025 expects to receive over 4,000 submissions, as it did in 2024. In order to provide high-quality reviews by experts for all submissions, the CHI program committee is divided into topical subcommittees  . When you submit a paper, you can state a preference of up to two subcommittees whose mandates you believe your topic fits into. It is your responsibility to select the subcommittees that offer the best expertise to assess your research, and that you believe will most fully appreciate your contribution. If you are unsure, you can email the subcommittee chairs for advice. The program committee may re-assign submissions to a different subcommittee if neither of the subcommittees selected by the authors possesses adequate expertise in the submission’s topic.  
 Step 4. Complete Submission   
 Make your submission. Authors may submit and edit their materials via | Precision Conference Submission Portal | until the deadlines. The submission system will open for submissions approximately four weeks before the abstract/metadata submission deadline. 
  Abstract/Metadata Submission Deadline: | Authors must submit their title, abstract (150 words max), list of authors, subcommittee selections, and other metadata before this deadline. Only the contact author can edit the submission files. | No new submissions will be allowed after this deadline. Placeholder metadata (e.g. ‘abstract todo’) are not acceptable and will be desk rejected. 
  Listed authors cannot be changed after the abstract/metadata deadline. | No new authors can be added even during the revise and resubmit period or for the camera-ready version. Making changes to the author list can be used to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper, can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers, and can be used to unethical publication practices. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors | including yourself | , and b) that your PCS account email address is valid. | There are no exceptions. 
  Main Paper Deadline: | Authors must submit the pdf of their paper, and related form data, before this deadline. No extensions will be granted. Any submissions showing ‘incomplete’ after the deadline will be deleted. 
  Video and Supplementary Material Deadline: | As described above, authors can submit optional video figures and any other optional supplementary materials before the deadline. 
  Details on the review process itself are described in the Papers Review Process  .  
   
 Upon Acceptance of Your Paper   
 Contact authors of accepted papers will receive instructions  (link tba) on how to prepare and submit a final version by the Publication-Ready Deadline. If the authors are unable to meet these requirements by the Publication-Ready deadline, the Papers Chairs will be notified and may be required to remove the paper from the program. For any issues relating to the publication phase, please contact publications@chi2025.acm.org  .  
 The publication-ready version has to follow the LaTeX and Word templates from ACM. Should you need technical assistance, please direct your technical query to publications@chi2025.acm.org  .  
 Authors will also be required to assign either copyright or license to the ACM or to pay a fee to ACM for Open Access (details about ACM rights management: http://authors.acm.org  , and about the ACM Author-Izer service: http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-service  ). Responsibility for obtaining permissions to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the CHI conference.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.  
   
 Video Presentations   
 All accepted authors are required to upload a video presentation (a presentation video of your accepted work) by the video presentation deadline of Thursday March 13, 2025.  See technical requirements for video content at CHI  as a guidance for preparing a video presentation. Accepted authors will receive the details of video presentations separately.  
 If authors fail to submit their video presentations by the deadline, their accepted work would be withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library.  
 Unlike previous years, CHI 2025 has decided NOT to collect video previews (30-second videos to show the core idea of your work), and authors do not need to prepare them.  
   
 Your Paper at the Conference   
 Authors of accepted papers are required to present their work at CHI 2025, and the presenting author must register for their paper presentations. Those who cannot attend in-person will have the option to present virtually with a virtual registration rate. Further instructions regarding the presentation of the work will be shared closer to the conference dates. If authors fail to participate in presenting their work, their accepted work would be withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library.  
   
 Your Paper After the Conference   
 Accepted papers will be distributed in the CHI Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide. Video presentations of accepted papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.

  Calls for Hosting CHI PLAY 2027 and Beyond 

 The Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI). We call this area “player-computer interaction”.  
   Apply to Volunteer Today!    

 October 13-16 2025  
 The goal of CHI PLAY is to highlight and foster discussion of current high quality research in games and HCI as foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference features streams that blend academic research papers, masterclasses, interactive play demos, student game design competition, poster session and industry insights.  
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

  Calls for Hosting CHI PLAY 

 Calls for Hosting CHI PLAY  

 We actively solicit hosts for CHI PLAY. At this time the Steering Committee wishes to solicit bids that are focussed on hosting a hybrid conference, i.e. an in-person conference, though with support for online presentation and engagement as is feasible without compromising the in-person experience.  
  The host proposal process is intended to be as lightweight as possible, allowing the SC to conduct an informed review. The bid does not need to be a “polished” document, but should aim to include among others:  
 Details of the potential city, including typical hotel costs 
  Details of at least one possible venue, including an indication of the cost of hiring the venue for 1 day of workshops and 3 days of the single-track conference (assuming 150-250 on site attendees), and the AV facilities required, and WiFi networking capable of handling 600+ connected devices. This need not be final but indicative of the costs of holding the conference in that location. Additionally, we would appreciate some indication of how any online components of the conference could be supported. 
  Expected potential dates 
  Indications of potential collocation with other synergetic events 
  A possible high-level schedule of the conference, which should be based on recent CHI PLAY conferences. Innovative ideas for other sessions or sub-events are very welcome 
  Short bios of the general chairs and any local chairs or other community members, who have indicated their willingness to serve. Program Chairs for the archival papers/notes track should NOT be specified. The SC will work with the general chairs to choose program chairs after the host is chosen. 
  Potential local sponsors, both public bodies and local companies. 
  It is essential that proposals reflect CHI PLAY’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity (this should be reflected in all aspects of the conference from the choice of general chairs through to the day-to-day running of the conference itself). 
  We strive for attending at different continents. 
  Prospective hosts are encouraged to review the ACM SIG Conference Planning Guide  . As an ACM-sponsored conference, the ACM takes on financial liability (e.g., signing contracts for the venue) and will assist the general chairs with negotiations with a suitable venue as necessary.  
 As with previous conferences, it is crucial to keep the registration costs and other costs associated with attending the conference as low as possible, so that attendance is open to as many people as possible. Please look forcost-effective options for catering and other expected costs and listing low-cost accommodation possibilities.  
 Deadline for proposals for hosting CHI PLAY 2026:  October 13, 2024 – but earlier submissions are welcome. If you are thinking of submitting a proposal but possibly for a later year, please get in touch with the chair of the steering committee, Vero Vanden Abeele, sc-chair@chiplay.org, or any other member of the steering committee. The SC is happy to help advise prospective hosts before a final proposal is submitted.

 The ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. CHI takes place in Yokohama, Japan, at the PACIFICO Yokohama from 26 April to 1 May 2025, while also supporting remote attendance. The conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. Today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead. The cherry blossom or ‘Sakura’ as depicted in the CHI’25 logo signifies a time of renewal and optimism. The conference takes place in the period of cherry blossom growth and in this environment of optimism and renewal, we wish you will find your IkiCHI.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-06-13

 The Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI).  
 10 Years of Fun & Play    

 14-17 October 2024  
   
 The goal of CHI PLAY is to highlight and foster discussion of current high quality research in games and HCI as foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference features streams that blend academic research papers, masterclasses, interactive play demos, student game design competition, poster session and industry insights.  
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

 The GAMES track of PACMHCI (CHI PLAY)  welcomes research that furthers an understanding of the player experience, as well as contributions on novel designs or implementations of player-computer interactions, and contributions to the theory of play and games. The GAMES track welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences; however, technical contributions without impact on players or game designers and developers are not within scope.  
  
 SUBMISSIONS  
 The PACMHCI GAMES track is the premier international venue for research in interactive games and play. Papers are published in the ACM Journal PACMHCI, in the GAMES track, and accepted papers are invited to present at the CHI PLAY conference series. We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to interactive play. Submission should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. We invite contributions across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including, but not limited to:  
 Novel input or output technologies for games and play 
  Studies that contribute to our understanding of player experience 
  Innovative game mechanics and playful interactions 
  Theoretical contributions on play and games 
  Accessible and inclusive design 
  Esports, live streaming, and spectator experiences 
  Advances in game user research, game evaluation methods, and methods for conducting games research 
  Psychology of players and typologies of games and players 
  Studies of applied, serious, and persuasive games (e.g., games and play for health, wellbeing, and learning) 
  Gamification and motivational design 
  Virtual and augmented reality in games and play 
  New tools for game creation and co-creation 
  Game analytics and novel visualizations of player experiences 
  Developer experiences and studies of developers 
  Applications of human-centered game AI (e.g., AI for game development or AI to improve player experience) 
  Critical and reflexive approaches to games & play design and experience 
  Industry case studies 
  PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences. Technical contributions without impact on players or other relevant people in the game community, such as moderators, streamers, developers, or designers (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope, nor are systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies), nor are physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components).  
 PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions that are translations of articles published in other languages, so long as the original authors remain, and the paper is clearly identified as a translation with reference to the original paper (in the PCS submission system, not in the anonymized submission draft).  
  
 IMPORTANT FACTS  
 Papers submitted to PACMHCI GAMES will be peer reviewed and provided with one of three decisions: Accept with Minor Revisions, Revise and Resubmit, and Reject. If asked for revisions, authors will have 6 weeks to implement them and submit to a second round of review from the same members of the editorial board and external reviewers. We anticipate that the majority of papers will receive an Accept with Minor Revisions or a Reject decision in the first round, and that only a small number of papers will be carried forward into the Revise and Resubmit process. 
  Papers accepted to PACMHCI GAMES will be invited to present at the CHI PLAY 2024 conference, held in Tampere Finland on Oct 14–17, 2024. 
  IMPORTANT DATES  
 (all times are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth or AoE  )

 April 19, 2024 | Notifications given   
  (accept with minor revisions/revise and resubmit/reject) 
 June 3, 2024 | Revisions due

 SUBMISSION PROCESS DETAILS  
 PACMHCI GAMES uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions  . Selection “SIGCHI” as the Society and “CHI PLAY” as the Conference/Journal to make a new submission.  
 Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the ACM Policy on Authorship  including, but not limited to: That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. Related to this policy, listed authors cannot be changed after the paper submission deadline. No new authors can be added during the revise and resubmit phase or for camera-ready publication. Making changes to the author list can be used as a method to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper and can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors including yourself, and b) that your PCS account email address is a valid one.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication (October, 2024), and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in PACMHCI and the ACM Digital Library. Papers may be made available publicly up to two weeks prior to the conference date.  
  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 PACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template found here: https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  , which is available for LaTeX (and Overleaf), and Word.  
 No minimum or maximum page length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words, or about 17-20 pages in the single column ACM Master Article Template, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers that are widely over the typical length (e.g., above 12,000 words) will be examined carefully to ensure that the size of the contribution warrants the length of the paper.  Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.   
  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials, will be desk rejected.  Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, and the Acknowledgement section. Also, check the meta information in papers prepared using Word.  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”  
 PACMHCI GAMES does not have a policy against uploading preprints to preprint servers, such as SSRN or arXiv, before they are submitted for review at the conference.  
  
 REVISION CYCLES AND DECISIONS  
 PACMHCI GAMES will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle:  
 Accept with Minor Revisions:  Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the revisions deadline for verification by the corresponding associate chair.  
 Revise and Resubmit:  Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Authors should submit their revised manuscript at the revision deadline, along with a summary explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same Associate Chair and reviewers for re-review. We anticipate that a smaller number of submissions will be accepted into this category, as compared to Accept with Minor Revisions, and that not all papers that were invited to provide a revised version will be accepted, and invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Reject:  Submissions that receive this decision have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions within the 6-week revision period. Rejected papers are not able to submit a revision to the 2024 edition of PACMHCI GAMES, and will not be invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Desk Reject:  Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of the GAMES track of PACMHCI. The Track Chairs and Editorial Board may Desk Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Papers may be desk rejected for the following reasons:  
 Incomplete, non-anonymized, or concurrent submissions | Incomplete submissions or working drafts of submissions. 
  Non-anonymized submissions. | Leaving the author names in the paper or having a description or an acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g. places where user studies were conducted and specific supporting grant information). 
  Submissions that fail to declare concurrent submissions that are closely related to the submission. | If you have a concurrent submission under review, you must include an anonymized version of that submission as supplementary material. The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on a project described in a paper that is unpublished or currently under review at other venues. 
  Submissions that are flagged for plagiarism. | Make sure you cite your prior publications by following our Anonymization Policy.

 CONTRIBUTION TYPE FOR REVIEW HANDLING  
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary and secondary contribution type of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:  
 Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, qualitative user studies. 
  Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., quantitative user studies, statistical methods, data modelling. 
  Empirical-Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research. 
  Artefact-Technical, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, visualizations, architectures, implementing novel features in existing systems. 
  Artefact-Design, e.g., research through design, envisionments, guidelines, methods, techniques. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning interactive play studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays. 
  Meta-Research, e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE  
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. For example, interview guides, additional illustrations of their designs, or videos that further describe their systems, and to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors should further consider using open access repositories and make their data and other material available when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to upload data, analysis scripts, and method artefacts as supplementary material to be accessed by reviewers during the review process; these materials will not be made public. Please note that all supplementary materials must be anonymized for the review process.  
  
 ACM POLICY ON USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN SUBMISSIONS  
 All authors should be aware of the ACM Policy on Authorship  , which articulates the authorised use of generative AI in submitted works. In particular, it notes that the use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) is permitted, but all authors are responsible for the content created by these tools, the use of the tools must be disclosed (e.g., in the acknowledgements), and the tool cannot be listed as an author of the submission. As such, authors are responsible for plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication or falsification of content and/or references generated through the use of generative AI tools, and could be sanctioned with penalties, such as a publication ban.  
  
 ACM PUBLICATIONS POLICY ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS  
 All authors of full papers conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research, as detailed in the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects,  including:  
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies. 
  To ensure that authors are in compliance with these policies, authors of papers involving human participants will be asked to confirm having read the policy and provide a mandatory description of how participants were selected, what consent processes were followed (i.e., did they consent and if so what they were told), how they were treated, how data sharing was communicated, and any additional ethical considerations.  
  
 VIDEO FIGURES  
 Video figures are mandatory for submissions that draw from custom-built games or systems that are not freely available (e.g., novel systems, interaction techniques, game designs, mechanics, or envisionments). Figures should showcase the game or system comprehensively (i.e., demonstrate core game mechanics or offer a playthrough) so that reviewers can explore all relevant aspects. Please note that this applies to submissions that contribute systems (i.e., artefacts) and those that study systems (i.e., empirical work). Generally, authors of all papers should consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission if appropriate. Videos should be no more than three minutes long.  
  
 PRESENTING AT THE CHI PLAY CONFERENCE  
 Accepted papers will be invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY conference in Fall 2024. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. All presenting authors will also be required to submit an 8-minute video presentation of their paper.

 Citing Games with Ludographies in CHI PLAY Papers  
 Citing games, whether commercial or academic, has become common in the CHI PLAY community as they represent important scholarly resources for our work. Games are cited to support statements, exemplify abstract ideas, and acknowledge practice; they may also be a form of primary data, on which the research is built. While authors have taken a number of approaches to this, including adding URLs to game websites in brackets, using footnotes, or adding games to their list of references, these have not quite fit; in content, volume, and style. Phoebe O. Toups Dugas started the practice of a “Ludography” in some of her papers several years ago, drawing from the practice of the Game Studies  journal  . We would like to encourage authors to adopt the idea of a Ludography, a special list of game references that comes after the normal list of references in your paper. Submissions are not required to have a Ludography; however, if games are going to be referenced in your paper we would encourage you to help standardize through a Ludography. Regardless of whether or not a ludography is used, it is important to note details of which version of a game was used (often its platform and release date).  
 For the format of referencing games, we will follow the recommendations put forward in the “Citing Games” section of “Author Guidelines” for CHI PLAY 2020 ( https://chiplay.acm.org/2020/guidelines/  ), which has been reproduced below and augmented with additional guidelines.  
 Below we detail the recommended format for citing games and provide a link for Latex support for easily creating Ludographies.  
 Please note:  This is not a requirement for CHI PLAY 2024 for submission or the final version of your papers; only a recommendation. Future CHI PLAY committees may consider adding this as a requirement. For this year, authors may also decide to submit their paper with another format and upon acceptance decide to submit their final version using these guidelines.  
  
 LudograPhies and Citing Games  
 Authors are encouraged to create a game reference list labeled as “Ludography,” wherever appropriate. The Ludography should appear after the typical “References” list at the end of a paper and follow the same general rules as a typical reference list. In-text citations should follow the same format as the typical paper citations but use the “G#” format. For example:  
 … a similar effect to draw the player’s attention can be seen when Mario flashes after getting a star power-up in Super Mario Bros [G1].   
 Word users can follow the guidelines; LaTeX users should use the BibTeX information below. An example of the game reference format follows:  
 Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems. 1994. Super Metroid. Game [SNES]. (18 April 1994). Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.   
 General Pattern (note that for each entry, you should cite a specific version (e.g., platform) for a game): <developer>. <release year>. <game title in italics>. Game [<platform>]. (<game release date in <day> <month> <year> formats>). <publisher name>, <publisher address> (optional) Last played <last played date>.  
 LaTeX / BibTeX users should use the @misc entry type; the data fields should be filled as follows (the running example is at the end):  
 Author: Use the developer or developers of the version being cited. To avoid having the system treat the developer(s) as a first and last name, use curly braces around each developer.  
 Year:  The release year for the version being cited.  
 Title:  The game title, which has to be manually italicized (using \emph).  
 How published:  The word “Game” followed by the platform in square brackets.  
 Day:  The release day, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Month:  The release month, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Note:  The publisher’s name and location, followed optionally by “Last played” and the date last played.  
 Publisher and Address:  The template will not read these (hence the need to enter them as a note).  
 Example:  
 @misc{SM,  
 Address = {Kyoto, Japan},  
 Author = {{Nintendo R\&D1} and {Intelligent Systems}},  
 Day = {18},  
 Howpublished = {Game [SNES]},  
 Month = {April},  
 Note = {Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.},  
 Publisher = {Nintendo},  
 Title = {\emph{Super Metroid}},  
 Year = {1994}  
 }  
 Latex Support for Creating Ludographies  
 To support the practice of creating Ludographies, Josh Aaron Miller and Kutub Gandhi have thoughtfully created a GitHub repository and instructions for creating a Ludography following these guidelines. See Josh’s repository for instructions on how to use it:  
 LaTeX Ludography Package   
 This approach relies on a Latex package called multibib  , which allows creating multiple bibliographies in the same document. As of writing, TAPS (The ACM Publishing System) has not added multibib to their list of “ Accepted Latex Packages  ,” but they have assured us that it is an accepted package and practice.  
 If you have any questions about citing games with ludographies in your CHI PLAY papers, Please feel free to email the paper chairs (papers@chiplay.acm.org).

 Full Papers  
  
 The GAMES track of PACMHCI (CHI PLAY)  welcomes research that furthers an understanding of the player experience, as well as contributions on novel designs or implementations of player-computer interactions, and contributions to the theory of play and games. The GAMES track welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences; however, technical contributions without impact on players or game designers and developers are not within scope.  
  
 SUBMISSIONS  
 The PACMHCI GAMES track is the premier international venue for research in interactive games and play. Papers are published in the ACM Journal PACMHCI, in the GAMES track, and accepted papers are invited to present at the CHI PLAY conference series. We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to interactive play. Submission should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. We invite contributions across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including, but not limited to:  
 Novel input or output technologies for games and play 
  Studies that contribute to our understanding of player experience 
  Innovative game mechanics and playful interactions 
  Theoretical contributions on play and games 
  Accessible and inclusive design 
  Esports, live streaming, and spectator experiences 
  Advances in game user research, game evaluation methods, and methods for conducting games research 
  Psychology of players and typologies of games and players 
  Studies of applied, serious, and persuasive games (e.g., games and play for health, wellbeing, and learning) 
  Gamification and motivational design 
  Virtual and augmented reality in games and play 
  New tools for game creation and co-creation 
  Game analytics and novel visualizations of player experiences 
  Developer experiences and studies of developers 
  Applications of human-centered game AI (e.g., AI for game development or AI to improve player experience) 
  Critical and reflexive approaches to games & play design and experience 
  Industry case studies 
  PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences. Technical contributions without impact on players or other relevant people in the game community, such as moderators, streamers, developers, or designers (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope, nor are systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies), nor are physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components).  
 PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions that are translations of articles published in other languages, so long as the original authors remain, and the paper is clearly identified as a translation with reference to the original paper (in the PCS submission system, not in the anonymized submission draft).  
  
 IMPORTANT FACTS  
 Papers submitted to PACMHCI GAMES will be peer reviewed and provided with one of three decisions: Accept with Minor Revisions, Revise and Resubmit, and Reject. If asked for revisions, authors will have 6 weeks to implement them and submit to a second round of review from the same members of the editorial board and external reviewers. We anticipate that the majority of papers will receive an Accept with Minor Revisions or a Reject decision in the first round, and that only a small number of papers will be carried forward into the Revise and Resubmit process. 
  Papers accepted to PACMHCI GAMES will be invited to present at the CHI PLAY 2024 conference, held in Tampere Finland on Oct 14–17, 2024. 
  IMPORTANT DATES  
 (all times are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth or AoE  )  
  
 February 21, 2024 | Submission deadline 
 April 19, 2024 | Notifications given   
  (accept with minor revisions/revise and resubmit/reject) 
 June 3, 2024 | Revisions due 
 July 5, 2024 | Final notifications given 
 July 24, 2024 | Camera ready deadline

 SUBMISSION PROCESS DETAILS  
 PACMHCI GAMES uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions  . Selection “SIGCHI” as the Society and “CHI PLAY” as the Conference/Journal to make a new submission.  
 Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the ACM Policy on Authorship  including, but not limited to: That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. Related to this policy, listed authors cannot be changed after the paper submission deadline. No new authors can be added during the revise and resubmit phase or for camera-ready publication. Making changes to the author list can be used as a method to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper and can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors including yourself, and b) that your PCS account email address is a valid one.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication (October, 2024), and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in PACMHCI and the ACM Digital Library. Papers may be made available publicly up to two weeks prior to the conference date.  
  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 PACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template found here: https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  , which is available for LaTeX (and Overleaf), and Word.  
 No minimum or maximum page length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words, or about 17-20 pages in the single column ACM Master Article Template, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers that are widely over the typical length (e.g., above 12,000 words) will be examined carefully to ensure that the size of the contribution warrants the length of the paper.  Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.   
  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials, will be desk rejected.  Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, and the Acknowledgement section. Also, check the meta information in papers prepared using Word.  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”  
 PACMHCI GAMES does not have a policy against uploading preprints to preprint servers, such as SSRN or arXiv, before they are submitted for review at the conference.  
  
 REVISION CYCLES AND DECISIONS  
 PACMHCI GAMES will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle:  
 Accept with Minor Revisions:  Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the revisions deadline for verification by the corresponding associate chair.  
 Revise and Resubmit:  Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Authors should submit their revised manuscript at the revision deadline, along with a summary explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same Associate Chair and reviewers for re-review. We anticipate that a smaller number of submissions will be accepted into this category, as compared to Accept with Minor Revisions, and that not all papers that were invited to provide a revised version will be accepted, and invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Reject:  Submissions that receive this decision have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions within the 6-week revision period. Rejected papers are not able to submit a revision to the 2024 edition of PACMHCI GAMES, and will not be invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Desk Reject:  Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of the GAMES track of PACMHCI. The Track Chairs and Editorial Board may Desk Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Papers may be desk rejected for the following reasons:  
 Incomplete, non-anonymized, or concurrent submissions | Incomplete submissions or working drafts of submissions. 
  Non-anonymized submissions. | Leaving the author names in the paper or having a description or an acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g. places where user studies were conducted and specific supporting grant information). 
  Submissions that fail to declare concurrent submissions that are closely related to the submission. | If you have a concurrent submission under review, you must include an anonymized version of that submission as supplementary material. The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on a project described in a paper that is unpublished or currently under review at other venues. 
  Submissions that are flagged for plagiarism. | Make sure you cite your prior publications by following our Anonymization Policy. 
  Submissions that use the wrong format. | All submissions must use the template specified in the Call for Papers. 
  Submissions that are not written in English. 
  Submissions that are very sloppy, e.g., lots of typos, missing references, formatting issues. 
  Submissions in which something is so broken in the paper that makes it impossible to review. 
  Submissions that are clearly out of scope of PACMHCI GAMES. | Technical contributions without impact on people (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope. 
  Systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies) are not within scope. 
  Physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components) are not within scope. 
  A viewpoint or opinion piece that does not fit the contribution types 
  Submissions without sufficient substance or quality to make it through the peer review process | Submissions that are obviously not an academic paper (e.g., patent disclosure, popular press article, a book). 
  Submissions that fail to clearly communicate their contribution, e.g., claim a specific research goal but do not contribute toward it through the presented research. 
  Submissions in which the contribution is much too small given the length of the submitted paper or is considered as a work in progress. 
  Submissions that demonstrate fundamental methodological flaws or do not follow best practices for the applied methods. | Submissions in which the presented analyses are insufficient to validate the stated claims. 
  Submissions too poorly written to be assigned to external reviewers, (e.g., stated contributions are not situated within extant literature or discussed, details are insufficient for reviewers to interpret the methods or findings). 
  Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified before the review process concludes.  
  
 CONTRIBUTION TYPE FOR REVIEW HANDLING  
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary and secondary contribution type of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:  
 Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, qualitative user studies. 
  Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., quantitative user studies, statistical methods, data modelling. 
  Empirical-Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research. 
  Artefact-Technical, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, visualizations, architectures, implementing novel features in existing systems. 
  Artefact-Design, e.g., research through design, envisionments, guidelines, methods, techniques. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning interactive play studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays. 
  Meta-Research, e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE  
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. For example, interview guides, additional illustrations of their designs, or videos that further describe their systems, and to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors should further consider using open access repositories and make their data and other material available when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to upload data, analysis scripts, and method artefacts as supplementary material to be accessed by reviewers during the review process; these materials will not be made public. Please note that all supplementary materials must be anonymized for the review process.  
  
 ACM POLICY ON USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN SUBMISSIONS  
 All authors should be aware of the ACM Policy on Authorship  , which articulates the authorised use of generative AI in submitted works. In particular, it notes that the use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) is permitted, but all authors are responsible for the content created by these tools, the use of the tools must be disclosed (e.g., in the acknowledgements), and the tool cannot be listed as an author of the submission. As such, authors are responsible for plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication or falsification of content and/or references generated through the use of generative AI tools, and could be sanctioned with penalties, such as a publication ban.  
  
 ACM PUBLICATIONS POLICY ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS  
 All authors of full papers conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research, as detailed in the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects,  including:  
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies. 
  To ensure that authors are in compliance with these policies, authors of papers involving human participants will be asked to confirm having read the policy and provide a mandatory description of how participants were selected, what consent processes were followed (i.e., did they consent and if so what they were told), how they were treated, how data sharing was communicated, and any additional ethical considerations.

 Citing games, whether commercial or academic, has become common in the CHI PLAY community as they represent important scholarly resources for our work. Games are cited to support statements, exemplify abstract ideas, and acknowledge practice; they may also be a form of primary data, on which the research is built. While authors have taken a number of approaches to this, including adding URLs to game websites in brackets, using footnotes, or adding games to their list of references, these have not quite fit; in content, volume, and style. Phoebe O. Toups Dugas started the practice of a “Ludography” in some of her papers several years ago, drawing from the practice of the Game Studies  journal  . We would like to encourage authors to adopt the idea of a Ludography, a special list of game references that comes after the normal list of references in your paper. Submissions are not required to have a Ludography; however, if games are going to be referenced in your paper we would encourage you to help standardize through a Ludography. Regardless of whether or not a ludography is used, it is important to note details of which version of a game was used (often its platform and release date).  
 For the format of referencing games, we will follow the recommendations put forward in the “Citing Games” section of “Author Guidelines” for CHI PLAY 2020 ( https://chiplay.acm.org/2020/guidelines/  ), which has been reproduced below and augmented with additional guidelines.  
 Below we detail the recommended format for citing games and provide a link for Latex support for easily creating Ludographies.  
 Please note:  This is not a requirement for CHI PLAY 2024 for submission or the final version of your papers; only a recommendation. Future CHI PLAY committees may consider adding this as a requirement. For this year, authors may also decide to submit their paper with another format and upon acceptance decide to submit their final version using these guidelines.  
  
 LudograPhies and Citing Games  
 Authors are encouraged to create a game reference list labeled as “Ludography,” wherever appropriate. The Ludography should appear after the typical “References” list at the end of a paper and follow the same general rules as a typical reference list. In-text citations should follow the same format as the typical paper citations but use the “G#” format. For example:  
 … a similar effect to draw the player’s attention can be seen when Mario flashes after getting a star power-up in Super Mario Bros [G1].   
 Word users can follow the guidelines; LaTeX users should use the BibTeX information below. An example of the game reference format follows:  
 Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems. 1994. Super Metroid. Game [SNES]. (18 April 1994). Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.   
 General Pattern (note that for each entry, you should cite a specific version (e.g., platform) for a game): <developer>. <release year>. <game title in italics>. Game [<platform>]. (<game release date in <day> <month> <year> formats>). <publisher name>, <publisher address> (optional) Last played <last played date>.  
 LaTeX / BibTeX users should use the @misc entry type; the data fields should be filled as follows (the running example is at the end):  
 Author: Use the developer or developers of the version being cited. To avoid having the system treat the developer(s) as a first and last name, use curly braces around each developer.  
 Year:  The release year for the version being cited.  
 Title:  The game title, which has to be manually italicized (using \emph).  
 How published:  The word “Game” followed by the platform in square brackets.  
 Day:  The release day, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Month:  The release month, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Note:  The publisher’s name and location, followed optionally by “Last played” and the date last played.  
 Publisher and Address:  The template will not read these (hence the need to enter them as a note).  
 Example:  
 @misc{SM,  
 Address = {Kyoto, Japan},  
 Author = {{Nintendo R\&D1} and {Intelligent Systems}},  
 Day = {18},  
 Howpublished = {Game [SNES]},  
 Month = {April},  
 Note = {Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.},  
 Publisher = {Nintendo},  
 Title = {\emph{Super Metroid}},  
 Year = {1994}  
 }  
 Latex Support for Creating Ludographies  
 To support the practice of creating Ludographies, Josh Aaron Miller and Kutub Gandhi have thoughtfully created a GitHub repository and instructions for creating a Ludography following these guidelines. See Josh’s repository for instructions on how to use it:  
 LaTeX Ludography Package   
 This approach relies on a Latex package called multibib  , which allows creating multiple bibliographies in the same document. As of writing, TAPS (The ACM Publishing System) has not added multibib to their list of “ Accepted Latex Packages  ,” but they have assured us that it is an accepted package and practice.  
 If you have any questions about citing games with ludographies in your CHI PLAY papers, Please feel free to email the paper chairs (papers@chiplay.acm.org).

 The GAMES track of PACMHCI (CHI PLAY)  welcomes research that furthers an understanding of the player experience, as well as contributions on novel designs or implementations of player-computer interactions, and contributions to the theory of play and games. The GAMES track welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences; however, technical contributions without impact on players or game designers and developers are not within scope.  
  
 SUBMISSIONS  
 The PACMHCI GAMES track is the premier international venue for research in interactive games and play. Papers are published in the ACM Journal PACMHCI, in the GAMES track, and accepted papers are invited to present at the CHI PLAY conference series. We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to interactive play. Submission should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. We invite contributions across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including, but not limited to:  
 Novel input or output technologies for games and play 
  Studies that contribute to our understanding of player experience 
  Innovative game mechanics and playful interactions 
  Theoretical contributions on play and games 
  Accessible and inclusive design 
  Esports, live streaming, and spectator experiences 
  Advances in game user research, game evaluation methods, and methods for conducting games research 
  Psychology of players and typologies of games and players 
  Studies of applied, serious, and persuasive games (e.g., games and play for health, wellbeing, and learning) 
  Gamification and motivational design 
  Virtual and augmented reality in games and play 
  New tools for game creation and co-creation 
  Game analytics and novel visualizations of player experiences 
  Developer experiences and studies of developers 
  Applications of human-centered game AI (e.g., AI for game development or AI to improve player experience) 
  Critical and reflexive approaches to games & play design and experience 
  Industry case studies 
  PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences. Technical contributions without impact on players or other relevant people in the game community, such as moderators, streamers, developers, or designers (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope, nor are systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies), nor are physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components).  
 PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions that are translations of articles published in other languages, so long as the original authors remain, and the paper is clearly identified as a translation with reference to the original paper (in the PCS submission system, not in the anonymized submission draft).  
  
 IMPORTANT FACTS  
 Papers submitted to PACMHCI GAMES will be peer reviewed and provided with one of three decisions: Accept with Minor Revisions, Revise and Resubmit, and Reject. If asked for revisions, authors will have 6 weeks to implement them and submit to a second round of review from the same members of the editorial board and external reviewers. We anticipate that the majority of papers will receive an Accept with Minor Revisions or a Reject decision in the first round, and that only a small number of papers will be carried forward into the Revise and Resubmit process. 
  Papers accepted to PACMHCI GAMES will be invited to present at the CHI PLAY 2024 conference, held in Tampere Finland on Oct 14–17, 2024. 
  IMPORTANT DATES  
 (all times are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth or AoE  )  
  
 February 21, 2024 | Submission deadline 
 April 19, 2024 | Notifications given   
  (accept with minor revisions/revise and resubmit/reject) 
 June 3, 2024 | Revisions due 
 July 5, 2024 | Final notifications given 
 July 24, 2024 | Camera ready deadline 
 August 14, 2024 | Video submission deadline 

 SUBMISSION PROCESS DETAILS  
 PACMHCI GAMES uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions  . Selection “SIGCHI” as the Society and “CHI PLAY” as the Conference/Journal to make a new submission.  
 Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the ACM Policy on Authorship  including, but not limited to: That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. Related to this policy, listed authors cannot be changed after the paper submission deadline. No new authors can be added during the revise and resubmit phase or for camera-ready publication. Making changes to the author list can be used as a method to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper and can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors including yourself, and b) that your PCS account email address is a valid one.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication (October, 2024), and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in PACMHCI and the ACM Digital Library. Papers may be made available publicly up to two weeks prior to the conference date.  
  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 PACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template found here: https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  , which is available for LaTeX (and Overleaf), and Word.  
 No minimum or maximum page length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words, or about 17-20 pages in the single column ACM Master Article Template, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers that are widely over the typical length (e.g., above 12,000 words) will be examined carefully to ensure that the size of the contribution warrants the length of the paper.  Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.   
  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials, will be desk rejected.  Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, and the Acknowledgement section. Also, check the meta information in papers prepared using Word.  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”  
 PACMHCI GAMES does not have a policy against uploading preprints to preprint servers, such as SSRN or arXiv, before they are submitted for review at the conference.  
  
 REVISION CYCLES AND DECISIONS  
 PACMHCI GAMES will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle:  
 Accept with Minor Revisions:  Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the revisions deadline for verification by the corresponding associate chair.  
 Revise and Resubmit:  Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Authors should submit their revised manuscript at the revision deadline, along with a summary explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same Associate Chair and reviewers for re-review. We anticipate that a smaller number of submissions will be accepted into this category, as compared to Accept with Minor Revisions, and that not all papers that were invited to provide a revised version will be accepted, and invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Reject:  Submissions that receive this decision have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions within the 6-week revision period. Rejected papers are not able to submit a revision to the 2024 edition of PACMHCI GAMES, and will not be invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Desk Reject:  Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of the GAMES track of PACMHCI. The Track Chairs and Editorial Board may Desk Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Papers may be desk rejected for the following reasons:  
 Incomplete, non-anonymized, or concurrent submissions | Incomplete submissions or working drafts of submissions. 
  Non-anonymized submissions. | Leaving the author names in the paper or having a description or an acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g. places where user studies were conducted and specific supporting grant information). 
  Submissions that fail to declare concurrent submissions that are closely related to the submission. | If you have a concurrent submission under review, you must include an anonymized version of that submission as supplementary material. The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on a project described in a paper that is unpublished or currently under review at other venues. 
  Submissions that are flagged for plagiarism. | Make sure you cite your prior publications by following our Anonymization Policy. 
  Submissions that use the wrong format. | All submissions must use the template specified in the Call for Papers. 
  Submissions that are not written in English. 
  Submissions that are very sloppy, e.g., lots of typos, missing references, formatting issues. 
  Submissions in which something is so broken in the paper that makes it impossible to review. 
  Submissions that are clearly out of scope of PACMHCI GAMES. | Technical contributions without impact on people (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope. 
  Systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies) are not within scope. 
  Physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components) are not within scope. 
  A viewpoint or opinion piece that does not fit the contribution types 
  Submissions without sufficient substance or quality to make it through the peer review process | Submissions that are obviously not an academic paper (e.g., patent disclosure, popular press article, a book). 
  Submissions that fail to clearly communicate their contribution, e.g., claim a specific research goal but do not contribute toward it through the presented research. 
  Submissions in which the contribution is much too small given the length of the submitted paper or is considered as a work in progress. 
  Submissions that demonstrate fundamental methodological flaws or do not follow best practices for the applied methods. | Submissions in which the presented analyses are insufficient to validate the stated claims. 
  Submissions too poorly written to be assigned to external reviewers, (e.g., stated contributions are not situated within extant literature or discussed, details are insufficient for reviewers to interpret the methods or findings). 
  Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified before the review process concludes.  
  
 CONTRIBUTION TYPE FOR REVIEW HANDLING  
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary and secondary contribution type of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:  
 Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, qualitative user studies. 
  Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., quantitative user studies, statistical methods, data modelling. 
  Empirical-Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research. 
  Artefact-Technical, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, visualizations, architectures, implementing novel features in existing systems. 
  Artefact-Design, e.g., research through design, envisionments, guidelines, methods, techniques. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning interactive play studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays. 
  Meta-Research, e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE  
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. For example, interview guides, additional illustrations of their designs, or videos that further describe their systems, and to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors should further consider using open access repositories and make their data and other material available when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to upload data, analysis scripts, and method artefacts as supplementary material to be accessed by reviewers during the review process; these materials will not be made public. Please note that all supplementary materials must be anonymized for the review process.  
  
 ACM POLICY ON USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN SUBMISSIONS  
 All authors should be aware of the ACM Policy on Authorship  , which articulates the authorised use of generative AI in submitted works. In particular, it notes that the use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) is permitted, but all authors are responsible for the content created by these tools, the use of the tools must be disclosed (e.g., in the acknowledgements), and the tool cannot be listed as an author of the submission. As such, authors are responsible for plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication or falsification of content and/or references generated through the use of generative AI tools, and could be sanctioned with penalties, such as a publication ban.  
  
 ACM PUBLICATIONS POLICY ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS  
 All authors of full papers conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research, as detailed in the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects,  including:  
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies. 
  To ensure that authors are in compliance with these policies, authors of papers involving human participants will be asked to confirm having read the policy and provide a mandatory description of how participants were selected, what consent processes were followed (i.e., did they consent and if so what they were told), how they were treated, how data sharing was communicated, and any additional ethical considerations.  
  
 VIDEO FIGURES  
 Video figures are mandatory for submissions that draw from custom-built games or systems that are not freely available (e.g., novel systems, interaction techniques, game designs, mechanics, or envisionments). Figures should showcase the game or system comprehensively (i.e., demonstrate core game mechanics or offer a playthrough) so that reviewers can explore all relevant aspects. Please note that this applies to submissions that contribute systems (i.e., artefacts) and those that study systems (i.e., empirical work). Generally, authors of all papers should consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission if appropriate. Videos should be no more than three minutes long.  
  
 PRESENTING AT THE CHI PLAY CONFERENCE  
 Accepted papers will be invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY conference in Fall 2024. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. All presenting authors will also be required to submit an 8-minute video presentation of their paper.

 Citing Games with Ludographies in CHI PLAY Papers  
 Citing games, whether commercial or academic, has become common in the CHI PLAY community as they represent important scholarly resources for our work. Games are cited to support statements, exemplify abstract ideas, and acknowledge practice; they may also be a form of primary data, on which the research is built. While authors have taken a number of approaches to this, including adding URLs to game websites in brackets, using footnotes, or adding games to their list of references, these have not quite fit; in content, volume, and style. Phoebe O. Toups Dugas started the practice of a “Ludography” in some of her papers several years ago, drawing from the practice of the Game Studies  journal  . We would like to encourage authors to adopt the idea of a Ludography, a special list of game references that comes after the normal list of references in your paper. Submissions are not required to have a Ludography; however, if games are going to be referenced in your paper we would encourage you to help standardize through a Ludography. Regardless of whether or not a ludography is used, it is important to note details of which version of a game was used (often its platform and release date).  
 For the format of referencing games, we will follow the recommendations put forward in the “Citing Games” section of “Author Guidelines” for CHI PLAY 2020 ( https://chiplay.acm.org/2020/guidelines/  ), which has been reproduced below and augmented with additional guidelines.  
 Below we detail the recommended format for citing games and provide a link for Latex support for easily creating Ludographies.  
 Please note:  This is not a requirement for CHI PLAY 2024 for submission or the final version of your papers; only a recommendation. Future CHI PLAY committees may consider adding this as a requirement. For this year, authors may also decide to submit their paper with another format and upon acceptance decide to submit their final version using these guidelines.  
  
 LudograPhies and Citing Games  
 Authors are encouraged to create a game reference list labeled as “Ludography,” wherever appropriate. The Ludography should appear after the typical “References” list at the end of a paper and follow the same general rules as a typical reference list. In-text citations should follow the same format as the typical paper citations but use the “G#” format. For example:  
 … a similar effect to draw the player’s attention can be seen when Mario flashes after getting a star power-up in Super Mario Bros [G1].   
 Word users can follow the guidelines; LaTeX users should use the BibTeX information below. An example of the game reference format follows:  
 Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems. 1994. Super Metroid. Game [SNES]. (18 April 1994). Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.   
 General Pattern (note that for each entry, you should cite a specific version (e.g., platform) for a game): <developer>. <release year>. <game title in italics>. Game [<platform>]. (<game release date in <day> <month> <year> formats>). <publisher name>, <publisher address> (optional) Last played <last played date>.  
 LaTeX / BibTeX users should use the @misc entry type; the data fields should be filled as follows (the running example is at the end):  
 Author: Use the developer or developers of the version being cited. To avoid having the system treat the developer(s) as a first and last name, use curly braces around each developer.  
 Year:  The release year for the version being cited.  
 Title:  The game title, which has to be manually italicized (using \emph).  
 How published:  The word “Game” followed by the platform in square brackets.  
 Day:  The release day, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Month:  The release month, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Note:  The publisher’s name and location, followed optionally by “Last played” and the date last played.  
 Publisher and Address:  The template will not read these (hence the need to enter them as a note).  
 Example:  
 @misc{SM,  
 Address = {Kyoto, Japan},  
 Author = {{Nintendo R\&D1} and {Intelligent Systems}},  
 Day = {18},  
 Howpublished = {Game [SNES]},  
 Month = {April},  
 Note = {Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.},  
 Publisher = {Nintendo},  
 Title = {\emph{Super Metroid}},  
 Year = {1994}  
 }  
 Latex Support for Creating Ludographies  
 To support the practice of creating Ludographies, Josh Aaron Miller and Kutub Gandhi have thoughtfully created a GitHub repository and instructions for creating a Ludography following these guidelines. See Josh’s repository for instructions on how to use it:  
 LaTeX Ludography Package   
 This approach relies on a Latex package called multibib  , which allows creating multiple bibliographies in the same document. As of writing, TAPS (The ACM Publishing System) has not added multibib to their list of “ Accepted Latex Packages  ,” but they have assured us that it is an accepted package and practice.  
 If you have any questions about citing games with ludographies in your CHI PLAY papers, Please feel free to email the paper chairs (papers@chiplay.acm.org).

 The GAMES track of PACMHCI (CHI PLAY)  welcomes research that furthers an understanding of the player experience, as well as contributions on novel designs or implementations of player-computer interactions, and contributions to the theory of play and games. The GAMES track welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences; however, technical contributions without impact on players or game designers and developers are not within scope.  
  
 SUBMISSIONS  
 The PACMHCI GAMES track is the premier international venue for research in interactive games and play. Papers are published in the ACM Journal PACMHCI, in the GAMES track, and accepted papers are invited to present at the CHI PLAY conference series. We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to interactive play. Submission should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. We invite contributions across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including, but not limited to:  
 Novel input or output technologies for games and play 
  Studies that contribute to our understanding of player experience 
  Innovative game mechanics and playful interactions 
  Theoretical contributions on play and games 
  Accessible and inclusive design 
  Esports, live streaming, and spectator experiences 
  Advances in game user research, game evaluation methods, and methods for conducting games research 
  Psychology of players and typologies of games and players 
  Studies of applied, serious, and persuasive games (e.g., games and play for health, wellbeing, and learning) 
  Gamification and motivational design 
  Virtual and augmented reality in games and play 
  New tools for game creation and co-creation 
  Game analytics and novel visualizations of player experiences 
  Developer experiences and studies of developers 
  Applications of human-centered game AI (e.g., AI for game development or AI to improve player experience) 
  Critical and reflexive approaches to games & play design and experience 
  Industry case studies 
  PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences. Technical contributions without impact on players or other relevant people in the game community, such as moderators, streamers, developers, or designers (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope, nor are systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies), nor are physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components).  
 PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions that are translations of articles published in other languages, so long as the original authors remain, and the paper is clearly identified as a translation with reference to the original paper (in the PCS submission system, not in the anonymized submission draft).  
  
 IMPORTANT FACTS  
 Papers submitted to PACMHCI GAMES will be peer reviewed and provided with one of three decisions: Accept with Minor Revisions, Revise and Resubmit, and Reject. If asked for revisions, authors will have 6 weeks to implement them and submit to a second round of review from the same members of the editorial board and external reviewers. We anticipate that the majority of papers will receive an Accept with Minor Revisions or a Reject decision in the first round, and that only a small number of papers will be carried forward into the Revise and Resubmit process. 
  Papers accepted to PACMHCI GAMES will be invited to present at the CHI PLAY 2024 conference, held in Tampere Finland on Oct 14–17, 2024. 
  IMPORTANT DATES  
 (all times are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth or AoE  )  
  
 February 21, 2024 | Submission deadline 
 April 19, 2024 | Notifications given   
  (accept with minor revisions/revise and resubmit/reject) 
 June 3, 2024 | Revisions due 
 July 5, 2024 | Final notifications given 
 July 24, 2024 | Camera ready deadline 
 August 14, 2024 | Video submission deadline 

 SUBMISSION PROCESS DETAILS  
 PACMHCI GAMES uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions  . Selection “SIGCHI” as the Society and “CHI PLAY” as the Conference/Journal to make a new submission.  
 Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the ACM Policy on Authorship  including, but not limited to: That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. Related to this policy, listed authors cannot be changed after the paper submission deadline. No new authors can be added during the revise and resubmit phase or for camera-ready publication. Making changes to the author list can be used as a method to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper and can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors including yourself, and b) that your PCS account email address is a valid one.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication (October, 2024), and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in PACMHCI and the ACM Digital Library. Papers may be made available publicly up to two weeks prior to the conference date.  
  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 PACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template found here: https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  , which is available for LaTeX (and Overleaf), and Word.  
 No minimum or maximum page length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words, or about 17-20 pages in the single column ACM Master Article Template, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers that are widely over the typical length (e.g., above 12,000 words) will be examined carefully to ensure that the size of the contribution warrants the length of the paper.  Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.   
  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials, will be desk rejected.  Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, and the Acknowledgement section. Also, check the meta information in papers prepared using Word.  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”  
 PACMHCI GAMES does not have a policy against uploading preprints to preprint servers, such as SSRN or arXiv, before they are submitted for review at the conference.  
  
 REVISION CYCLES AND DECISIONS  
 PACMHCI GAMES will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle:  
 Accept with Minor Revisions:  Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the revisions deadline for verification by the corresponding associate chair.  
 Revise and Resubmit:  Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Authors should submit their revised manuscript at the revision deadline, along with a summary explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same Associate Chair and reviewers for re-review. We anticipate that a smaller number of submissions will be accepted into this category, as compared to Accept with Minor Revisions, and that not all papers that were invited to provide a revised version will be accepted, and invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Reject:  Submissions that receive this decision have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions within the 6-week revision period. Rejected papers are not able to submit a revision to the 2024 edition of PACMHCI GAMES, and will not be invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Desk Reject:  Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of the GAMES track of PACMHCI. The Track Chairs and Editorial Board may Desk Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Papers may be desk rejected for the following reasons:  
 Incomplete, non-anonymized, or concurrent submissions | Incomplete submissions or working drafts of submissions. 
  Non-anonymized submissions. | Leaving the author names in the paper or having a description or an acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g. places where user studies were conducted and specific supporting grant information). 
  Submissions that fail to declare concurrent submissions that are closely related to the submission. | If you have a concurrent submission under review, you must include an anonymized version of that submission as supplementary material. The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on a project described in a paper that is unpublished or currently under review at other venues. 
  Submissions that are flagged for plagiarism. | Make sure you cite your prior publications by following our Anonymization Policy. 
  Submissions that use the wrong format. | All submissions must use the template specified in the Call for Papers. 
  Submissions that are not written in English. 
  Submissions that are very sloppy, e.g., lots of typos, missing references, formatting issues. 
  Submissions in which something is so broken in the paper that makes it impossible to review. 
  Submissions that are clearly out of scope of PACMHCI GAMES. | Technical contributions without impact on people (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope. 
  Systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies) are not within scope. 
  Physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components) are not within scope. 
  A viewpoint or opinion piece that does not fit the contribution types 
  Submissions without sufficient substance or quality to make it through the peer review process | Submissions that are obviously not an academic paper (e.g., patent disclosure, popular press article, a book). 
  Submissions that fail to clearly communicate their contribution, e.g., claim a specific research goal but do not contribute toward it through the presented research. 
  Submissions in which the contribution is much too small given the length of the submitted paper or is considered as a work in progress. 
  Submissions that demonstrate fundamental methodological flaws or do not follow best practices for the applied methods. | Submissions in which the presented analyses are insufficient to validate the stated claims. 
  Submissions too poorly written to be assigned to external reviewers, (e.g., stated contributions are not situated within extant literature or discussed, details are insufficient for reviewers to interpret the methods or findings). 
  Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified before the review process concludes.  
  
 CONTRIBUTION TYPE FOR REVIEW HANDLING  
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary and secondary contribution type of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:  
 Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, qualitative user studies. 
  Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., quantitative user studies, statistical methods, data modelling. 
  Empirical-Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research. 
  Artefact-Technical, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, visualizations, architectures, implementing novel features in existing systems. 
  Artefact-Design, e.g., research through design, envisionments, guidelines, methods, techniques. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning interactive play studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays. 
  Meta-Research, e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE  
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. For example, interview guides, additional illustrations of their designs, or videos that further describe their systems, and to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors should further consider using open access repositories and make their data and other material available when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to upload data, analysis scripts, and method artefacts as supplementary material to be accessed by reviewers during the review process; these materials will not be made public. Please note that all supplementary materials must be anonymized for the review process.  
  
 ACM POLICY ON USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN SUBMISSIONS  
 All authors should be aware of the ACM Policy on Authorship  , which articulates the authorised use of generative AI in submitted works. In particular, it notes that the use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) is permitted, but all authors are responsible for the content created by these tools, the use of the tools must be disclosed (e.g., in the acknowledgements), and the tool cannot be listed as an author of the submission. As such, authors are responsible for plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication or falsification of content and/or references generated through the use of generative AI tools, and could be sanctioned with penalties, such as a publication ban.  
  
 ACM PUBLICATIONS POLICY ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS  
 All authors of full papers conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research, as detailed in the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects,  including:  
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies. 
  To ensure that authors are in compliance with these policies, authors of papers involving human participants will be asked to confirm having read the policy and provide a mandatory description of how participants were selected, what consent processes were followed (i.e., did they consent and if so what they were told), how they were treated, how data sharing was communicated, and any additional ethical considerations.  
  
 VIDEO FIGURES  
 Video figures are mandatory for submissions that draw from custom-built games or systems that are not freely available (e.g., novel systems, interaction techniques, game designs, mechanics, or envisionments). Figures should showcase the game or system comprehensively (i.e., demonstrate core game mechanics or offer a playthrough) so that reviewers can explore all relevant aspects. Please note that this applies to submissions that contribute systems (i.e., artefacts) and those that study systems (i.e., empirical work). Generally, authors of all papers should consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission if appropriate. Videos should be no more than three minutes long.  
  
 PRESENTING AT THE CHI PLAY CONFERENCE  
 Accepted papers will be invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY conference in Fall 2024. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. All presenting authors will also be required to submit an 8-minute video presentation of their paper.  
  
 OVERLEAF FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS  
 Go to the “Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) – Official Primary Article Templates” in | Overleaf 
  As PACM HCI Games Track is a journal, click on the | ACM Journals Primary Article Template | . 
  Delete the following files: | sample-lualatex.tex 
  sample-sigconf.tex 
  sample-xelatex.tex 
  sample-franklin.png 
  Acmart.pdf 
  Go to the file sample-authordraft.tex | You can rename this file to be clear to you that this is the main file that you will edit. 
  Please use the “review” and “anonymous” styles: \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} | The review option adds line numbers to your paper 
  The anonymous option replaces the authors section for “ANONYMOUS AUTHOR(S)”. In case of anonymous submission, please remember that your submission must be anonymized whether you use this style or not. 
  There are other files that you may delete or replace later: | sample-base.bib: this is a sample bibliography. You can create your own bib file and use it for your references. 
  sample-franklin.png: this is a sample png image. You will delete and replace it later with your proper figures. 
  Now you are ready to begin. You can rename your files if you want. 
   
 Citing Games with Ludographies in CHI PLAY Papers  
 Citing games, whether commercial or academic, has become common in the CHI PLAY community as they represent important scholarly resources for our work. Games are cited to support statements, exemplify abstract ideas, and acknowledge practice; they may also be a form of primary data, on which the research is built. While authors have taken a number of approaches to this, including adding URLs to game websites in brackets, using footnotes, or adding games to their list of references, these have not quite fit; in content, volume, and style. Phoebe O. Toups Dugas started the practice of a “Ludography” in some of her papers several years ago, drawing from the practice of the Game Studies  journal  . We would like to encourage authors to adopt the idea of a Ludography, a special list of game references that comes after the normal list of references in your paper. Submissions are not required to have a Ludography; however, if games are going to be referenced in your paper we would encourage you to help standardize through a Ludography. Regardless of whether or not a ludography is used, it is important to note details of which version of a game was used (often its platform and release date).  
 For the format of referencing games, we will follow the recommendations put forward in the “Citing Games” section of “Author Guidelines” for CHI PLAY 2020 ( https://chiplay.acm.org/2020/guidelines/  ), which has been reproduced below and augmented with additional guidelines.  
 Below we detail the recommended format for citing games and provide a link for Latex support for easily creating Ludographies.  
 Please note:  This is not a requirement for CHI PLAY 2024 for submission or the final version of your papers; only a recommendation. Future CHI PLAY committees may consider adding this as a requirement. For this year, authors may also decide to submit their paper with another format and upon acceptance decide to submit their final version using these guidelines.  
  
 LudograPhies and Citing Games  
 Authors are encouraged to create a game reference list labeled as “Ludography,” wherever appropriate. The Ludography should appear after the typical “References” list at the end of a paper and follow the same general rules as a typical reference list. In-text citations should follow the same format as the typical paper citations but use the “G#” format. For example:  
 … a similar effect to draw the player’s attention can be seen when Mario flashes after getting a star power-up in Super Mario Bros [G1].   
 Word users can follow the guidelines; LaTeX users should use the BibTeX information below. An example of the game reference format follows:  
 Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems. 1994. Super Metroid. Game [SNES]. (18 April 1994). Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.   
 General Pattern (note that for each entry, you should cite a specific version (e.g., platform) for a game): <developer>. <release year>. <game title in italics>. Game [<platform>]. (<game release date in <day> <month> <year> formats>). <publisher name>, <publisher address> (optional) Last played <last played date>.  
 LaTeX / BibTeX users should use the @misc entry type; the data fields should be filled as follows (the running example is at the end):  
 Author: Use the developer or developers of the version being cited. To avoid having the system treat the developer(s) as a first and last name, use curly braces around each developer.  
 Year:  The release year for the version being cited.  
 Title:  The game title, which has to be manually italicized (using \emph).  
 How published:  The word “Game” followed by the platform in square brackets.  
 Day:  The release day, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Month:  The release month, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Note:  The publisher’s name and location, followed optionally by “Last played” and the date last played.  
 Publisher and Address:  The template will not read these (hence the need to enter them as a note).  
 Example:  
 @misc{SM,  
 Address = {Kyoto, Japan},  
 Author = {{Nintendo R\&D1} and {Intelligent Systems}},  
 Day = {18},  
 Howpublished = {Game [SNES]},  
 Month = {April},  
 Note = {Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.},  
 Publisher = {Nintendo},  
 Title = {\emph{Super Metroid}},  
 Year = {1994}  
 }  
 Latex Support for Creating Ludographies  
 To support the practice of creating Ludographies, Josh Aaron Miller and Kutub Gandhi have thoughtfully created a GitHub repository and instructions for creating a Ludography following these guidelines. See Josh’s repository for instructions on how to use it:  
 LaTeX Ludography Package   
 This approach relies on a Latex package called multibib  , which allows creating multiple bibliographies in the same document. As of writing, TAPS (The ACM Publishing System) has not added multibib to their list of “ Accepted Latex Packages  ,” but they have assured us that it is an accepted package and practice.

  Learning Analytics for Transition, Disruption and Social Change  

 Society for Learning Analytics Research  
 The Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) is an interdisciplinary network of leading international researchers who are exploring the role and impact of analytics on teaching, learning, training and development.  

 About the University of California  
 The University of California, Irvine is a driving force of innovation and discovery in educational technology and learning analytics. UCI is ranked in the top 10 of public institutions in the United States (currently number 7). Further, as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), hosting LAK with UCI will afford broader access to students and faculty that are currently under-represented within the LAK community. Such opportunities to ensure diversity in the LAK conference will benefit the Society for many years to come.

 LAK22 Moves Online  
 We had sincerely hoped to be able to host a face to face event in 2022 but given the ongoing realities of the global pandemic due to the Delta COVID-19 variant there continues to be substantial uncertainty of international travel restrictions and vaccination rates/status for many countries. While for some countries restrictions have been able to be relaxed, for others restrictions are being reintroduced therefore as a diverse and global community we need to take into account the situations of all members when planning an international event that involves many months of preparation. Thank you to all the participants who responded to the survey and have raised their issues and concerns with us. Thus the Society for Learning Analytics Research and LAK22 organizers have made the difficult decision to host LAK22 fully online.  We would like to acknowledge and thank the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Spa for working with us during these challenging times and we hope to host a face to face LAK there sometime in the future. Please visit the News page to read our full announcement  .  

   Why You Should Join Us at LAK and Beyond!  
 The Society for Learning Analytics Research is celebrating 12 years of LAK conferences in 2022! The field continues to grow year over year. LAK21 was our largest conference of almost 600 attendees from around the world. Take a peek at why we think you should submit to LAK conferences, attend LAK or LASI, join our mailing list and better yet become a SoLAR Member! At SoLAR, our overall mission continues to be to grow the field of learning analytics globally. Join us in this mission today and we hope to see you at an event soon!

  Submission site:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025    
 Topics   
 Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research on algorithms and complexity. Typical areas include:   
 algorithm design and analysis 
  sequential, parallel, and distributed algorithms 
  data structures 
  computational and structural complexity 
  lower bounds and limitations of algorithms 
  randomized and approximation algorithms 
  parameterized algorithms and parameterized complexity classes 
  smoothed analysis of algorithms 
  alternatives to the worst-case analysis of algorithms (e.g., algorithms with predictions)

  algorithmic economics (including auctions and contests) 
  computational learning theory 
  computational biology and bioinformatics 
  algorithmic issues in communication networks 
  algorithms for discrete optimization (including convex optimization) 
  algorithm engineering 
  Paper Submission and Proceedings   
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most 15 pages, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page.   
 The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. LNCS templates are available here: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  . No changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Submissions should be anonymized according to the double-blind review policy . Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered.   
 Submissions will be through EasyChair (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025   )   
 The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion.   
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed.   
 At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered.   
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission.   
 The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv).   
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members.   
 PC Submissions   
 Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed.   
 Proceedings   
 Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As in previous editions, the proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer LNCS.  
 Best Paper Award   
 Two selected papers will receive the Best Paper Award, sponsored by Springer.   
 Contact Information   
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to Loukas Georgiadis at  loukas@uoi.gr

 *Important Dates* -Deadline for submissions: November 15, 2024 (AoE) -Author notification: January 31, 2025 -Camera-ready due: February 14, 2025 -Submission site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025   
 *Topics* Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research on algorithms and complexity. Typical areas include: -algorithm design and analysis -sequential, parallel, and distributed algorithms -data structures -computational and structural complexity -lower bounds and limitations of algorithms -randomized and approximation algorithms -parameterized algorithms and parameterized complexity classes -smoothed analysis of algorithms -alternatives to the worst-case analysis of algorithms (e.g., algorithms with predictions) -on-line computation and competitive analysis -streaming algorithms -quantum algorithms and complexity -algorithms in algebra, geometry, number theory and combinatorics -computational geometry -algorithmic game theory and mechanism design -algorithmic economics (including auctions and contests) -computational learning theory -computational biology and bioinformatics -algorithmic issues in communication networks -algorithms for discrete optimization (including convex optimization) -algorithm engineering  
 *Paper Submission and Proceedings* Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most 15 pages, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page.  
 The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. No changes to font size page geometry, etc. are permitted. Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered. Submissions will be through EasyChair ( https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025  )  
 The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion.  
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered.  
 *Double-Blind Reviewing* CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission.  
 The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv).  
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members.  
 *PC Submissions* Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed.

 Mission Statement and Topics   
 Automata theory is the foundation of computer science. Its applications have spread to almost all areas of computer science and many other disciplines. In addition, there is a growing number of software systems designed to manipulate automata, regular expressions, grammars, and related structures; examples include AGL, AMORE, Automate, FADELA, FinITE, FireLite, FLAP, FSM, Grail, INR, Intex, ASTL, MONA, and Turing's World.  
    
 The purpose of these conferences is to bring together members of the academic, research and industrial community who have an interest in implementation and application of automata to demonstrate and analyze their work and to explain the problems they have been solving.   
  
  We solicit papers and demos on all aspects of implementation and application of automata and related structures, including theoretical aspects, as but not limited to:   

 Complexity of Automata Operations 
  Compilers 
  Computer-aided verification 
  Concurrency 
  Data structure design for automata 
  Data and image compression 
  Design and architecture of automata software 
  Digital libraries 
  DNA/molecular/membrane computing 
  Document engineering 
  Editors, environments 
  Experimental studies and practical experiences 
  Industrial applications 
  Natural language processing 
    
 Networking 
  New algorithms for manipulating automata 
  Object-oriented modeling 
  Pattern-matching 
  Quantum computing 
  Speech and speaker recognition 
  Structured and semi-structured documents 
  Symbolic manipulation environments for automata 
  Teaching 
  Text processing 
  Techniques for graphical display of automata 
  VLSI 
  Viruses, related phenomena

  Paper Submission and Proceedings   
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most 15 pages, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page.   
 The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. LNCS templates are available here: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  . No changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Submissions should be anonymized according to the double-blind review policy . Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered.   
 Submissions will be through EasyChair (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025   )   
 The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion.   
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed.   
 At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered.   
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission.   
 The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv).   
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members.   
 PC Submissions   
 Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed.   
 Proceedings   
 Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As in previous editions, the proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer LNCS.  
 Best Paper Award   
 Two selected papers will receive the Best Paper Award, sponsored by Springer.   
 Contact Information   
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to Loukas Georgiadis at  loukas@uoi.gr

  How are ratings calculated?   To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzes reviews to verify trustworthiness.

This is certainly an ambitious objective, not only because of the very nature of the activities, mostly research and development, but also because of its scope, that encompasses, and in some cases goes beyond, the already broad field of telecommunications.  
   
  Key performance indicators show the trend, existing laboratory facilities set the boundaries, and short descriptions of about 80 projects and research topics, chosen from a much larger set, provide compelling examples of IT activity in line with its mission “to create and disseminate scientific knowledge in the field of telecommunications“.

  Instituto de Telecomunicações (it) has grown fast to become a quite large research institution in Portugal with more than 400 researchers distributed by 8 sites and branches across the country and activities spanning a very broad range of topics in telecommunications and supporting sciences and technologies.  
   
  A major challenge has been to use this diversity as an opportunity for it to become more than the sum of its parts, by enhancing internal cooperation between sites and groups and exploiting existing and potential synergies to the full. To pursue this goal, it issued in June 2008 an internal call for two-year interdisciplinary projects that had to involve at least two different research groups. The call closed on July 14, 2008 and received 36 proposals (4 were considered not eligible). The 32 eligible proposals were evaluated by international experts that rated them as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor. All Excellent and Very Good proposals (15) were funded for a total amount of 600 k€.  
   
  Activities in it internal projects involved 100 researchers from 22 groups and originated 16 prototypes, about 40 journal papers, and 45 PhD and MSc dissertations. In a few projects, the quality and innovation of the results fueled contacts with interested external national and international partners. We are convinced that, in addition to their own scientific and technological merits, these projects provided an important contribution to strengthen internal collaboration and to  
  achieve excellence in telecommunications, which is in the essence of it mission.

  Instituto de Telecomunicações (it) has grown fast to become a quite large research institution in Portugal with more than 600 researchers distributed through 8 sites and branches across the country, with activities spanning a very broad range of topics in telecommunications and supporting sciences and technologies.  
   
  As it is growing, a major challenge has been to use this diversity as an opportunity for it to become more than the sum of its parts, by enhancing internal cooperation between sites and groups exploiting existing and potential synergies to the full. To pursue this goal and profiting from the experience gained in our second call for two year interdisciplinary projects that had to involve at least two different research groups, launched in 2008, it issued in January 2011 a third call for internal projects that closed on the 27th of February 2011 and received 40 proposals. All proposals were evaluated by international experts that rated them as Excellent, Very Good, Good Fair or Poor. All proposals rated as Excellent and Very Good, (21) were funded for a total amount of 721 k€.  
   
  Activities in it internal projects involved 100 researchers from 23 groups and originated 21 prototypes, about 74 journal papers, and 60 PhD and MSc dissertations. In a few projects, the quality and innovation of the results fueled contacts with interested external national and international partners. We are convinced that, in addition to their own scientific and technological merits, these projects provided an important contribution to strengthen internal collaboration and to achieve excellence in telecommunications, which is in the essence of it mission.

  This book aims at describing IT activities, in the period 2008-2012, through a limited number of projects. A simple language, for the nonspecialist reader was adopted throughout. This is certainly an ambitious objective, not only because of the very nature of the activities described, mostly research and development, but also because of its scope that encompasses, and in some cases goes beyond, the already broad field of telecommunications.  
   
  A previous edition dealt with the period 2002-2007. Together they cover IT activity since it became an Associated Laboratory. Key performance indicators show the trends, existing laboratory facilities set the boundaries and short descriptions of about 70 projects and research topics, chosen from a much larger set, provide compelling samples of IT activity in line with its mission “to create and disseminate scientific knowledge in the field of telecommunications “.

  Instituto de Telecomunicações (it) has grown fast to become a quite large research institution in Portugal with more than 600 researchers distributed through 7 sites and branches across the country, with activities spanning a very broad range of topics in telecommunications and supporting sciences and technologies.  
  As it is growing, a major challenge has been to use this diversity as an opportunity for it to become more than the sum of its parts, by enhancing internal cooperation between sites and groups exploiting existing and potential synergies to the full. To pursue this goal and profiting from the experience gained in our previous calls, launched in 2008 and 2010 for two-year interdisciplinary  
  projects that had to involve at least two different research groups, it issued in September 2013 a fourth call for internal projects that closed on the 3rd of November 2013 and received 83 proposals.  
  All proposals were evaluated by international experts that rated them as Excellent, Very Good, Good Fair or Poor. All proposals rated as Excellent and Very Good, (25) were funded for a total amount of 893 k€.  
  These projects, which are described ahead, fill an important gap in the existing FCT funding schemes that tend to favor small, monochromatic research teams. Activities in it’s internal projects involved 170 it researchers from 28 groups and originated 40 prototypes, about 109 journal papers, and 102 PhD and MSc dissertations.  
  In a few projects, the quality and innovation of the results fueled contacts and new projects with interested external national and international partners.

 Submission Details  
 COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references) papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix. Authors should follow the general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings  , which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.  
 To prepare your submission, please make sure to use the COLING 2025 style files available here:  
 LaTeX 
  Word 
  Overleaf 
  Papers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review.   
 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).  
  
 Deadline for direct submissions | September 16, 2024 
 Commitment deadline for ARR papers | October 20, 2024 
 Author rebuttal phase (for direct submissions) | October 30 - November 1, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance for COLING 2025 | November 29, 2024 
 Camera-ready papers due | December 15, 2024 
 Tutorials and Workshops | January 19-20, 2025 
 Main Conference | January 21-24, 2025 
  
 Anonymity Period  
 COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

 COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references) papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix. Authors should follow the general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings  , which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.  
 To prepare your submission, please make sure to use the COLING 2025 style files available here:  
 LaTeX 
  Word 
  Overleaf 
  Papers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review.   
 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).  
  
 Deadline for direct submissions | September 16, 2024

 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

  (NAACL 2025 workshops will take place in Albuquerque, New Mexico May 3–May 4, 2025)  
 List of Topics  
  ------------------  
  Just as coding assistants have dramatically increased productivity for coding tasks over the last two years, researchers in the NLP community have begun to explore methods and opportunities ahead for creating scientific assistants that can help with the process of scientific discovery and increase the pace at which novel discoveries are made. Over the last year, language models have been used to create problem-general scientific discovery assistants that are not restricted to narrow problem domains or formulations. Such applications hold opportunities for assisting researchers in broad domains, or scientific reasoning more generally. Beyond assisting, a growing body of work has begun to focus on the prospect of creating largely autonomous scientific discovery agents that can make novel discoveries with minimal human intervention.  
 These recent developments highlight the possibility of rapidly accelerating the pace of scientific discovery in the near term. Given the influx of researchers into this expanding field, this workshop proposes to serve as a vehicle for bringing together a diverse set of perspectives from this quickly expanding subfield, helping to disseminate the latest results, standardize evaluation, foster collaboration between groups, and allow discussing aspirational goals for 2025 and beyond. As such, the workshop welcomes and covers a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to):  
 ***Literature-based Discovery:*** This topic focuses on using existing scientific articles to facilitate novel discoveries, by finding “undiscovered public knowledge’’, conditioning novel studies based on existing work, or easing the search and reading process. Systems that read the literature at scale may ultimately help us come up with research ideas that are more novel, broader in scope, and operationalized in more useful experiments.  
 ***Agent-centered Approaches:*** Agent models are being used to form end-to-end scientific discovery pipelines, with separate agents taking on different roles, such as hypothesis generation, execution, and reviewing experiments.  
 ***Automated Experiment Execution:*** Agents that can automatically execute experiments require a large number of pragmatic skills that emerging benchmarks are beginning to evaluate, including downloading data, writing code, and interfacing with apps.  
 ***Automated Replication:*** Science is generally suffering a “reproducibility crisis”, and NLP is not immune to this, with (for example) 59% of reproducibility attempts finding worse performance than papers originally reported. Automated reproducibility attempts to read original papers, Github repositories, and instructions, to replicate experiments fully automatically.  
 ***Data-driven Discovery:*** Reading existing papers and combining or re-analyzing existing datasets frequently allows for novel data-driven discoveries without having to collect new data empirically, and may yield inexpensive novel discoveries.  
 ***Discovery in Virtual Environments:*** Virtual environments, including text-based simulations, allow training and evaluating agents at aspects of the scientific discovery process in simulated proxy tasks without running physical experiments, which are costly and time consuming.  
 ***Discovery with Humans in the Loop:*** How can we make the textual knowledge from literature best engage with humans in the discovery process, through various interfaces, processes, and surfaces?  
 ***Assistants for Scientific Writing:*** Language models can be used as assistants in the scientific dissemination process, either as planners for writing text such as academic articles, or blog posts intended for public consumption.  
 Submission Guidelines  
  --------------------------------  
  We welcome three types of papers: archival workshop papers, non-archival papers, and non-archival cross-submissions. Only regular archival workshop papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the OpenReview website set up for this workshop ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ). In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content.  
 ***Archival, regular workshop papers:*** Authors should submit a paper up to 8 pages (both short and long papers are welcome), with unlimited pages for references, following the ACL author guidelines. The reported research should be substantially original. All submissions will be reviewed in a single track, regardless of length. Accepted papers will be presented as posters by default, and best papers may be given the opportunity for a brief talk to introduce their work. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymised. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings. Preference for oral presentation slots in the workshop will be given to archival papers.  
  Non-archival regular workshop papers: This is the same as the option above, but these papers will not appear in the proceedings and will typically only receive poster presentation slots. Non-archival submissions in this category will still undergo the review process. This is appropriate for nearly finished work that is intended for submission to another venue at a later date.  
 ***Non-archival cross-submissions:*** We also solicit cross-submissions, i.e., papers on relevant topics that have already appeared in other venues (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NLP, ML, or cognitive science venues, among others). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the AISD audience. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format, and the submission length is determined by the original venue. The paper selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee in a non-blind fashion. These papers will typically receive poster presentation slots.  
  In addition, we welcome papers on relevant topics that are under review or to be submitted to other venues (including the ACL 2024 main conference). These papers must follow the regular workshop paper format and will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Papers in this category will be reviewed by workshop reviewers.  
 Note to authors: While you submit your paper through OpenReview ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ), please select the “Submission Type” properly based on the guidelines.  
 For questions about the submission guidelines, please contact workshop organizers via aisd-organizers  [at] googlegroups.com

  Welcome from the President | November 2024 How CI Techniques Can Help in Addressing Climate Change Hello Fellow CIS-ers, Hangzhou, where I am now living and which is most well-known for the West Lake, has recently witnessed the highest temperature this summer, 43 degrees Celsius. I studied and worked in this city for 12 years during the 1980s and 1990s, but had no impression of ever experiencing such hot weather during that time. Clearly, climate change is making heat waves hotter and more frequent. Then, what we CIS-ers... | Read more: Welcome...

  What is Computational Intelligence? 

 What is Computational Intelligence?  
  Computational Intelligence (CI) is the theory, design, application and development of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms. Traditionally the three main pillars of CI have been Neural Networks  , Fuzzy Systems  and Evolutionary Computation  . However, in time many nature inspired computing paradigms have evolved. Thus CI is an evolving field and at present in addition to the three main constituents, it encompasses computing paradigms like ambient intelligence, artificial life, cultural learning, artificial endocrine networks, social reasoning, and artificial hormone networks. CI plays a major role in developing successful intelligent systems, including games and cognitive developmental systems. Over the last few years there has been an explosion of research on Deep Learning, in particular deep convolutional neural networks. Nowadays, deep learning has become the core method for artificial intelligence. In fact, some of the most successful AI systems are based on CI.  
 Neural Networks  
 Using the human brain as a source of inspiration, artificial neural networks (NNs) are massively parallel distributed networks that have the ability to learn and generalize from examples. This area of research includes feedforward NNs, recurrent NNs, self-organizing NNs, deep learning, convolutional neural networks and so on.  
 For an introduction to neural networks watch this IEEE.tv video:  
 Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks

 Learning Lip Synchronization from Audio 
  Fuzzy Systems  
 Using the human language as a source of inspiration, fuzzy systems (FS) model linguistic imprecision and solve uncertain problems based on a generalization of traditional logic, which enables us to perform approximate reasoning. This area of research includes fuzzy sets and systems, fuzzy clustering and classification, fuzzy controllers, linguistic summarization, fuzzy neural networks, type 2 fuzzy sets and systems, and so on.

  Fuzzy Systems Application 
  Evolutionary Computation  
 Using the biological evolution as a source of inspiration, evolutionary computation (EC) solves optimization problems by generating, evaluating and modifying a population of possible solutions. EC includes genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, genetic programming, swarm intelligence, differential evolution, evolvable hardware, multi-objective optimization and so on.

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March  
  IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions.  
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

 General Information  
 The Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR was run every two years starting 2003, becoming the premier conference for practical data systems work. From 2020 on, the conference is organized every year, alternating between Amsterdam and the USA. CIDR 2025 will be held in Amsterdam.  
 The CIDR program consists of single-track keynote, paper and demo presentations. There are also evening sessions, including a lively gong show, and plenty of time for interaction among the delegates, who are researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry. CIDR encourages papers about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insight resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. Papers are encouraged to present novel approaches to data systems architecture and usage, to inspire discussions on the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field. Authors are encouraged to submit their best systems work, and are limited to submit at most two papers.  
 Please check the Call for Papers  for more information on important dates and submission guidelines.

  Important Dates  
 (all deadlines are 11:59pm Pacific Time)  August 2nd, 2024:  submission deadline for all contributions  October 4th, 2024:  author notification for all contributions  January 19-22, 2025:  conference    
  Overview  
 The annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference, complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field.  
 We invite contributions on novel approaches to data management systems, architecture, and usage including cloud based systems for data processing as well as related system issues such as data storage, networking, hardware acceleration, custom processors, memory hierarchies processor interconnects, etc. in the context of data processing. We also encourage new approaches to data management and system building based on or in support of ML/AI technologies. CIDR encourages contributions about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insights, resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based insight, and vision.  
 CIDR 2025 invites two kinds of contributions:  
 Papers (at most 6 pages). We invite both regular research papers and more visionary papers that promote interesting ideas and ongoing work. 
  Demos (a video or a description of the demo in at most 6 pages). 
  To encourage authors to submit only their best work, each person can be an author or co-author of at most one  submission of any kind   . Authors who feel their work is best captured through a demo should submit a demo proposal. Demos and papers will be interweaved in a single-tracked program.  
 Papers, and demos will be reviewed by the program committee, who will select the final program in co-operation with the organizing committee.  
 The number of participants at CIDR is limited to allow an intimate single-track experience. In the past, CIDR reached maximum capacity several weeks before the conference. As in the past, registration for the 2025 conference will be carried out in two phases. Authors who co-authored a paper or demo submission are invited to register first. Then, registration is on a first-come-first- serve basis until the conference capacity is reached.  
 Submission  
 Papers should be electronically submitted in PDF format to CMT  .  
 Similarly to previous years, conference submissions must be formatted using the double-column ACM sigconf style   (see the ACM Template  ), and must not exceed 6 pages in length including all references and appendix   . Videos can be submitted in HTML or MPEG format. Submissions will be reviewed by the program committee which will make acceptance and rejection decisions. Final versions of accepted submissions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the CIDR conference and by the VLDB Endowment. The final versions of accepted papers and demos have no page limit and can be significantly expanded from the submitted form. At least one author of an accepted paper or demo will be expected to attend the conference in person to present the paper. For accepted papers and demos with several co-authors, the program committee reserves the right to select the co-author who should present the paper at the conference as a condition of acceptance (this typically means a senior author will be chosen as the presenter).  
 Camera-Ready Guidelines  
 Camera-ready papers need to follow the formatting instructions above. Additionally, they need to include the following copyright notice at the bottom left of the first page:  
 This paper is published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0) license. Authors reserve their rights to disseminate the work on their personal and corporate Web sites with the appropriate attribution, provided that you attribute the original work to the authors and CIDR 2025. 15th Annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR '25).

 Diversity and Inclusion  
 As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) are crucial for the data management community. Please refer to D&I in DB  for the details of the coordinated D&I efforts across our community. Paper writing can make a material difference. So, we would like to strongly plead with the authors to follow the D&I writing instructions  when drafting the paper submissions.

CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based insight, and vision.  
 CIDR 2025 invites two kinds of contributions:  
 Papers (at most 6 pages). We invite both regular research papers and more visionary papers that promote interesting ideas and ongoing work. 
  Demos (a video or a description of the demo in at most 6 pages). 
  To encourage authors to submit only their best work, each person can be an author or co-author of at most one  submission of any kind   . Authors who feel their work is best captured through a demo should submit a demo proposal. Demos and papers will be interweaved in a single-tracked program.  
 Papers, and demos will be reviewed by the program committee, who will select the final program in co-operation with the organizing committee.  
 The number of participants at CIDR is limited to allow an intimate single-track experience. In the past, CIDR reached maximum capacity several weeks before the conference. As in the past, registration for the 2025 conference will be carried out in two phases. Authors who co-authored a paper or demo submission are invited to register first. Then, registration is on a first-come-first- serve basis until the conference capacity is reached.  
 Submission  
 Papers should be electronically submitted in PDF format to CMT  .  
 Similarly to previous years, conference submissions must be formatted using the double-column ACM sigconf style   (see the ACM Template  ), and must not exceed 6 pages in length including all references and appendix   . Videos can be submitted in HTML or MPEG format. Submissions will be reviewed by the program committee which will make acceptance and rejection decisions. Final versions of accepted submissions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the CIDR conference and by the VLDB Endowment. The final versions of accepted papers and demos have no page limit and can be significantly expanded from the submitted form. At least one author of an accepted paper or demo will be expected to attend the conference in person to present the paper. For accepted papers and demos with several co-authors, the program committee reserves the right to select the co-author who should present the paper at the conference as a condition of acceptance (this typically means a senior author will be chosen as the presenter).

  Overview  
 The annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference, complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field.  
 We invite contributions on novel approaches to data management systems, architecture, and usage including cloud based systems for data processing as well as related system issues such as data storage, networking, hardware acceleration, custom processors, memory hierarchies processor interconnects, etc. in the context of data processing. We also encourage new approaches to data management and system building based on or in support of ML/AI technologies. CIDR encourages contributions about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insights, resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements.

 Pushing the limits of real-time ML: Nanosecond inference for Physics Discovery at the Large Hadron Collider    

 Abstract:    
  At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), high-energy proton collisions generate O(10,000) exabytes of raw data annually. To manage this immense data volume while adhering to computational and storage limitations, real-time event filtering systems must process millions of proton-proton collisions per second, utilising a staged system of FPGAs, CPUs and GPUs to perform efficient reconstruction and decision-making. Within a few microseconds, over 98% of the collision data must be discarded both rapidly and accurately. As the LHC transitions to its high luminosity phase (HL-LHC), these systems - situated in radiation-shielded caverns one hundred meters underground - will confront data rates equivalent to 5% of global internet traffic, combined with unprecedented data complexity.  
  To maintain data integrity for meaningful physics analyses, highly optimized machine learning (ML) algorithms are being employed for real-time data processing. This demands the development of novel methods and tools to achieve extreme throughput, ultra-low latency, and low-power inference on specialized hardware.  
  In this presentation, we will discuss how real-time ML techniques are employed to process and filter vast amounts of data, enhancing physics signal acceptance. We will explore state-of-the-art methods for designing and deploying high-speed ML algorithms on FPGAs, ASICs, and GPUs. Lastly, we will examine the applications of real-time inference in particle physics experiments and its critical role in facilitating the discovery of New Physics.   
   
  Bio:    
  Thea Klaeboe Aarrestad is a fellow at the Institute for Particle Physics and Astrophysics at ETH Zürich. She holds a PhD in Particle Physics from the University of Zürich and has worked as a research fellow at CERN in Geneva before moving to ETH. Her research centers on how Machine Learning can be applied to particle physics problems, especially focusing on using real-time Machine Learning (ML) and anomaly detection for discovering new physics phenomena. She has worked on tools for performing low-power, nanosecond ML inference on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), as well as developing new ML-based methods for collecting and analysing proton collision data at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. She holds several publications in the topics of machine learning and particle physics in journals like Nature Machine Intelligence, PRL and JHEP. She also coordinates the Fast Machine Learning for Science Laboratory and the Targeted Systems Group within the Accelerated AI Algorithms for Data-Driven Discovery (A3D3) Institute.

 Date: 14 - 18 July 2025   
 Location: Lisbon, Portugal   
 Deadline: Sunday 26 January 2025   
 CiE (Computability in Europe) is a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in new developments in computability and their underlying significance for the real world.  
 The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics. Computability in Europe 2025 "Crossroads of Computability and Logic: Insights, Inspirations, and Innovations" will feature two Tutorial Speakers, 6 Invited Speakers, 6 Special Sessions and the Women in Computability program.  
   
 The Program Committee cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related to the above for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings of CiE 2025. Papers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag.  
 Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we also invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2025 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.

  CONFERENCE TOPICS  
  The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science andwith other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics.  
 PAPER SUBMISSION  
  THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related tothe above for presentation at the conference.  
 The following paper categories are welcome:  
 Regular papers describing solid new research results. Papers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Regular papers must have a maximum of 12 pages, including references but excluding a possible appendix in which one can include proofs and other additional material. Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome. 
  Informal presentations. Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2024 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals. 
  All submissions must be in PDF, formatted using the Springer LNCS style (available at https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), and submitted via EquinOCS:  
 https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/CiE2024   
 Accepted regular papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag.

 The ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)  , currently sponsored by ACM SIGIR (Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval; since 1993) and ACM SIGWEB (Special Interest Group on Hypertext and the Web; since 2006), is an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conference in the areas of information retrieval, knowledge management and databases. Since 1992, it has successfully brought together leading researchers and developers from the three communities, with the purpose of identifying challenging problems facing the development of advanced knowledge and information systems, and shaping future research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings.  
 It provides an international forum for presentation and discussion of research on information and knowledge management, as well as recent advances on data and knowledge bases. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future directions of research by soliciting and reviewing high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. An important part of the conference is the Workshops program which focuses on timely research challenges and initiatives.  
 Student Travel Endowment: The goal of the CIKM Student Travel Endowment is to help young people become part of the CIKM community by providing funds to support student travel, especially when those students are the authors of accepted papers.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 Topics of Interest   
 We encourage submissions of high-quality research papers on the general areas of artificial intelligence, data science, databases, information retrieval, and knowledge management. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following areas:   
 Data and information acquisition and preprocessing (e.g., data crawling, IoT data, data quality, data privacy, mitigating biases, data wrangling) 
  Integration and aggregation (e.g., semantic processing, data provenance, data linkage, data fusion, knowledge graphs, data warehousing, data lake, privacy and security, modeling, information credibility) 
  Efficient data processing (e.g., serverless, data-intensive computing, database systems, indexing and compression, architectures, distributed data systems, dataspaces, customized hardware) 
  Special data processing (e.g., multilingual text, sequential, stream, time series, spatio-temporal, (knowledge) graph, multimedia, scientific, and social media data) 
  Analytics and machine learning (e.g., OLAP, data mining, machine learning and AI, scalable analysis algorithms, algorithmic biases, event detection, and tracking, understanding, and interpretability) 
  Neural Information and knowledge processing (e.g., graph neural networks, domain adaptation, transfer learning, network architectures, neural ranking, neural recommendation, and neural prediction) 
  Data preparation, Valuation, and Trading 
  Information access and retrieval (e.g., web search, question answering and dialogue systems, retrieval models, query processing, personalization, recommender, and filtering systems) 
  Users and interfaces for information systems (e.g., user behavior analysis, user interface design, perception of biases, personalization, interactive information retrieval, interactive analysis, spoken interfaces) 
  Evaluation, performance studies, and benchmarks (e.g., online and offline evaluation, best practices)

 Paper Submissions   
 Authors are invited to submit original, full-length research papers that are not previously published, accepted to be published, or being considered for publication in any other forum. Full-length papers should satisfy the standard requirements of top-tier international research conferences.   
 Manuscripts should be submitted to CIKM 2024 Easychair site in PDF format, using the 2-column ACM sigconf template, see  https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template   . Full papers cannot exceed 9 pages, including an appendix, plus unlimited references (paper content is limited to 9 pages, that means that if you have an appendix, then it should be included within that page limit. It is also ok if you do not have an appendix and instead 9 pages of content). Rejected full papers will not be considered for publication as short papers. The review of manuscripts will be double-blind, and submissions not properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review.   
 Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless this produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. AI tools may be used to edit and polish authors’ work, such as using LLMs for light editing of their text (e.g., automate grammar checks, word autocorrect, and other editing of author-written text), but text “produced entirely” by generative/AI models is not allowed.   
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the work on-site in Boise, Idaho, USA, as scheduled in the conference program.   
 The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   

 Dual Submission Policy   
 Submitting papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences (or any venue with published proceedings) is not allowed  . However, it is allowed to make an abstract submission by May 13, 2024 ( without uploading the paper PDF  ) for a paper that is still under review as long as the ongoing review process ends by the full paper final deadline of May 20, 2024  . You need to withdraw your submission in case the paper is accepted or still under review by May 20, 2024.  
 Authors are allowed to submit papers that have been presented or are to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Authors may also submit anonymized work already available as a preprint (e.g., in arXiv). In this case, the authors must modify the title and abstract while refraining from citing the manuscript to preserve anonymity.   
 Authorship Policy   
 Before paper submission, authors are advised to review  ACM’s authorship policy   carefully. Please ensure that all authors are identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To help reviewers identify potential conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified by the abstract submission deadline. Consequently, no changes to authorship will be allowed under any circumstance after the abstract submission deadline; neither update will be permitted for camera-ready versions.   
 ACM Conflict of Interest Policy   
 All authors must adhere to the ACM Conflict of Interest policy. For full details, please visit this site: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest   
 Desk Rejection Policy   
 Submissions that fail to adhere to the anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty—such as plagiarism, author misrepresentation, or falsification—may be subject to desk rejection by the chairs.   
 ACM Policy Against Harassment   
 All authors and participants must adhere to the ACM Policy Against Harassment. For full details, please visit this site:   
 https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment

  CONFERENCE TOPICS  
  The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science andwith other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics.  
 PAPER SUBMISSION  
  THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related tothe above for presentation at the conference.  
 The following paper categories are welcome:  
 Regular papers describing solid new research results. Papers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Regular papers must have a maximum of 12 pages, including references but excluding a possible appendix in which one can include proofs and other additional material. Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome. 
  Informal presentations. Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2024 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals. 
  All submissions must be in PDF, formatted using the Springer LNCS style (available at https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), and submitted via EquinOCS:  
 https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/CiE2024   
 Accepted regular papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag.
