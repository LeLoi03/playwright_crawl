 The Conference  
 The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering. It covers the design process, test and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state of the art applications of artificial intelligence. Engineers, scientists and researchers involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster feedback from design to research.  
  Special Days on Emerging Topics  
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues.  
 Special Day "New Trends in AI/ML"  
 This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics:  
 Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation 
  Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models 
  AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans 
  Sustainability in AI/ML Development. 
  During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.  
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.  
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

  Special Day "Emerging Computing Paradigms"  
 -formerly "Unconventional Computing"-   
  Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions.  
 The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.

  Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”  
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

  Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing  
 Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created.  
 We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session.  
 If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.

 The Conference  
 The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering. It covers the design process, test and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state of the art applications of artificial intelligence. Engineers, scientists and researchers involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster feedback from design to research.  
  Special Days on Emerging Topics  
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues.  
 Special Day "New Trends in AI/ML"  
 This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics:  
 Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation 
  Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models 
  AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans 
  Sustainability in AI/ML Development. 
  During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.  
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.  
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

  Special Day "Emerging Computing Paradigms"  
 -formerly "Unconventional Computing"-   
  Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions.  
 The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.

  Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”  
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

  Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing  
 Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created.  
 We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session.  
 If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.

  papers@date-conference.com    
  
  Camera-Ready and Presentation  
 Authors of accepted papers will prepare the camera-ready version of the paper, adhering to the IEEE proceedings format and will be checked through PDFeXpress. A recorded video presentation of the paper is also required, according to guidelines that will be made available. It should be noted that accepted Late Breaking Results papers will be published as submitted and are expected to be camera-ready, i.e., no separate camera-ready submission will be possible.  
 Registration Rule for All Accepted Papers  
 Please note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one full conference registration at the paper author rate (i.e., two paper author registrations are needed for two accepted papers, e.g., from the main author or a co-author of the paper). DATE is a physically held conference, and not a hybrid conference.  Therefore, it is mandatory that at least one author of each accepted paper attends the session where the paper is discussed and presents the work as requested, otherwise the paper will be deleted from the proceedings afterwards (despite full payment at the paper author rate).  
  Focus Sessions  
 Focus Sessions can take the form of (1) Panels, discussing visionary and controversial issues or (2) Hot-Topic Sessions, focusing on the introduction and discussion of new R&D problems, addressing trends in the technical domains that are of interest to the conference participants.  
 Focus Session proposals must consist of an extended summary of up to 1,500 words in a PDF file, describing the topic, the authors/speakers and the format and must be submitted at https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/  by Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE  . The submitter of a Focus Session proposal will be notified of acceptance or rejection of his/her proposal by Tuesday, 19 November 2024 AoE  . In case of acceptance, contributors of accepted Focus Sessions will be asked to submit final texts or statements of panellists, as appropriate, for publication in the proceedings as final, camera-ready manuscripts by Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  . Panel sessions are entitled to one (1) page per panellist in the proceedings; Hot-Topic Sessions are allocated a maximum of six (6) pages paper per speaker or one single paper for the entire session which should not exceed ten (10) pages. As a rule of thumb, no more than four speakers per session should be planned for Hot-Topic Sessions. For the accepted Focus Sessions, it is the responsibility of the Focus Session organiser(s) to ensure that the Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  deadline is met and all the camera-ready manuscripts from their respective Focus Sessions are technically sound and meet the editorial standards of the DATE proceedings. The Focus Session Co-Chairs may decline the publication of the final manuscripts in the DATE proceedings if the above responsibility is not fulfilled. Accepted or invited speakers to the Focus Sessions will be required to register for the conference.  
 Further Instructions for Focus Session Submissions   
 In addition to the above-stated important instructions, e.g. w.r.t. author list and double submissions, please adhere to the following:  
 Session Chair/Co-Chair  : Every special session submission must name a chair and a co-chair; the chair and the co-chair are responsible for the preparation of the session and for the monitoring of the session; they cannot be selected among the moderators/panelists, or speakers/presenters.

 Announcements     

 Welcome to the 16th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC’25!   
 Computational creativity is the art, science, philosophy and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviours that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. As a field of research, this area is thriving, with progress in formalising what it means for software to be creative, along with many exciting and valuable applications of creative software in the sciences, the arts, literature, gaming and elsewhere.  
 The ICCC  conference series organized by the Association for Computational Creativity  since 2010 is the only scientific conference that focuses on computational creativity alone and also covers all aspects of it.  
 ICCC’25  will take place from June 23rd to June 27th, 2025.

 Computational Creativity (CC) is a discipline with its roots in scientific disciplines such as Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Engineering, Design, Psychology and Philosophy that each explores the potential for computers to be creative – either in partnership with humans or as autonomous creators in their own right.  
 ICCC is an annual conference that welcomes papers on different aspects of CC, on systems that exhibit varying degrees of creative autonomy, on systems that act as creative partners for human creators, on frameworks that offer greater clarity or computational felicity for thinking about machine (and human) creativity, on methodologies for building or evaluating CC systems, on approaches to teaching CC in schools and universities or to promoting societal uptake of CC as a field and as a technology, and so on.

 Themes and Topics  
 Original research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including, but not limited to:  
 Applications of Computational Creativity: | applications of creativity in areas such as music, language, narrative, poetry, games, visual arts, graphic design, product design, architecture, entertainment, education, mathematical invention, scientific discovery, or programming. 
  Human-Machine Co-Creativity: | systems, studies, frameworks, or methodologies related to co-creativity between humans and AI, with emphasis on systems in which the machine acts as a creative partner. 
  Computational Creativity Evaluation: | metrics, frameworks, formalisms and methodologies for the evaluation of creativity in computational systems, or for the evaluation of how such systems are perceived in society. 
  Social Models: | computational models of social aspects of creativity, including: social creativity, the diffusion of ideas, collaboration, team dynamics, and creativity in social settings. 
  Computational Paradigms: | computational approaches for modelling cognitive aspects of creativity, such as heuristic search, analogical and meta-level reasoning, cognitive architectures, and re-representation. 
  Interdisciplinary Perspectives: | perspectives on computational creativity which draw from philosophical and/or sociological studies in the context of creative AI systems. 
  Data and Creativity: | data science approaches to computational creativity: Resource development and data gathering/knowledge curation for creative AI. There is a need for datasets and resources that are scalable, extensible and freely available/open-source. 
  Societal Impact: | ethical considerations in the design, deployment or testing of creative AI systems, as well as studies that explore the societal impact of computational creativity and generative AI. 
  Psychological Factors: | computational models of psychological factors that enhance creativity, including emotion, surprise (unexpectedness), reflection, conflict, diversity, motivation, knowledge, intuition, reward structures. Additionally, social or experiential factors related to novelty and originality, such as innovation, improvisation, and virtuosity. 
  Provocations: | raising new issues not on this list that bring the foundations of the discipline into question or throw new light on seemingly settled debates. 
  A note on generative AI models:  while the study of generative AI models is both welcomed and encouraged, such models and their application must be properly situated in the CC literature and evaluated according to acceptable practices in the field. Papers that fail to do this are unlikely to be reviewed favorably.  
  
 Paper Types  
 We welcome the submission of five different types of long papers, each with the intent to approach an equal distribution of accepted papers. During your submission, please indicate the category by which your paper best fits into:  
 Technical papers: | these are papers posing and addressing hypotheses about aspects of creative behaviour in computational systems. The emphasis here is on using solid experimentation, computational models, formal proof, and/or argumentation that clearly demonstrates advancement in the state of the art or current thinking in CC research. Strong evaluation of approaches through comparative, statistical, social, or other means is essential. 
  System or Resource description papers: | these are papers describing the building and deployment of a creative system or resource to produce artefacts of potential cultural value in one or more domains. The emphasis here is on presenting engineering achievement, technical difficulties encountered and overcome, techniques employed, reusable resources built, and general findings about how to get computational systems to produce valuable results. Presentation of results from the system or resource is expected. While full evaluation of the approaches employed is not essential if the technical achievement is very high, some evaluation is expected to show the contribution to CC of this work. 
  Study papers: | these are papers which draw on allied fields such as psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, humanities, the arts, and so on; or which appeal to broader areas of AI and Computer Science in general; or which appeal to studies of the field of CC as a whole. The emphasis here is on presenting enlightening novel perspectives related to the building, assessment, or deployment of systems ranging from autonomously creative systems to creativity support tools. Such perspectives can be presented through a variety of approaches including ethnographic studies, thought experiments, comparisons with studies of human creativity, and surveys. The contribution of the paper to CC should be made clear in every case. 
  Cultural application papers: | these are papers presenting the use of creative software in a cultural setting, for example via art exhibitions/books, concerts/recordings/scores, poetry or story readings/anthologies, cookery nights/books, results for scientific journals or scientific practice, released games/game jam entries, and so on. The emphasis here is on a clear description of the role of the system in the given context, the results of the system in the setting, technical details of inclusion of the system, and evaluative feedback from the experience garnered from public audiences, critics, experts, stakeholders, and other interested parties. 
  Position papers: | these are papers presenting an opinion on some aspect of the culture of CC research, including discussions of future directions, speculative explorations of the impact of state-of-the-art approaches, past triumphs or mistakes, and current issues. The emphasis here is on carefully arguing a position; highlighting or exposing previously hidden or misunderstood issues or ideas; and providing thought leadership for the field, either in a general fashion or in a specific setting. While opinions need not be substantiated through formalization or experimentation, any justification of a point of view will need to draw on a thorough knowledge of the field of CC and of overlapping areas, and provide relevant motivations and arguments. 
  ICCC is a conference that emphasises the empirical and theoretical evaluation of technical systems, results and outcomes, in an ethical and scientific fashion. Evaluation is expected in Technical papers (strong evaluation) and in System or Resource description papers. Although evaluation is not required in other types of papers, the contribution of the paper to CC should be made clear.  
 All submissions will be reviewed in terms of quality, impact, and relevance to the area of Computational Creativity.  
  
 Presentation  
 In order to ensure the highest level of quality, all submissions will be evaluated in terms of their scientific, technical, artistic, and/or cultural contribution, and therefore there will be only one format for submission. The program committee will decide the best format for presenting accepted manuscripts in the conference.  
 To be included in the proceedings, each paper must be presented at the conference by one of the authors. This implies that at least one author will have to register and will have to participate live in the session in which their paper is presented, including the designated question-and-answer period.  
  
 Submission instructions  
 This year the submission process has two stages: initial submission of a title and abstract, and subsequent submission of the full paper a week later.  
 Recommended length for the abstract is 100–200 words. 
  The long paper page limit is 8 pages + up to 2 pages of references. 
  Papers will be reviewed in a double-blind fashion, which necessitates that authors take appropriate steps to remain anonymous. 
  You are responsible for making your papers anonymous to allow for double-blind review. Remove all references to your home institution(s), refer to your past work in the third person, etc. 
  To be considered, papers must be submitted as a PDF document formatted according to ICCC style (which is similar to AAAI and IJCAI formats). You can download the updated ICCC’25 LaTeX template [ | here | ] and Word template [ | here | ]. 
  Abstracts are to be returned one week before the full paper deadline. Submit your abstract via the Easy Chair system. You are required to fill out authors, a title, abstract and keywords. You can include the same information in a pdf. 
  Submit your full paper by updating the EasyChair Abstract with your manuscript file. Abstract submissions that do not contain a manuscript will be automatically rejected at the beginning of the review time. 
  Papers must be submitted through the EasyChair platform: TBA 
  Double submissions policy: The work submitted to ICCC should not be under review in another scientific conference or journal at the time of submission. 
   
 Camera-Ready Submission Instructions  
 To submit the camera-ready version, login in EasyChair platform, select your paper, click “update file” and upload the camera-ready version of your paper.

 GDPR data processing information clause  

  In pursuance of the requirements included in Articles 13 and 14 of the Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, on the protection of natural persons with respect to the processing of personal data and the free flow of such data, as well as the repealing of Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter referred to as GDPR), we inform you about the processing of your personal data at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.  
   
  A. Information on the identity of the Data Controller   
   
  Within the meaning of the GDPR, the Data Controller is the entity that decides on the purposes for which personal data is processed as well as the means of processing it. The Controller of the data is Wrocław University of Science and Technology, with its registered seat at Wybrzeże Wyspiańskiego 27 in Wrocław. Contacting the Controller's representative is possible by writing a letter to the address of the Controller's registered seat as well as by using the contact form on the webpage pwr.edu.pl/contact  . The Controller has appointed a Data Protection Officer, whom you can contact with respect to matters of data protection using the following e-mail address: IOD@pwr.edu.pl  or by writing a letter to the Controller's registered office address.  
   
  B. The rights of persons being data subjects   
   
  The Controller ensures that the data subjects whose data it processes have the rights as set out in the GDPR. According to the basis of processing, these may be rights to: . access, correct, and rectify their data, 
  erase their data (in the event of withdrawal of consent – if there were no other legal basis for processing), 
  restrict the processing of their data if it appeared that the data is unnecessary to us or the processing thereof is objected to by the data subject, or it is incorrect, or if it appeared that it is unlawfully processed; however, the processing cannot be effectively restricted if it is necessary to protect the claims of the Data Controller or the rights of another person, or if it is necessary for important reasons related to the public interest; 
  transfer their data by means of a commonly used machine-readable computer format, provided that the Controller processes the data electronically and that it is technically feasible, 
  object to the processing on grounds of the data subject’s particular situation; this right may be exercised when the data is processed only to pursue the legitimate legal interests of the Data Controller; with regard to data used for direct marketing purposes, it is not even necessary to invoke any particular situation. 
  Most of these rights are not absolute. Specified below are detailed explanations of the data subject’s rights as well as information on how to exercise them. In the event of a request to exercise a specific right, the Controller will respond within one month, but, if necessary, we are entitled to extend this period by a further two months. If the response time is extended, the Controller will notify the data subject of this fact within one month of receipt of the request. The data subject can exercise their rights by contacting us using the contact form specified above. In the event of queries concerning the processing of personal data or the need to exercise your rights under the GDPR, you should contact a representative of the Controller (iccci@pwr.edu.pl). If there is any doubt as to the identity of the person contacting the Controller, additional information or proof of identity may be required.  
   
  C. Legal basis of personal data processing   
   
  When someone decides to participate in an event organised by WUST, their personal data is collected. Typically, the scope of the data includes, in particular, first name and surname, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, and other contact details, organisational affiliation and, if necessary, other data – such as specific dietary expectations or need for other forms of support from the organiser, accommodation details, payment methods and credit card information for hotel bookings, etc. – needed for the organisation of the event. If the participant in the event does not enter into an agreement with the Data Controller, the basis for the processing of the data will be the participant's consent  (in connection with Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR).  
  If relevant regulations, registration rules, or the very nature of the event (e.g. a ticketed career expo) prevent one from assuming that the provision of data is tantamount to giving consent to its processing, the Data Controller will ask for separate, additional consent to the processing of personal data for specific purposes. Personal data of participants in specific events may also be shared with other co-organisers of the event since, as a rule, institutions of the scientific world actively cooperate in such activities.  
   
  D. Recipients of the personal data   
   
  Participants' data may be used to register their participation, make materials available, provide additional services, and provide communication services (it may be made available to providers of services such as e-mail, instant messaging, etc.).  
  Participants’ likeness and voice may be recorded in the form of photographic and video material and used on the organisers' websites and in press reports. If the participant does not wish to disclose their identity and does not accept the use of such data, they should – before sharing their information – confirm the possibility of opting out of such processing of their data with the organiser’s representative.  
  Participants' data may also be made available to sponsors and used to enable the presentation of offers, but – as a general rule – (unless the organiser informs otherwise) these will be the purposes of other data controllers.

  In turn, a two page extract from this guide you can find here  .  
   
  Please note that the members the ICCCI International Program Committee are asked to give special attention to plagiarism and self-plagiarism while reviewing papers submitted to the conference.  
   
  Moreover, Springer routinely uses the iThenticate software ( www.ithenticate.com  ) to detect irregularities in papers received for publication in the LNCS/LNAI Proceedings.  

  Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 In adherence to our conference policy, the publication of papers containing text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) is strictly prohibited.  
   
  ICCCI conference submissions go through a comprehensive two-stage evaluation process. Initial assessments are carried out by International Program Committee members in the first stage, followed by Metareview Board members in the second stage. These reviewers are explicitly instructed to verify that the submitted papers are not generated by artificial intelligence (AI).

 Sessions  

  Main Track  
 The scope of ICCCI 2025 includes all topics related with processing data and knowledge from autonomous sources, especially in: collective processing, knowledge integration, data integration, group decision making, multi-criteria decision making consensus computing, and social networks.  
 ICCCI 2025 will consist of regular sessions with technical contributions reviewed and selected by an international program committee, as well as of invited keynote presented by leading scientists.  
 Special Sessions  
 The ICCCI 2025 invites proposals for Special Sessions to be held during the conference.  
 They intend to provide researchers in focused areas the opportunity to present and discuss their work, as well as to offer a forum for interaction among a broader community of researchers. A Special Session or Workshop will consist of a group of papers in a sub-discipline of Intelligent Information and Database Systems related to the main topics of ICCCI 2025.  
 Please send the Special Session proposals to Bogumiła Hnatkowska (bogumila.hnatkowska@pwr.edu.pl) with the following information:  
 Title & acronym of the special session 
  Brief profiles of special session organizers 
  General description of the special session scope 
  List of topics 
  Proposed Session Program Committee (to be invited) 
   
  The papers will be required to meet the same standards as ICCCI 2025 papers and will be published in the conference proceedings, in a bound volume by Springer-Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Communications in Computer and Information Science CCIS series.  
 All the Special Sessions and Doctoral Track will be centralized as tracks in the same conference submission and reviewing system as the regular papers.  
 The organizers will be responsible for the advertisement and promotion of the special session and the conference including the Special Session webpage preparation.  
 The review process for the conference is highly rigorous. It comprises two phases: we gather reviews from reviewers, and in the second phase submissions and reviews are re-evaluated by the Meta-reviewing Committee. Although the Organizers of Special Sessions are responsible for the review process, the final decision regarding acceptance will be made by the ICCCI Program Committee.  
 These rules aim to select the best papers and ensure the highest quality of the chosen papers. Our review model ensures that papers from both the Main Track and Special Sessions are held to an equally high standard.

 Language matters  
 At the IAS, we actively use language that puts people first. This is because words have power: they bestow or remove dignity, build or break stigma, and divide or unite the HIV response. Through the words we choose to use at the IAS, we acknowledge that a person is so much more than a condition; we promote inclusivity, dialogue and equality.

 Disseminating the latest research  

 We make the latest HIV knowledge available to a wide audience  

 Recognizing the importance of widespread knowledge exchange, the IAS offers two programmes to share the latest HIV research with a broad audience.  
 The Journal of the International AIDS Society  (JIAS)  , a renowned open-access scientific journal, covers various aspects of HIV science, with a special focus on implementation science.  
 The IAS Educational Fund  aims to facilitate bridging the gap between evidence-based science, policy and action. It keeps regional stakeholders updated on the latest HIV research through workshops, symposia and webinars. The fund also provides inclusive educational opportunities to key stakeholders through mentorship opportunities and scholarships for IAS conferences.

 Please address questions regarding a specific symposium or a SAC symposium track to the respective symposium co-chairs or the SAC symposium track chairs listed on the conference website.  
 Please make sure to follow the Author and Submission Guidelines listed below.  
 IEEE ICC 2025 will feature a series of half and full-day workshops. The aim of the conference workshops is to emphasize emerging topics that are not specifically covered in the main symposia.

  AUTHOR AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES   
 All papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 PLEASE NOTE: To be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted workshop paper is required to register for the conference at the “Workshop Registration” rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
   
  During the initial paper submission process, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on th paper registration page. In particular, the paper registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 IMPORTANT:  
 The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.  
 All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than one (1) additional printed page (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra page (the 7th page) will incur an over length page charge of US$100. All final papers must be submitted to the IEEE Conference eXpress website. Please refer to the acceptance letter for the instructions on how to upload final papers.

 Title: Advances for the Automatic discovery of Interesting and useful patterns in data   
 Abstract:  Intelligent systems and electronic tools can play an important role in various domains such as for factory automation, e-business, and manufacturing. To build intelligent systems and tools, high-quality data is generally required. Moreover, these systems need to process complex data and can yield large amounts of data such usage logs, images, videos, and data collected from industrial sensors. Managing this data to gain insights and improve these systems is thus a key challenge. It is also desirable to be able to extract information or models from data that are easily understandable by humans. Based on these objectives, this talk will discuss the use of data mining algorithms for discovering interesting and useful patterns in data generated from intelligent systems and other applications.  
 The talk will first briefly review early study on designing algorithms for identifying frequent patterns. Then, an overview of recent challenges and advances will be presented to identify other types of interesting patterns in more complex data such as sequences and dynamic graphs. Topics that will be discussed include high utility patterns, locally interesting patterns, and periodic patterns. Lastly, the SPMF open-source software will be mentioned and opportunities related to the combination of pattern mining algorithms with traditional artificial intelligence for intelligent systems will be discussed.

 Title：Exploring the Generalizability of Computational Models for Visual Perception   
 Abstract:  Traditional machine learning algorithms have achieved great success on various vision tasks under identical and independent (IID) assumption. However, most cases in the real world are incompatible with IID assumption, i.e., the probability distributions of training data and testing data are different. It leads to tremendous performance degradation due to domain shift. Domain generalization is a promising way to deal with domain shift in the unknown task domain is necessary. This talk gives some of our recent work about domain generalization. First, a dynamic domain generalization framework by integrating dynamic networks is presented. Furthermore, a semi-supervised domain generalization algorithm is proposed for some unlabeled source domain. Some experimental results have also been shown in the talk to evaluate our proposed algorithms.

 Title: Domain Adaptive object detection in the open world   
 Abstract:  Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) focuses on improving the generalization ability of object detectors via knowledge transfer. Recent advances in DAOD strive to change the emphasis of the adaptation process from global to local in virtue of fine-grained feature alignment methods. However, both the global and local alignment approaches fail to capture the topological relations among different foreground objects as the explicit dependencies and interactions between and within domains are neglected. In this case, only seeking one-vs-one alignment does not necessarily ensure the precise knowledge transfer. Moreover, conventional alignment-based approaches may be vulnerable to catastrophic overfitting regarding those less transferable regions (e.g. backgrounds) due to the accumulation of inaccurate localization results in the target domain. To remedy these issues, we first formulate DAOD as an open-set domain adaptation problem, in which the foregrounds and backgrounds are seen as the “known classes” and “unknown class” respectively. Accordingly, we propose a new and general framework for DAOD, named Foreground-aware Graph-based Relational Reasoning (FGRR), which incorporates graph structures into the detection pipeline to explicitly model the intra- and inter-domain foreground object relations on both pixel and semantic spaces, thereby endowing the DAOD model with the capability of relational reasoning beyond the popular alignment-based paradigm. FGRR first identifies the foreground pixels and regions by searching reliable correspondence and cross-domain similarity regularization respectively. The inter-domain visual and semantic correlations are hierarchically modeled via bipartite graph structures, and the intra-domain relations are encoded via graph attention mechanisms. Through message-passing, each node aggregates semantic and contextual information from the same and opposite domain to substantially enhance its expressive power. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed FGRR exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on four DAOD benchmarks.

 Title: Data to Energy: How to Manage and Analyze Energy Information   
 Abstract:  Energy data is a rich source of insights for enhancing energy efficiency, reliability, security, and sustainability. However, energy data also poses many challenges, such as data integration, data analysis, data visualization, data prediction, and data decision making. In this talk, a data intelligence approach for smart energy systems will be introduced, which involves modeling, collecting, cleansing, integrating, understanding, predicting, and acting on energy data. Some applications of data intelligence for smart energy systems will be showcased, such as smart meter data analytics system, spatiotemporal visual analysis tool for energy consumption patterns, and spatiotemporal energy demand prediction. Moreover, the role of visual analytics in understanding energy consumption patterns from spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal dimensions will be highlighted. A novel potential flow based method to model energy demand shift patterns across spatial and temporal dimensions will be demonstrated. With this method and tool, users can interactively discover the spatiotemporal variability of energy demand, customer groups, and demand shift patterns across different geographical areas and time horizons. The talk will conclude with some future directions and opportunities for advancing the field of data to energy.

 Title:  Physics-informed Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
 Abstract:  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable non-invasive and non- radioactive diagnosis tool in biomedical imaging. One of its fundamental problem is the relatively slow imaging speed. To accelerate the imaging, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods try to learn nonlinear mappings from the undersampled data to the artifacts-free images and/or spectra. However, due to the lack of high-quality or even unavailable training data, AI encounters bottleneck in challenging scenarios (e.g., motion   artifacts,   low   signal-to-noise   ratio,   and   novel   imaging   sequences). How to break through this data bottleneck, achieve interpretable and trusted   AI are frontier issues. This lecture focuses on a new paradigm for computational MRI, the physics-informed AI (PIAI) that can learn physical rule of MRI signal generation. Starting from the MRI Bloch differential equations, two main PIAI forms, implicit learning with physics-driven synthetic data and explicit learning with differential equations will be discussed. PIAI is expected to provide physics interpretable and reliable AI imaging, boosting the next generation development of MRI equipment and precision medicine.

  AUTHOR AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES   
 All papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 PLEASE NOTE: To be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted workshop paper is required to register for the conference at the “Workshop Registration” rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE ICC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
   
  During the initial paper submission process, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on th paper registration page. In particular, the paper registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all papers must be submitted to the official ICC 2025 submission system.  
 IMPORTANT:  
 The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.  
 All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than one (1) additional printed page (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra page (the 7th page) will incur an over length page charge of US$100. All final papers must be submitted to the IEEE Conference eXpress website. Please refer to the acceptance letter for the instructions on how to upload final papers.

 Warning: Fake ICCSA Conference by WASET   
  We have noticed the existence of organisations such as WASET that run fake “conferences” in order to make profit with the registration fees, often spoofing the names of real conferences. WASET claims to be organising a conference called ICCSA next year, which is a FAKE ICCSA conference.  
  The Real ICCSA conference has been organised by the ICCSA Society since 2003. We do not have any involvement with WASET. Please spread this news to your contacts and communities so that nobody mistakenly participates to such fake conferences.  
  WASET is predator publisher. Go to this Wiki Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology

 “Making Complex Systems tractable through Computational Science”  
 The International Conference on Computational Science  is an annual conference that brings together researchers and scientists from mathematics and computer science as basic computing disciplines, as well as from other various application areas, who are pioneering computational methods in sciences such as physics, chemistry, life sciences, and engineering, as well as in arts and humanitarian fields, to discuss problems and solutions in the area, identify new issues, and shape future directions for research.  
 ICCS 2025 in Singapore, will be the twenty-fifth edition in this series of highly successful conferences.  
 Since its inception in 2001, ICCS has attracted increasingly higher quality and numbers of attendees and papers. The average attendance each year is about 350 participants. The proceedings series have become a major intellectual resource for computational science researchers and serve to define and advance the state of the art of the field. An archive of the previous meetings is available through the Previous ICCS conferences page  .  
 Out of the submitted full papers to the main conference and workshops, we will select some 30% high-quality papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings. These are published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series  and indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services  . The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers.  
 As the conference theme this year is “Making Complex Systems tractable through Computational Science”  , papers highlighting the role of Computational Science in tackling the complex problems of today and tomorrow are particularly welcome.  
 This conference will be a unique event focusing on recent developments in: scalable scientific algorithms; advanced software tools; computational grids; advanced numerical methods; and novel application areas. These innovative novel models, algorithms and tools drive new science through efficient application in areas such as physical systems, computational and systems biology, environmental systems, finance, and others.  
 ICCS is co-organised with the Workshops on Computational Science, a set of thematic satellite events that focus on particular aspects of computational science. These workshops provide a way to explore novel areas of computational science and bring communities together around particular sub-topics of the field. For more information please see the call for workshops.  
 ICCS is committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion in the conference, without regard to race, age, religion, ethnicity, nationality, ability, gender identity, sexual orientation, or gender expression.  
 We look forward to welcoming you to ICCS 2025 in Singapore!

 ICCS is co-organised with the Workshops on Computational Science, a set of thematic satellite events that focus on particular aspects of computational science. You can submit your paper to either the Main Conference or any of the Workshops via the same EasyChair link. You can also choose to submit a Full/Short Paper  or an Abstract  . Please see the table above for the differences between each submission type.  
 Do also note that:   
  1.  ICCS and WCS (Workshops on Computational Science) papers will be published in separate proceedings, that is, there will be a LNCS publication for the Main Conference, and a different LNCS publication for the Workshops. But both ICCS and WCS will be published by LNCS, and indexed in the same way.  
  2.  The only difference between Full and Short papers is the number of accepted pages. They are otherwise published and indexed in the exact same way.  
 While we encourage full paper submissions, the “ Abstract Only  ” option caters to researchers who can only publish in specific journals or work for companies in circumstances such that they cannot publish at all, but still want to present their work and discuss it with their peers at ICCS. In the “Abstract Only” option, a short abstract is included in the conference program, but not in LNCS.  
 After the conference, the best papers will be invited for a special issue of the Journal of Computational Science  (Impact Factor: 3.1)  
  Instructions for Authors  
 The manuscripts of up to 15 pages  , written in English  and formatted according to the Springer LNCS templates, should be submitted electronically via EasyChair.  .  
 The most recent versions of the Templates  are available for download from this link  .  
  The LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates  are also available in the scientific authoring platform Overleaf.  
  Please also make sure to follow Springer’s authors’ guidelines  , as well as Springer’s Book Authors’ Code of Conduct  .  
 Papers must be based on unpublished original work and must be submitted to ICCS only. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper.   
 Do also note that ICCS lays crucial emphasis on the explicit relevance of submitted contributions to Computational Science  . All submissions to the conference, whether to the main conference or to the workshops, will be evaluated for this relevance (through a mandatory field in the submission form). Papers that are more relevant to specialized conferences on very specific topics will be desk-rejected before the standard review process begins.  
 To promote open science and to facilitate reproducibility, ICCS encourages data and code sharing. Please keep this in mind when submitting your papers.  
 Deadlines  for draft paper submission, notification of acceptance, camera-ready paper submission and registration may be found in the Important Dates  section.  
 For the camera-ready version, please note that:   
 ICCS authors interested in | open access for their papers (open choice) | have the possibility to do so. When you submit your camera-ready paper, if you intend to make it open access, | contact us | and we will tell you how to proceed. 
  Springer encourages authors to include their | ORCIDs | in their papers. 
  Springer is now offering the inclusion of | embedded videos | in proceedings papers.
