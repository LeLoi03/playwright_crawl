  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

 VISSOFT 2011 Paper Highlights   
 Posted on  February 1, 2012   by  Fabian Beck     
   VISSOFT 2011  , the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, took place in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, September 29-30, 2011 and was co-located with ICSM 2011  . The proceedings are available in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library  . Of the 21 full papers submitted to the workshop, nine were accepted (acceptance rate: 42%).  
 This post is by Fabian Beck  a new contributor to the SoftVis blog and presents the nine full papers of VISSOFT 2011 in form of a structured review.  
 Code Dependencies  
 Dependencies between source code artifacts provide insights in the structure of a software system. Visualizing them is challenging because of the sheer quantity of dependencies usually included in a system. Often the hierarchical organization of the system (e.g., a hierarchical package structure) helps to structure or simplify these dependencies. Among the papers presented at VISSOFT 2011, many involve the visualization of code dependencies, the following three, however, having them in particular focus.  
 Caserta et al.  use the hierarchical organization to map the source code artifacts to a two-dimensional plane exploiting a city metaphor. On top of this plane, in the third dimension, they draw the dependencies that link the artifacts. The authors reduce the visual complexity of the diagram by bundling the dependencies, again using the hierarchical structure of the artifacts. Such hierarchical edge bundling is also used in the approach by Beck F. et al.  , which focuses on comparing different types of code dependencies. They arrange the hierarchically structured artifacts linearly from top to bottom. Each type of dependency is depicted in a narrow stripe. By arranging the stripes side-by-side these types can be visually compared. The idea of depicting different types of dependencies is also present in the approach by Erdemir et al.  They link those dependencies to different quality metrics by encoding them in the shape, color, texture, etc., of the nodes. A distinguishing feature of their approach is the intuitive mapping between metrics and visual attributes.

  Ural Erdemir | , | Umut Tekin | , | Feza Buzluca | : E-Quality: A graph based object oriented software quality visualization tool. | [publisher] 
  Dynamic Program Behavior  
 The analysis of the dynamic behavior of software systems is usually facing even larger sets of data than the analysis of static code dependencies. Visualization approaches depicting such dynamic data, hence, have to apply some form of aggregation to handle the data. As the following two examples show, this aggregation can be realized in different ways.  
 Code Dependencies can be enriched by dynamic information, for instance, as demonstrated by Deng et al.  : They enforce structural dependencies if the connected code entities are covered by the same set of test cases. This dynamic relational information is only used to arrange a large set of code entities onto a two-dimensional plane. For reasons of scalability, their visualization shows these entities as color-coded dots, but does not depict dependencies. Choudhury and Rosen  introduce an animated visualization technique for representing runtime memory transactions of a program. Elements of accessed data, visually encoded as glyphs, move between levels of a simulated cache. These glyphs form abstract visual structures that provide insights into the composition and eviction of the cache. The authors suggest that their approach fosters program comprehension with respect to the dynamic behavior of the program.

  A. N. M. Imroz Choudhury | , | Paul Rosen | : Abstract visualization of runtime memory behavior. | [PDF] 
  Visual Analytics Tools & Case Studies  
 Over the last decade, many software visualization approaches have been proposed, but only very few of them reached wide impact in practice. A reason could be that academia did not sufficiently embed those visualizations into real-world scenarios and development processes. The following analytics tools and case studies might lessen this gap.  
 When gaining information by visually analyzing a software system, a software developer wants to react to these new insights. Beck M. et al.  introduce a tool for planning the reengineering of a software system, that is, changing the software design at a high level. Their tool is also based on a visualization of code dependencies attached with a hierarchy. The innovative features of their approach are the flexible interaction techniques for changing the hierarchy (i.e., the software design). Also Broeksema and Telea  target at supporting developers in changing a software system: They investigate the effort to port a system from an older version of a library to a newer one. Their visualization, which they implemented as an IDE plug-in for KDevelop, provides an overview on the necessary changes and guide the developer to realize them.  
 Neu et al.  study not only single software projects, but the ecosystems the individual projects are embedded in. They developed a web application that visualizes the evolution of such ecosystems. As an extensive case study, the GNOME project is analyzed. Long practiced but only recently considered as a serious development method, sketches are explored by Walny et al.  In semi-structured interviews they evaluated how software developers in academia use these ad-hoc software visualizations. The interviews reveal that sketches are applied in a broad spectrum of scenarios and are often saved and reused in later stages of development.

  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

 VISSOFT 2011 Paper Highlights   
 Posted on  February 1, 2012   by  Fabian Beck     
   VISSOFT 2011  , the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, took place in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, September 29-30, 2011 and was co-located with ICSM 2011  . The proceedings are available in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library  . Of the 21 full papers submitted to the workshop, nine were accepted (acceptance rate: 42%).  
 This post is by Fabian Beck  a new contributor to the SoftVis blog and presents the nine full papers of VISSOFT 2011 in form of a structured review.  
 Code Dependencies  
 Dependencies between source code artifacts provide insights in the structure of a software system. Visualizing them is challenging because of the sheer quantity of dependencies usually included in a system. Often the hierarchical organization of the system (e.g., a hierarchical package structure) helps to structure or simplify these dependencies. Among the papers presented at VISSOFT 2011, many involve the visualization of code dependencies, the following three, however, having them in particular focus.  
 Caserta et al.  use the hierarchical organization to map the source code artifacts to a two-dimensional plane exploiting a city metaphor. On top of this plane, in the third dimension, they draw the dependencies that link the artifacts. The authors reduce the visual complexity of the diagram by bundling the dependencies, again using the hierarchical structure of the artifacts. Such hierarchical edge bundling is also used in the approach by Beck F. et al.  , which focuses on comparing different types of code dependencies. They arrange the hierarchically structured artifacts linearly from top to bottom. Each type of dependency is depicted in a narrow stripe. By arranging the stripes side-by-side these types can be visually compared. The idea of depicting different types of dependencies is also present in the approach by Erdemir et al.  They link those dependencies to different quality metrics by encoding them in the shape, color, texture, etc., of the nodes. A distinguishing feature of their approach is the intuitive mapping between metrics and visual attributes.

  Fabian Beck | , | Radoslav Petkov | , | Stephan Diehl | : Visually exploring multi-dimensional code couplings. | [PDF] 
  Ural Erdemir | , | Umut Tekin | , | Feza Buzluca | : E-Quality: A graph based object oriented software quality visualization tool. | [publisher] 
  Dynamic Program Behavior  
 The analysis of the dynamic behavior of software systems is usually facing even larger sets of data than the analysis of static code dependencies. Visualization approaches depicting such dynamic data, hence, have to apply some form of aggregation to handle the data. As the following two examples show, this aggregation can be realized in different ways.  
 Code Dependencies can be enriched by dynamic information, for instance, as demonstrated by Deng et al.  : They enforce structural dependencies if the connected code entities are covered by the same set of test cases. This dynamic relational information is only used to arrange a large set of code entities onto a two-dimensional plane. For reasons of scalability, their visualization shows these entities as color-coded dots, but does not depict dependencies. Choudhury and Rosen  introduce an animated visualization technique for representing runtime memory transactions of a program. Elements of accessed data, visually encoded as glyphs, move between levels of a simulated cache. These glyphs form abstract visual structures that provide insights into the composition and eviction of the cache. The authors suggest that their approach fosters program comprehension with respect to the dynamic behavior of the program.

  A. N. M. Imroz Choudhury | , | Paul Rosen | : Abstract visualization of runtime memory behavior. | [PDF] 
  Visual Analytics Tools & Case Studies  
 Over the last decade, many software visualization approaches have been proposed, but only very few of them reached wide impact in practice. A reason could be that academia did not sufficiently embed those visualizations into real-world scenarios and development processes. The following analytics tools and case studies might lessen this gap.  
 When gaining information by visually analyzing a software system, a software developer wants to react to these new insights. Beck M. et al.  introduce a tool for planning the reengineering of a software system, that is, changing the software design at a high level. Their tool is also based on a visualization of code dependencies attached with a hierarchy. The innovative features of their approach are the flexible interaction techniques for changing the hierarchy (i.e., the software design). Also Broeksema and Telea  target at supporting developers in changing a software system: They investigate the effort to port a system from an older version of a library to a newer one. Their visualization, which they implemented as an IDE plug-in for KDevelop, provides an overview on the necessary changes and guide the developer to realize them.  
 Neu et al.  study not only single software projects, but the ecosystems the individual projects are embedded in. They developed a web application that visualizes the evolution of such ecosystems. As an extensive case study, the GNOME project is analyzed. Long practiced but only recently considered as a serious development method, sketches are explored by Walny et al.  In semi-structured interviews they evaluated how software developers in academia use these ad-hoc software visualizations. The interviews reveal that sketches are applied in a broad spectrum of scenarios and are often saved and reused in later stages of development.

 📣 Upcoming Edition: VISSOFT 2025  @ Auckland, New Zealand  
  Mission  
 Software visualization is a broad research area encompassing concepts, methods, tools, and techniques that assist in a range of software engineering and software development activities. Covered aspects include the development and evaluation of approaches for visually analyzing software and software systems, including their structure, execution behavior, and evolution.  
 The VISSOFT IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization continues the history of the ACM SOFTVIS Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE VISSOFT International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis. The conference focuses on visualization techniques that target aspects of software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and reengineering, i.e., how visualization helps professionals to understand, analyze, test and evolve software. We aim to gather tool developers, experts, users, and researchers from software engineering, information visualization, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. We seek technical papers, empirical studies, applications, or case studies and provide a platform for presenting novel research ideas and tools.

 VISSOFT 2011 Paper Highlights   
 Posted on  February 1, 2012   by  Fabian Beck     
   VISSOFT 2011  , the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, took place in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, September 29-30, 2011 and was co-located with ICSM 2011  . The proceedings are available in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library  . Of the 21 full papers submitted to the workshop, nine were accepted (acceptance rate: 42%).  
 This post is by Fabian Beck  a new contributor to the SoftVis blog and presents the nine full papers of VISSOFT 2011 in form of a structured review.  
 Code Dependencies  
 Dependencies between source code artifacts provide insights in the structure of a software system. Visualizing them is challenging because of the sheer quantity of dependencies usually included in a system. Often the hierarchical organization of the system (e.g., a hierarchical package structure) helps to structure or simplify these dependencies. Among the papers presented at VISSOFT 2011, many involve the visualization of code dependencies, the following three, however, having them in particular focus.  
 Caserta et al.  use the hierarchical organization to map the source code artifacts to a two-dimensional plane exploiting a city metaphor. On top of this plane, in the third dimension, they draw the dependencies that link the artifacts. The authors reduce the visual complexity of the diagram by bundling the dependencies, again using the hierarchical structure of the artifacts. Such hierarchical edge bundling is also used in the approach by Beck F. et al.  , which focuses on comparing different types of code dependencies. They arrange the hierarchically structured artifacts linearly from top to bottom. Each type of dependency is depicted in a narrow stripe. By arranging the stripes side-by-side these types can be visually compared. The idea of depicting different types of dependencies is also present in the approach by Erdemir et al.  They link those dependencies to different quality metrics by encoding them in the shape, color, texture, etc., of the nodes. A distinguishing feature of their approach is the intuitive mapping between metrics and visual attributes.

  Ural Erdemir | , | Umut Tekin | , | Feza Buzluca | : E-Quality: A graph based object oriented software quality visualization tool. | [publisher] 
  Dynamic Program Behavior  
 The analysis of the dynamic behavior of software systems is usually facing even larger sets of data than the analysis of static code dependencies. Visualization approaches depicting such dynamic data, hence, have to apply some form of aggregation to handle the data. As the following two examples show, this aggregation can be realized in different ways.  
 Code Dependencies can be enriched by dynamic information, for instance, as demonstrated by Deng et al.  : They enforce structural dependencies if the connected code entities are covered by the same set of test cases. This dynamic relational information is only used to arrange a large set of code entities onto a two-dimensional plane. For reasons of scalability, their visualization shows these entities as color-coded dots, but does not depict dependencies. Choudhury and Rosen  introduce an animated visualization technique for representing runtime memory transactions of a program. Elements of accessed data, visually encoded as glyphs, move between levels of a simulated cache. These glyphs form abstract visual structures that provide insights into the composition and eviction of the cache. The authors suggest that their approach fosters program comprehension with respect to the dynamic behavior of the program.

  A. N. M. Imroz Choudhury | , | Paul Rosen | : Abstract visualization of runtime memory behavior. | [PDF] 
  Visual Analytics Tools & Case Studies  
 Over the last decade, many software visualization approaches have been proposed, but only very few of them reached wide impact in practice. A reason could be that academia did not sufficiently embed those visualizations into real-world scenarios and development processes. The following analytics tools and case studies might lessen this gap.  
 When gaining information by visually analyzing a software system, a software developer wants to react to these new insights. Beck M. et al.  introduce a tool for planning the reengineering of a software system, that is, changing the software design at a high level. Their tool is also based on a visualization of code dependencies attached with a hierarchy. The innovative features of their approach are the flexible interaction techniques for changing the hierarchy (i.e., the software design). Also Broeksema and Telea  target at supporting developers in changing a software system: They investigate the effort to port a system from an older version of a library to a newer one. Their visualization, which they implemented as an IDE plug-in for KDevelop, provides an overview on the necessary changes and guide the developer to realize them.  
 Neu et al.  study not only single software projects, but the ecosystems the individual projects are embedded in. They developed a web application that visualizes the evolution of such ecosystems. As an extensive case study, the GNOME project is analyzed. Long practiced but only recently considered as a serious development method, sketches are explored by Walny et al.  In semi-structured interviews they evaluated how software developers in academia use these ad-hoc software visualizations. The interviews reveal that sketches are applied in a broad spectrum of scenarios and are often saved and reused in later stages of development.

 WABI 2024  
   
 Scope  
 WABI is an international Conference covering research in algorithmic  work in bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology. The emphasis is mainly on discrete algorithms and machine learning methods that address important problems in molecular biology, that are founded on sound models, that are computationally efficient, and that provide evidence of their potential usefulness in practice, preferably by testing on appropriately chosen simulated or real datasets. The goal is to present recent research results, including significant work-in-progress, and to identify and explore directions of future research. This year it is co-located with ALGO 2024.  
 Important Dates  
  
 Paper submission deadline: May 26  (Anywhere on Earth)

 Keynote Speaker  
   Tomás Vinar  , Comenius University  
 Title  : Bioinformatics of Pathogens  
 Abstract  : Genomic sequencing has become an important tool in identification and surveillance of human pathogens. Compared to large organisms, where our goal is to obtain high-quality sequences for detailed analysis, in pathogen sequencing the emphasis is often on optimization of cost and time. Consequently, sequencing of pathogens creates interesting computational challenges and development of new methods has a potential to significantly enhance applicability of the results in epidemiology and clinical practice. In my talk, I will give two examples: plasmid identification in bacterial isolates and genomic surveillance of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2. In both cases, application of better algorithms and modeling helps to improve the quality of analysis of very noisy data.  
  
 Invited Speaker  
   Giulia  Bernardini  , University of Trieste  
 Title  : Solving phylogenetic problems through graph theory: two case studies  
 Abstract  : In this talk, I will showcase two problems arising in Phylogenetics that get efficient solutions via reductions to well-studied problems on bipartite graphs. First, I will introduce the incomplete directed perfect phylogeny problem, asking to complete missing entries in a species-characters binary matrix so as to reconstruct a directed perfect phylogeny. I will demonstrate how this problem can be solved in linear time by designing a specialized dynamic connectivity data structure on bipartite graphs. The second problem asks to compute the permutation distance between two isomorphic, fully labelled phylogenetic trees. I will show how this task can be reduced to computing the largest cardinality matching in a sparse bipartite graph to obtain an efficient solution.

 Overview  

 Virtually every human-technology interaction, or sensor network, generates observations that are in some relation with each other. As a result, many data science problems can be viewed as a study of some properties of complex networks in which nodes represent the entities that are being studied and edges represent relations between these entities. Such networks are often large-scale, decentralized, and evolve dynamically over time. Modeling and mining complex networks in order to understand the principles governing the organization and the behaviour of such networks is crucial for a broad range of fields of study, including information and social sciences, economics, biology, and neuroscience.  
 The aim of the 20th Workshop on Modelling and Mining Networks (WAW 2025)  is to further the understanding of networks that arise in theoretical as well as applied domains. The goal is also to stimulate the development of high-performance and scalable algorithms that exploit these networks. The workshop welcomes the researchers who are working on graph-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of networks represented as graphs or hypergraphs and other higher order structures.  
 WAW 2025  will be held at the Vilnius University  , Vilnius, Lithuania.

 WAOA 2024  
   
 Scope  
 Approximation and online algorithms are fundamental tools to deal with computationally hard problems and problems in which the input is gradually disclosed over time. Both kinds of problems arise from a large number of applications in a variety of fields. The Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms (WAOA)  focuses on the design and analysis of approximation and online algorithms. It also covers experimental methods used to design and analyze efficient approximation and online algorithms.  
 WAOA 2024 is co-located with ALGO 2024  , which also hosts ESA  , ALGOCLOUD  , ALGOWIN  , ATMOS  , IPEC  , and WABI  . ALGO 2024 will take place at Royal Holloway, University of London  in Egham, United Kingdom.

  Title: | Advances in Approximation Algorithms for Tree and Connectivity Augmentation 
  Abstract: | Augmentation problems are a fundamental class of Network Design problems. The goal is to find a cheapest way to increase a graph’s (edge-)connectivity by adding edges from a given set of options. The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem is one of its most elementary examples, which can be interpreted as determining a cheapest way to increase the edge-connectivity of a graph from 0 to 1. The next step, to increase from 1 to 2, leads to the heavily studied Tree Augmentation Problem, and the more general problem of increasing the edge-connectivity by 1 of an arbitrary graph is known as Connectivity Augmentation. While these problems admit simple 2-approximations, obtaining approximation factors below 2 has proven challenging. This talk has several goals, namely: | Providing a brief introduction to Tree and Connectivity Augmentation. 
  Discussing relevant algorithmic techniques that have recently led to better-than-2 approximations for these problems, including the Relative Greedy method and an interesting connection of it to local search procedures. 
  Demonstrating how these techniques can be leveraged to obtain better-than-2 approximations for (weighted) augmentation problems.

 Submission guidelines  
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper of at most 10 pages excluding the title page, references, and an optional appendix. The submission should be typeset using a 10-point or larger font in a single-column format with ample spacing throughout and 2cm margins all around on A4-size paper. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in an appendix. This appendix can even comprise an entire full version of the paper. The appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.  
 Results previously published (or scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal will not be accepted at WAOA. Simultaneous submission to journals or other conferences with published proceedings is not permitted. By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance at least one of the authors must register at ALGO 2024, attend the conference onsite and present the paper. The program committee may award a Best Paper Award to one of the accepted papers.  
 Double-blind reviewing  
 The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
 COI with PC members  
 When submitting a paper, authors will be asked to indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  PC member owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent or recent collaborator (within last 5 years) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
    
 PC Submissions  
 Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed, but will be subject to a stricter review process.  
 Paper Submission and Proceedings  
 Papers should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system  . The WAOA 2024 proceedings  will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)  . Selected papers presented at WAOA 2024 will be invited to a special issue of Theory of Computing Systems  .

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 Author and Submission Guidelines  
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 PLEASE NOTE:  To be published in the IEEE WCNC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the FULL or LIMITED (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one FULL or LIMITED registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE WCNC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
 During the initial paper submission process via EDAS, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on the  EDAS registration page. In particular, the EDAS registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all submissions must be done through EDAS.  
 IMPORTANT:  The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.  
 All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than two (2) additional printed pages (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra pages (the 7th and 8th pages) will incur an over length page charge of US$100 for each page. All final papers must be submitted to the IEEE Conference eXpress website. Please refer to the acceptance letter for the instructions on how to upload final papers.  
 You may also use one of the following templates for Microsoft Word: A4, US letter.  
 Download Standard IEEE conference templates for LaTeX formats >>   
 If you have any questions regarding the submission of manuscripts, please contact one of the Technical Program Chairs of the Symposia that you are submitting a paper.

 Effects of Variations in 3D Spatial Search Techniques on Mobile Query Speed vs Accuracy    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 This paper presents three Spatial Search Algorithms for determiningthe three dimensional visibility shape (threat dome) at a user’s current locationin a built environment. Users then utilize this 3D shape as their query“window” to retrieve information on only those objects visible within a spatialdatabase. Visibility shape searching addresses the information overloadproblem by providing “Hidden Query Removal” functionality for mobile LBS.This functionality will be especially useful in the Web 4.0 era when trillions ofmicro-sensors become available for query through standard IP access.   

 ARCAMA-3D - A Context-Aware Augmented Reality Mobile Platform for Environmental Discovery    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.17-26 

 In this paper, we present ARCAMA-3D, a platform for 3D map-based visualization on mobile devices powered by augmented reality. The platform offers context-aware interactions related to the concept of ubiquitous computing. The general purpose of the project is to enable users to navigate in an area with their mobile devices and interactively discover their surroundings. The system integrates real-time sensing technologies (GPS and other embedded sensors) and exploits user's context and preferences in order to provide her with the necessary information. In return, the user consults the information (text, photo, audio or video files, etc.) that is published on the 3D model with the help of augmented reality. The innovative aspect of our approach lies in a light-weight 3D visualization system which is superimposed on the real scene. This approach facilitates the discovery of surroundings without preventing the visualization of real entities. We also alleviate the cognitive load of the user by avoiding the presentation of excessive information.   

 Speech and Multimodal Interaction in Mobile GIS Search: A Case of Study    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.27-32 

 The In this short paper we will present an Android mobile application making use of a multimodal interface. We base our application on a proprietary architecture based on the W3C recommendation MM-Framework. App-users can talk and use natural gestures on a mobile device touch screen in order to formulate a complex interrogation to a geo-referenced web service. The interaction produce as result a query whose origin is a semantically incomplete audio sentence complete by a deictic gesture (i.e.: "please, find all bus stops in this area - - while tapping or making a circle on the screen where a map is showed - -").   

 Asynchronous Ultrasonic Trilateration for Indoor Positioning of Mobile Phones    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 In this paper we discuss how the innate ability of mobile phone speakers to produce ultrasound can be used for accurate indoor positioning. The frequencies in question are in a range between 20 and 22 KHz, which is high enough to be inaudible by humans but still low enough to be generated by today’s mobile phone sound hardware. Our tests indicate that it is possible to generate the given range of frequencies without significant distortions, provided the signal volume is not turned excessively high. In this paper we present and evaluate the accuracy of our asynchronous trilateration method (Lok8) for mobile positioning without requiring knowledge of the time the ultrasonic signal was sent. This approach shows that only the differences in time of arrival to multiple microphones (control points) placed throughout the indoor environment is sufficient. Consequently, any timing issues with client and server synchronization are avoided.   

 A Semantic Resolver for Coordinate Reference Systems    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) are at the heart of geo services. A large number of very different CRSs is in active use worldwide. EPSG maintains a well-known inventory of geodetic CRSs upon which most service implementations and also the standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium rely. For recent data and services, however, this set turns out insufficient - time series, climate and ocean data, etc. require time axes and non-spatio-temporal axes in addition. Further, when retrieving slices from geo data cubes, new, unforeseen CRSs need to be constructed on the fly, such as lat/t or lon/z CRSs. To achieve a uniform handling of all CRSs we propose a URL-based identification scheme. This scheme naturally extends OGC’s EPSG identification URLs with parametrized CRSs and ad-hoc CRS and axis combination. Our approach currently is under discussion within OGC for adoption as a standard. We have implemented a CRS resolver based on this concept which accepts identification URLs and returns corresponding GML definitions. The resolver is available publicly to study and demonstrate feasibility of URL-based CRS naming schemes. In this paper we summarize the concept and implementation of the resolver as a service following the described name type specification.   

 Visualization with a New Visual Metaphor for Hierarchical and Stratified Temporal Domain    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.57-71 

 Studies have proved that 80% of data has a spatial reference [1] and it would be reasonable to assume that the temporal reference has a similar relevance. Spatio-temporal data visualization assumes an important role in the data presentation to users. Offering a synchronized view on three dimensions of data (i. e. descriptive, temporal and spatial) helps users in their knowledge discovery process. In some fields, like Cultural Heritage, time assumes an important role to explore data. The same timeline could be view in different thematic context, temporal domain could be stratified and the time reference could be qualitative and imprecise. Managing this kind of features improves the ability of the users to recognize pattern in data. In this paper is presented a spatio-temporal data visualization application that shows a new method to explore hierarchical and stratified temporal domains with imprecise temporal reference. The application interface offers a high level of personalization. Users can choose between different type of views and visual metaphors to compare objects on geobrowser activating or disabling layers of their interest. Interface is open and extendible to new kinds of visualization.

 Tag@Map: A Web-Based Application for Visually Analyzing Geographic Information through Georeferenced Tag Clouds    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.72-81 

 In their activities of monitoring a territory and its spatio-temporal phenomena, decision makers often face problems which require rapid solutions in spite of the complexity of scenarios under investigation. Researchers from the Geographic Information domain support their activities by providing them with highly interactive visualization tools able both to synthesize information from large datasets and perform complex analytical tasks. The goal of this paper is to present a Web-based application for on-line GeoVisual Analytics which exploits the visualization capability of the Tag Cloud technique, the interaction ability of visual environments, and the Web-based data querying and accessing. The application elaborates an interactive simplified map containing a georeferenced cloud of tags, placed where the associated information is appropriate and significant. By applying semantic and geographic operators on the map tags, users are allowed to acquire information about the underlying data, useful for a better comprehension of the described phenomena. A system prototype has been realized which builds an overview of data distribution and classification expressed as a georeferenced tag cloud. It also allows users to navigate and analyze maps through zooming and filtering operations defined in agreement with Visual Analytics guidelines.   

 Clustering User Trajectories to Find Patterns for Social Interaction Applications    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.82-97 

 Sharing of user data has substantially increased over the past few years facilitated by sophisticated Web and mobile applications, including social networks. For instance, users can easily register their trajectories over time based on their daily trips captured with GPS receivers as well as share and relate them with trajectories of other users. Analyzing user trajectories over time can reveal habits and preferences. This information can be used to recommend content to single users or to group users together based on similar trajectories and/or preferences. Recording GPS tracks generates very large amounts of data. Therefore clustering algorithms are required to efficiently analyze such data. In this paper, we focus on investigating ways of efficiently analyzing user trajectories and extracting user preferences from them. We demonstrate an algorithm for clustering user GPS trajectories. In addition, we propose an algorithm to correlate trajectories based on near points between two or more users. The obtained results provided interesting avenues for exploring Location-based Social Network (LBSN) applications.   

 Making a Pictorial and Verbal Travel Trace from a GPS Trace    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.98-115 

 This paper presents a system for making a pictorial and verbal representation of a travel trace from a GPS trace with the following functions: (1) A function to make a travel trace consisting of following paths and off-road paths, which indicate the turns and the reached districts. (2) A function that generates a partonomic tree that contains the sections of the travel trace, i.e. portions of the paths of the travel trace associated with verbal information, such as toponyms, route names, and district names. (3) A function that generates clickable labels that represent the sections of a travel trace in a map view. By using the labels, users can obtain detailed information while using a small map scale, understand the part-of relations among the administrative regions represented, and intuitively navigate the representation based on the verbalized sections. We have developed a prototype of the proposed system for a web-based interactive map service, which receives either a KML or a GPX file with a GPS trace, and provides a pictorial and verbal travel trace representation on a focus+glue+context map developed in our previous work. Using the prototype, we have confirmed the feasibility of the proposed system.   

 Event Processing and Real-Time Monitoring over Streaming Traffic Data    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.116-133 

 Tracking mobility of humans, animals or merchandise has recently given rise to a wide variety of location-based services and monitoring applications. In this paper, we particularly focus on real-time traffic surveillance over densely congested road networks in large metropolitan areas. In such a setting, streaming positional updates are being frequently relayed into a central server from numerous moving vehicles (buses, taxis, passenger cars etc.). Our analysis concerns two important aspects. First, we outline characteristics of a robust processing engine that is capable to efficiently manage such massive, transient, and perhaps noisy geospatial data. Our objective is to provide online aggregates and reliable estimates regarding the current traffic situation at multiple levels of resolution. At a second step, we design a framework for effective multi-modal dissemination of derived information to the end users, in the form of interactive maps for intuitive visualization as well as instant notifications via message feeds. As a proof of concept, we also report on our ongoing development of EPOPS; in its current version, this functional prototype of the proposed scheme is able to deliver cross-platform geographic, textual, and even multimedia content through web and smartphone interfaces.   

 A Context-Aware Web Content Generator Based on Personal Tracking    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 Context-awareness has been successfully included in the mobile phone applications due mainly to the presence of numerous sensors and the access to several communication networks. Therefore, we present a Context-Aware Web Content Generator Based on Personal Tracking, which uses the user context information obtained by mobile devices to generate content for a large number of web applications. While registering the trajectory followed by the mobile device, it allows users to create multimedia documents (e.g. photo, audio, video), which are connected to an enriched description of the user context (e.g. weather, location, date). Finally, all this data and documents are combined to produce a new content, which is published on the Web. We also show results of tests performed in a real scenario and describe our strategy to avoid battery overconsumption and memory overflow in mobile phones. Moreover, a user evaluation is presented in order to measure the system performance, in terms of precision and system overall usability.

  International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 In recent years, geographic information has entered the main-stream, deeply altering the pre-existing patterns of its production, dis-tribution, and consumption. Through web mapping, millions of online users utilise spatial data in interactive digital maps. The typical unit of visualisation of geo-data is a viewport, defined as a bi-dimensional image of a map, fixed at a given scale, in a rectangular frame. In a viewport, the user performs analytical tasks, observing individual map features, or drawing high-level judgements about the objects in the viewport as a whole. Current geographic information retrieval (GIR) systems aim at facilitating analytical tasks, and little emphasis is put on the retrieval and indexing of visualised units, i.e. viewports. In this paper we outline a holistic, viewport-based GIR system, offering an alternative approach to feature-based GIR. Such a system indexes viewports, rather than in-dividual map features, extracting descriptors of their high-level, overall semantics in a vector space model. This approach allows for efficient comparison, classification, clustering, and indexing of viewports. A case study describes in detail how our GIR system models viewports repre-senting geographical locations in Ireland. The results indicate advantages and limitations of the viewport-based approach, which allows for a novel exploration of geographic data, using holistic semantics.

 Fuelled by the quantity of available online spatial data that continues to grow, the requirement for filtering spatial content to match mobile users' context becomes increasingly important. This paper introduces a flexible algorithm to derive users' preferences in a mobile and distributed system. Such preferences are implicitly computed from users' virtual and physical interactions with spatial features. Using this concept, region profiles for specific spatial contexts can be generated and used to recommend content to those visiting that region. Our approach provides a set of profiles (personal and region-based) which are combined to adapt the presentation of a given service to suit users' immediate needs and interests. A proposed college campus navigation assistant illustrates the benefits of such an unobtrusive recommender system.

 In the framework of a geographic application displaying maps, there are several solutions for protecting a sensitive object. Sensitive objects can be hidden, masked, blurred or even replaced by fake objects. In this paper we suggest a framework to specify protection mechanisms to enforce whenever a prohibition is derived from the security policy. This framework includes (i) logical rules allowing us to derive protection mechanisms from prohibitions, and (ii) an algorithm which builds the map to display, according to the derived protection mechanisms.

 Information acquisition in a pervasive sensor network is often affected by faults due to power outage at nodes, wrong time synchronizations, interference, network transmission failures, sensor hardware issues or excessive energy consumption for communications. These issues impose a trade-off between the precision of the measurements and the costs of communication and processing which are directly proportional to the number of sensors and/or transmissions. We present a spatio-temporal interpolation technique which allows an accurate estimation of sensor network missing data by computing the inverse distance weighting of the trend cluster representation of the transmitted data. The trend-cluster interpolation has been evaluated in a real climate sensor network in order to prove the efficacy of our solution in reducing the amount of transmissions by guaranteeing accurate estimation of missing data.   

 Discovering Sensor Services with Social Network Analysis and Expanded SQWRL Querying    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) initiative enables access of sensor data over the Web. The growing amount of available sensors requires discovering mechanisms to find sensor services relevant for users. These mechanisms must rely on explicit sensor metadata model and address the problem of semantic heterogeneity. We present a new discovering approach that is based on a novel sensor metadata model compliant with SWE standards, where sensors' descriptions are referenced to a common semantic reference frame to support resolution of semantic heterogeneities. The discovery mechanism comprises two steps: first, a network-analysis-based partitioning algorithm modularizes the set of sensors into meaningful sensor clusters, which semantics is generated with aggregation operators. Secondly, an expanded SQWRL rule-based inference engine processes the queries over the sensor clusters and issues the relevant sensor services. This approach allows users to find the sensor services relevant to their needs.   

 Leveraging Power of Transmission for Range-Free Localization of Tiny Sensors    
   
 Conference Paper

  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.239-256 

 Modern environmental monitoring systems are being envisioned as constellations of tiny smart sensors, densely deployed on the territory to be monitored. Data provided by such sensors is meaningless if it is not equipped with information about the context to which it refers. Such a context is mainly related to the location of sensors, which allows to manage collected data by means of Geographic Information Systems. Due to scarce resources of tiny sensors characteristics, localization services are usually range-free and based on simple measurements provided by the majority of radio chips, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). However, existing solutions suffer of inaccuracy issues, due to the unreliability of the adopted indicators. This article proposes a range-free localization algorithm based on data fusion, which combines the RSSI with the Power of Transmission (PoT), by estimating the RSSI at different PoT levels. We show, through experimentation on real tiny devices, how this simple solution allows reducing the localization error to about 16% with respect to state-of-art algorithms.

 The systematic design of wireless indoor positioning systems can offer another essential approach to achieving the required performance objectives aside from using suitable location determination algorithms. This manuscript investigates Bluetooth Low Energy- (BLE-) based wireless indoor positioning systems and how adjusting the system design parameters can affect their location determination performance. Without placing emphasis on sophisticated location determination algorithms, this work provides guidelines for how a system designer can control the balance among multiple positioning performance metrics. For example, a balance between the number of installed reference nodes and the accuracy performance can be chosen to control deployment costs, such as the installation expense, infrastructure expense, and installation time. To demonstrate our baseline study, we compare three different designs of BLE wireless indoor positioning system that utilize location determination algorithms based on proximity, trilateration, and scene analysis. These designs are also compared over two different building sizes, which are medium and large. The design model and performance analysis data were based on our actual implementation of the hardware and software system for a BLE wireless indoor positioning system. Specifically, the received signal strength indication data were collected from our prototype reference nodes. The findings from our study indicated that a proximity-based system can only provide fair location accuracy performance (average error distance of 5 m to 7 m) making it unsuitable for applications that require high accuracy. For medium location accuracy performance (average error distance of 3 m to 5 m), the trilateration-based system can achieve the highest efficiency in terms of number of installed reference nodes over the accuracy. The trilateration-based system can reduce the number of installed reference nodes by 154% to achieve the same level of accuracy as the scene analysis-based system. For good location accuracy performance (average error distance ≤ 3 m), the scene analysis-based system yields the highest scalability performance in terms of installed reference nodes. The scene analysis-based system can reduce the number of reference nodes by 40% and 113% to achieve the same accuracy performance when compared with trilateration and proximity-based systems, respectively. Finally, the validation results from the actual installation of Bluetooth-based indoor positioning systems confirmed that our proposed framework can help the system designers to achieve the required performance goal. 1. Introduction The successful utilization of wireless indoor positioning systems (IPSs) has been attested in smart manufacturing or Industry 4.0 in recent years [1]. The development and implementation of many other interesting indoor location-based applications, such as in healthcare, building management, and disaster preparedness, are expected to increase the global IPS market size significantly from USD 6.1 billion in 2020 to USD 17.0 billion by 2025 [2]. Indoor localization technologies based on Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), ZigBee, Ultra-WideBand (UWB), Visible Light Communication (VLC), and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are examples of wireless IPSs that exploit wireless communication technologies to solve the indoor localization infrastructure problem. These technologies were introduced in response to the lack of reference signals, which are an essential part of the positioning infrastructure, available from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The main reason for this shortcoming is that the GNSS signal cannot penetrate well inside buildings [3]. Many researchers have worked on improving the IPSs using various location determination algorithms to achieve the goal of greater location accuracy [4, 5]. However, designing an IPS infrastructure that considers the accuracy performance requirements as a major design objective can represent another approach to be investigated by researchers. There are two basic approaches that have been used to design wireless IPSs: the existing infrastructure design approach and the new installation design approach [3]. The first approach involves using the existing wireless network infrastructure to estimate a target location. The advantage of this approach is that it eliminates expense and the need to develop a special network infrastructure. This results in a less time-consuming design, which is the first process for deploying IPSs [5]. Examples of existing researches that focus on the development of IPSs using the existing infrastructure design approach are in [6, 7]. The authors of [6] presented the development of IPSs based on WLAN fingerprinting, which can solve the problem of missing access points (APs) inside AP-dense shopping malls. The authors exploited the existing IEEE 802.11 b standard WLAN infrastructure in a large venue, which had 1,734 APs installed. In another study, the authors of [7] proposed an indoor positioning solution based on the available WLAN infrastructure in public indoor spaces such as airports. Their system aimed to provide a standalone indoor positioning service that operated with 220 different service set identifiers (SSIDs) emitted from APs. However, this type of design approach requires an intelligent positioning algorithm in order to compensate for the lack of sufficient positioning infrastructure. More precisely, the existing infrastructure cannot achieve an acceptable radio signal requirement for the IPSs, such as minimum received signal strength (RSS) from the APs. The main reason why the existing wireless communication infrastructure such as WLAN cannot support the location determination performance goal for the IPSs is that it was originally designed only for data communication purpose. In other words, the network was designed to satisfy the data rate or the user’s capacity requirements with minimum interference among APs [3]. Therefore, adjusting the number of existing APs or relocating them to improve the IPS’s performance can lead to major changes or degradations in the network performance of existing telecommunications networks, such as by reducing the quality of service, capacity, and coverage [4]. For the second design approach, a new installation design can be developed to improve location determination performance, and the system designer could have more flexible control over both communication and positioning systems. For instance, the density of wireless APs used as communication or reference nodes (RNs) for positioning can be efficiently determined by applying various optimal node placement designs for the IPSs [3]. In [8], the aim of the indoor positioning applications was to determine whether the object was inside or outside a room; therefore, the RNs could be deployed with low density. In related literature, many IPSs have been designed to accommodate new hardware installation for their positioning infrastructure. The authors of [9] proposed an indoor positioning system based on Bluetooth technology. A total of 56 Bluetooth nodes were installed inside a shopping mall to capture a variety of relevant metrics related to consumer behavior, such as shopping duration per visit. In [10], the authors presented an optimizing sensor placement approach for indoor localization in an ambient assisted-living environment called Smart-Condo. Their work focused on how to achieve the maximum coverage of the sensing field in the living room through optimal sensor placement. The goal of their IPS was to track the location and movement of individuals within their living spaces, such as if the presence in the bathroom correlated to personal hygiene activities. These examples of design approaches take advantage of new infrastructure installation that allows more efficiency and flexibility in the delivery of location-based services. In the recent literature, works related to the IPS design problem that concentrate on RN placement problems either focus on enhancing the efficiency of the system design approach or investigate the impacts of RN placement [11–15]. These existing works propose different system design solutions to meet their required localization goals. In terms of system design, a number of positioning performance metrics have been taken into account, such as improving system robustness [11], maximizing radio signal coverage [12], reducing the effect of noise and interference [13], minimizing estimating error [14], and addressing similar location fingerprint information [15]. However, a design objective in terms of what the required number of RNs should be and their optimum locations for achieving a target positioning performance goal under different indoor positioning algorithms has not yet been investigated in the existing works. Based on these knowledge gaps, how to balance a sufficient number of installed RNs and achieve location accuracy to meet the required performance goals for different indoor positioning applications is still an open research problem in the current literature. Due to the number of technology, technique, and algorithm combinations for IPSs, seeking to provide the exact design analysis for the stated problem is no trivial matter. Therefore, this work selects the example of an indoor positioning system based on Bluetooth Low Energy [16] technology since we have already developed and deployed a prototype of this system in our own research center. This wireless technology is intended for short-range wireless transmission with low energy consumption and low cost [16, 17]. However, our design approach is a framework that could be applicable to other IPSs as well. The results of our design analysis are in the form of an approximation chart which can be considered as the recommended baseline for finding performance design points. The system designer can use the chart to strike a balance between accuracy, the number of RNs, the fingerprint granularity, suitable application, and the dimensions of the service area. The design analysis in this work is based on three different groups of indoor positioning algorithms, which are proximity, trilateration, and scene analysis. Note that the proposed Robust-Maximum Summation of Max RSSI (R-MSMR) developed previously [11] is used in this work to design the wireless IPS infrastructure. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we explain our prototype Bluetooth Low Energy-based indoor positioning system used in this work. Then in Section 3, we describe our proposed framework for creating a recommended baseline for designing IPSs. Section 4 details the experimental environment and the setup parameters used in this work, while the experimental results are reported and discussed in Section 5. The developed design baseline is validated with the actual implementation of an indoor positioning system in our research facility. Finally, the conclusion and discussion of our proposed framework and future work are presented in Section 6. 2. Indoor Positioning Using Bluetooth Low Energy Bluetooth technology has been primarily developed for short-range wireless transmission with low power consumption and low cost [16, 17]. Then starting with the release of the Bluetooth 4.0 specification [17] in 2010, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an attractive wireless technology that can be applied to indoor positioning systems. Over the subsequent years, BLE has been applied for location-based services, ranging from proximity detection to positioning in real-time location system (RTLS) [18]. Moreover, the BLE technology is readily available on almost all portable devices such as smartphones and electronic development kits [4]. The widespread adoption of BLE technology such as Bluetooth beacons [19] allows end users to enjoy easy access to many important features of IPSs such as navigation and tracking services. Thus, this current research adopts the BLE technology and takes the new installation design approach to investigate how the systematic design of an IPS can be applied to achieve a required performance objective for different indoor location-based applications. Figure 1 illustrates the system architecture of our BLE-based indoor positioning system. In this work, the developed IPS is a real-time location system in which Bluetooth tags (attached to objects or held by users) are tracked for their location inside an area with Bluetooth locators. Note that the Bluetooth tag is equivalent to the target node, while the Bluetooth locator is referred to as the reference node (RN) in this work. The four main components of our system consist of target nodes, reference nodes (RNs), a communication network, and a processing unit. The first component is the target node, such as a BLE tag. It is an active RFID card that can continuously broadcast a BLE’s beacon signal as a BLE message. The BLE messages (with their tag ID) or beacons are typically transmitted periodically over a short duration. The interval between beacon transmissions can be set anywhere between 100 milliseconds and up to five seconds. Figure 2(a) illustrates a target node used in this work. It is a common off-the-shelf (COTS) Bluetooth beacon card from Minew Tech [20]. The dimensions of the device are approximately 90 mm × 60 mm × 4 mm. We can configure this BLE tag’s beacon broadcast interval and transmit power via any mobile phone with a Bluetooth interface. The BLE tag is based on an nRF52 series chipset from Nordic Semiconductor [21]. Note that the broadcasting interval of the BLE tag was set to one second in our system. The transmit power and typical receiver sensitivity for the BLE tag (target node) were set to +0 dBm and −93 dBm, respectively. With these settings and specifications, the range of these BLE transceivers for indoor use with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) is approximately 25 meters based on our experiment.

 Evaluation of reliability is very important entity for the design and operation of systems. The safety, dependability, availability, Mean Time To Failure (MTTF), Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) and life cycle of the designed system can be judged from this reliability evaluation. For simple systems, the evaluation is straightforward. However, for complex systems, an algorithmic procedure is required. This paper presents an algorithmic procedure based on information matrices derived from graph theoretic approach. A simulation tool is developed that applies the algorithm to evaluate the reliability of complex systems.

 The increasing availability of sensor devices has resulted in important volumes of sensor data, which has raised the issue of making these data fully discoverable andinterpretable by applications and end-users. The idea of OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) has addressed this issue by proposing a set of standards to enable accessibility ofsensor data over the Web. Similarly, there is a growing interest in volunteered geographic information (VGI). Considering that several researchers have highlighted the potential ofthis new type of information as a complement to existing, "traditional" data, it becomes important to develop frameworks to support the integration of VGI from several sourcesand with other types of data. In this paper, we make a first step in this direction by proposing a framework for the semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI. Afterhaving performed an investigation of the types of VGI applications, we have developed a conceptual model of VGI aligned with relevant ISO standards for describing geospatialfeatures. The purpose of this model is to support the generation of common descriptions for VGI applications, which will act as interfaces to higher-level services, such as discoveryand reasoning services, in order to be exploited in conjunction with sensor data by client applications. This process is described through architecture for semantic interoperability ofsensor data and VGI that we have developed and that we intend to use to set guidelines for future research on integration of VGI in sensor data cyberinfrastructures. We illustrate the possibilities created by the proposed framework with a description of the various servicesand interfaces required to implement the framework.

[Show full abstract]  lim- ited commercial deployments has been that budgetary and technical constraints have actually kept these fields sepa- rate and distinct. One manifestation of this separation is in the choice of sensors used to build systems in each do- main. A truly cross-disciplinary project has to incorporate sensors of much greater heterogeneity than has occurred heretofore. The way in which sensors are deployed results in spatial seams that can act as obstacles to the provision of services across different areas. This paper takes an archi- tectural approach to handling events from different tracking systems and maintaining a consistent spatial model of peo- ple and objects. The principal distinguishing feature is the automatic derivation of dataflow network of distributed sen- sors, dynamically and at run-time, based on requirements expressed by clients.

  This paper proposes a new application framework to adopt mobile augmented reality in indoor localization and navigation. We observe that there are two constraints in existing positioning systems. First, the signal drifting problem may mistake the positioning results but most of positioning systems do not adopt user feedback information to help correct these positioning errors. Second, traditional ... [Show full abstract]  positioning systems usually consider a two-dimensional environment but an indoor building should be treated as a three-dimensional environment. To release the above constraints, our framework allows users to interact with the positioning system by the multi-touch screen and IMU sensors equipped in the mobile devices. In particular, the multi-touch screen allows users to identify their requirements while the IMU sensors will feedback users' moving behaviors such as their moving directions to help correct positioning errors. Besides, with the cameras equipped in the mobile devices, we can realize the mobile augmented reality to help navigate users in a more complex indoor environment and provide more interactive location-based service. A prototype system is also developed to verify the practicability of our application framework.

We evaluated the system from a technical point of view and achieved a precision ...

We further evaluated the system from the user's point of view based on the feedback from 6 hearing-impaired HI users (4 men, 2 women, age 27-60).We compared our head-gesture-based control to existing HI user interfaces: HI-integrated buttons and HI remote control. We found that the benefit of the different HI interaction solutions depends on the user's current situations and that all participating HI users would appreciate head gesture control as an additional, complementing user interface.

This paper addresses the design and implementation of a mobile, context-aware human resource scheduling application that is distributed over several mobile devices using wireless technologies. Each instance of the application uses the concept of a trail, which is a collection of locations together with associated information. Activities to be performed by users are aggregated by the application and dispatched to users' trails based on the current context. This concept creates a collaborative environment that enables efficient resource scheduling across multiple users, providing location-based services using ubiquitous technologies.

In this paper, we illustrate our approach for proactive intelligent assistance and we describe our architecture based on three principal layers. These layers are designed in order to build applications which can increase the welfare of the user situated in intelligent environment.

 July 2013    
 Anbarasi A. 
  M. Ishwarya 
  A smart home is an application of ubiquitous computing in which the home environment is monitored by ambient intelligence to provide context-aware services and facilitate remote home control. It describes collective information about sensors, multimedia devices, communication protocols, and systems, which are widely used in smart home implementation. This paper also presents a concrete guideline ... [Show full abstract]  for future researchers to follow in developing a practical and sustainable smart home. Smart home system divides assigns various home network tasks to appropriate components. It can integrate physical sensing information and control various consumer home devices. This paper presents a methodology for the evaluation of wireless smart homes and home automation network in indoor scenarios.

  Indoor navigation plays a central role for the safety of firefighters. The circumstances in which a firefighting intervention occurs represent a rather complex challenge for the design of supporting technology. In this paper, we present the results of our work designing an ad hoc ubicomp infrastructure to support navigation of firefighters working in structure fires inside the zone of danger. We ... [Show full abstract]  take a wider approach, complementing the technical questions with the development of effective navigation practices based on technology available today. We provide an overview of the complete design process, from the theoretical and empirical underpinnings to the construction and evaluation of three iterations of the platform. We report the results of our evaluation and the implications and tensions uncovered in this process, and we discuss the challenges and implications of it for the design of ubicomp for firefighters.

 Computational Optimization  
 (CO)  
   
 Image   

 Kraków, Poland, 14-17 September, 2025   
    
 Many real world problems arising in engineering, economics, medicine and other domains can be formulated as optimization tasks. These problems are frequently characterized by non-convex, non-differentiable, discontinuous, noisy or dynamic objective functions and constraints which ask for adequate computational methods.  
 The aim of this Thematic Session is to stimulate the communication between researchers working on different fields of optimization and practitioners who need reliable and efficient computational optimization methods.  
 We invite original contributions related to both theoretical and practical aspects of optimization methods.  
   
 Topics  
 The list of topics includes, but is not limited to:  
 combinatorial and continuous global optimization 
  unconstrained and constrained optimization 
  multiobjective and robust optimization 
  optimization in dynamic and/or noisy environments 
  optimization on graphs 
  large-scale optimization, in parallel and distributed computational environments 
  meta-heuristics for optimization, nature-inspired approaches and any other derivative-free methods 
  exact/heuristic hybrid methods, involving natural computing techniques and other global and local optimization methods 
  numerical and heuristic methods for modeling 
  The applications of interest are included in the list below, but are not limited to:  
 classical operational research problems (knapsack, traveling salesman, etc) 
  computational biology and distance geometry 
  data mining and knowledge discovery 
  human motion simulations; crowd simulations 
  industrial applications 
  optimization in statistics, econometrics, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering 
  environment modeling and optimization 
  In the past, a number of Best Paper awards was granted to participants of this Thematic Session Best Paper Award – past winners  .

  Symposium: June 11-13, 2025 
  Final versions due: July 4, 2025 
  Aims and scope  
 WG is mainly concerned with efficient algorithms of various types (e.g., sequential, parallel, distributed, randomized, parameterized) for problems on graphs and networks. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. Submitted papers should describe original results in any aspects of graph theory related to computer science, including but not restricted to:  
 design and analysis of sequential, parallel, randomized, parameterized algorithms 
  distributed graph and network algorithms 
  structural graph theory with algorithmic or complexity applications 
  computational complexity of graph and network problems 
  graph grammars, graph rewriting systems and graph modeling

  support of the above concepts by suitable implementations and applications. 
  ## Awards  
 WG 2025 will offer awards for the best paper and the best student paper. The awards will be decided by the program committee. The committee can decide to split the awards over multiple papers, or not to offer an award. Papers eligible for the best student paper can have non-student co-authors, but the main work in a paper that is a candidate for the best student paper award must be done by co-authors that were students at the time of submission, and the award can be received only by such co-authors. It must be indicated at the time of submission whether a paper is a candidate for this award.

 Simulations of Flow and Transport: Modeling, Algorithms and Computation – SOFTMAC  
 Web Address:  Coming soon.   
 Contact:  Shuyu Sun  , King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia, email    
 Description:  Modeling of flow and transport is an essential component of many scientific and engineering applications, with increased interests in recent years. Application areas vary widely, and include groundwater contamination, carbon sequestration, air pollution, petroleum exploration and recovery, weather prediction, drug delivery, material design, chemical separation processes, biological processes, and many others. However, accurate mathematical and numerical simulation of flow and transport remains a challenging topic from many aspects of physical modeling, numerical analysis and scientific computation. Mathematical models are usually expressed via nonlinear systems of partial differential equations, with possibly rough and discontinuous coefficients, whose solutions are often singular and discontinuous. An important step of a numerical solution procedure is to apply advanced discretization methods (e.g. finite elements, finite volumes, and finite differences) to the governing equations. Local mass conservation and compatibility of numerical schemes are often necessary to obtain physical meaningful solutions. Another important solution step is the design of fast and accurate solvers for the large-scale linear and nonlinear algebraic equation systems that result from discretization. Solution techniques of interest include multiscale algorithms, mesh adaptation, parallel algorithms and implementation, efficient splitting or decomposition schemes, and others.  
  The international workshop on “Simulations of Flow and Transport: Modeling, Algorithms and Computation” (SOFTMAC) has been held 13 years since 2011 within the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS). The aim of this symposium is to bring together researchers in the aforementioned field to highlight the current developments both in theory and methods, to exchange the latest research ideas, and to promote further collaborations in the community. We invite original research articles describing the recent advances in mathematical modeling, computer simulation, numerical analysis, and other computational aspects of flow and transport phenomena of flow and transport.  
  Potential topics include, but are not limited to: advanced numerical methods for the simulation of subsurface and surface flow and transport, and associated aspects such as discretization, gridding, upscaling, multiscale algorithms, optimization, data assimilation, uncertainty assessment, and high performance parallel and grid computing; 
  spatial discretization schemes based on advanced finite element, finite volume, and finite different methods; schemes that preserve local mass conservation (such as mixed finite element methods and discontinuous Galerkin methods) are of particular interest; 
  decomposition methods for improved efficiency and accuracy in treating flow and transport problems; decomposition methods for nonlinear differential equations and dynamical systems arising in flow and transport; temporal discretization schemes for flow and transport; 
  a-priori and a-posteriori error estimates in discretizations and decompositions; numerical convergence study; adaptive algorithms and implementation; 
  modeling and simulation of single-phase and multi-phase flow in porous media or in free space, and its applications to earth sciences and engineering; 
  modeling and simulation of subsurface and surface transport and geochemistry, and its application to environmental sciences and engineering; 
  computational thermodynamics of fluids, especially hydrocarbon and other oil reservoir fluids, and its interaction with flow and transport; 
  (8) computational modeling of flow and transport in other fields, such as geological flow/transport in crust and mantle, material flow in supply chain networks, separation processes in chemical engineering, information flow, biotransport, and intracellular protein trafficking, will also be considered.

 Solving Problems with Uncertainty – SPU  
 Web Address:  https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/events/solving-problems-with-uncertainty/    
 Contact:  Vassil Alexandrov  STFC Hartree Centre, United Kingdom, email    
 Description:  Problems with uncertainty need to be tackled in an increasing variety of areas, from physics, chemistry, engineering, computational biology and environmental sciences to decision making in economics and social sciences. Uncertainty is unavoidable in almost all systems analysis, risk analysis, decision making and modelling and simulation. How uncertainty is handled and quantified shapes the integrity of the analysis, and the correctness and credibility of the solution and the results is especially important when tackling complex systems.  
  With exascale computing now being a reality, and the advances of big data analytics and scalable AI, larger and larger problems – often requiring hybrid approaches – have to be solved in a systematic way at scale. The problem of solving such problems with uncertainties and quantifying the uncertainties becomes even more important, especially in the case of complex systems, due to the variety and scale of uncertainties in such problems.  
  The focus of the workshop will be on methods and algorithms for solving problems with uncertainties, stochastic methods and algorithms for solving problems with uncertainties, methods and algorithms for quantifying uncertainties such as dealing with data input and missing data, sensitivity analysis (local and global), dealing with model inadequacy, model validation and averaging, software fault-tolerance and resilience and more.

 The International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG)  

 WG 2025  , the 51st WG conference, will take place in Otzenhausen, Germany.  
  
 Since 1975, WG conferences aim to connect theory and applications by demonstrating how graph-theoretic concepts can be applied in various areas of computer science. As such WG is mainly concerned with efficient algorithms of various types (e.g. sequential, parallel, distributed, randomized, parameterized) for problems on graphs and networks. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. Work presented at WG describes original results in any aspects of graph theory related to computer science, including but not restricted to:  
 design and analysis of sequential, parallel, randomized, parameterized algorithms 
  distributed graph and network algorithms 
  structural graph theory with algorithmic or complexity applications 
  computational complexity of graph and network problems 
  graph grammars, graph rewriting systems and graph modeling 
  graph drawing and layouts 
  computational geometry 
  computational biology 
  graph mining 
  random graphs and models of the web and scale-free networks 
  support of the above concepts by suitable implementations and applications.

   About the Conference  
 The 2024 IEEE/WIC International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT'24) provides a premier international forum to bring together researchers and practitioners from diverse fields for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences on Web intelligence and intelligent agent technology research and applications. Academia, professionals and industry people can exchange their ideas, findings and strategies in deepening the understanding of all Web's entities, phenomena, and developments in utilizing the power of human brains and man-made networks to create a better world and intelligent societies. More specifically, the fields of how artificial intelligence is impacting the Web of People, the Web of Data, the Web of Things, the Web of Trust, the Web of Agents, the Web in industry, society, health, and smart living, the Web of Everything, and emerging AIGC in WI-IAT.   
  
 The first international conference of Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT'01) was held in Maebashi Japan, 2001. Then, it followed by WI-IAT'03 in Halifax, Canada, WI-IAT'04 in Beijing, China, WI-IAT'05 in Compiegne, France, WI- IAT '06 in Hong Kong, WI-IAT'07 in Silicon Valley, USA, WI-IAT'08 in Sydney, Australia, WI-IAT'09 in Milano Italy, WI-IAT'10 in Toronto, Canada, WI-IAT'11 in Lyon, France, WI-IAT'12 in Macau, China, WI-IAT'13 in Atlanta, USA, WI-IAT'14 in Warsaw, Poland, and WI-IAT'15 in Singapore. The goal of WI-IAT conferences is to provide a global forum for scientists, engineers and educators to present the latest WI-IAT technologies discuss how to develop future intelligent systems for complex applications. After these years, in 2016, WI-IAT conferences have been merged as one brand (WI'16 in Omaha, USA, WI'17 in Leipzig, Germany, WI'18 in Santiago de Chile, and WI'19 in Thessaloniki, Greece) by redefining and vitalizing the WI aims and topics. In recognition of the strong connection of Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology, the classic brand of WI-IAT was resumed in 2020. After the great successful online WI-IAT'20, hybrid WI-IAT'21, WI-IAT'22, and WI-IAT'23, WI-IAT'24 will be held in Bangkok, Thailand, and once again, in the hybrid mode. Therefore, the theme of WI-IAT '24 will be: “Web Intelligence = AI in the Connected World”.   
  
 Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT) aims to achieve a multi-disciplinary balance between research advances in theories and methods usually associated with collective intelligence, data science, human-centric computing, knowledge management, network science, autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. It is committed to addressing research that both deepen the understanding of computational, logical, cognitive, physical, and social foundations of the future Web, and enable the development and application of intelligent technologies. WI-IAT'24 provides a premier forum and features high-quality, original research papers and real-world applications in all theoretical and technology areas that make up the field of Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology. WI-IAT'24 welcomes research, and application as well as Workshop and Special-Session proposals and papers. WI-IAT'24 in Bangkok (Thailand) is officially sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Intelligent Informatics (TCII) and Web Intelligence Consortium (WIC).
