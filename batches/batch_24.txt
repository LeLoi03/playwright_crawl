 Description  
 This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 18th International Joint Conference on Theoretical Computer Science-Frontier of Algorithmic Wisdom (IJTCS-FAW 2024), consisting of the 18th International Conference on Frontier of Algorithmic Wisdom (FAW) and the 5th International Joint Conference on Theoretical Computer Science (IJTCS), held in Hong Kong, SAR, China, during July 29-31, 2024.  
  FAW started as the Frontiers of Algorithmic Workshop in 2007 at Lanzhou, China, and was held annually from 2007 to 2021 and published archival proceedings. IJTCS, the International joint theoretical Computer Science Conference, started in 2020, aimed to bring in presentations covering active topics in selected tracks in theoretical computer science.  
  To accommodate the diversified new research directions in theoretical computer science, FAW and IJTCS joined their forces together to organize an event for information exchange of new findings and work of enduring value in the field.  
 The 20 full papers and 3 short papers included in this book were carefully reviewed and selected from 43 submissions. They focused tracks on algorithms, blockchain theory, computational economics and algorithmic game theory.

 General Information FASE is concerned with the foundations on which software engineering is built. Submissions should make novel contributions to making software engineering a more mature and soundly-based discipline. Contributions should be supported by appropriate arguments and validation. Contributions that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. We welcome contributions to all such fundamental approaches, including: applications of AI to software engineering, including search-based, learning-based approaches, and advances in code generation and program synthesis, automated testing and debugging, software documentation and program understanding, intelligent code review and refactoring, DevOps and AIOps, and applications of large language models (LLMs). software engineering foundations for AI-based systems, for example with focus on: explainability, transparency and trust, data management, testing and verification, lifecycle management, system architecture; software quality and testing: validation and verification of functional and non-functional software properties ( including security and data privacy) using techniques such as theorem proving, model checking, testing, analysis, simulation, refinement methods, metrics or visualization techniques; software engineering as an engineering discipline, including its interaction with and impact on society and economics; ethical and responsible software engineering: prioritizing fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI and software systems while addressing societal concerns like inequality and bias; requirements engineering: capture, consistency, and change management of software requirements, natural language processing for requirement elicitation; software architectures: description and analysis of the architecture, e.g., SOA, microservice architectures, cloud-native architectures, event-driven architectures, model-driven architectures, or software product lines; specification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems: (self-)adaptive, autonomous, collaborative, intelligent, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, cyber-physical, data-centric, service-oriented applications, multi-agent systems, safety-critical, real-time, blockchain-based, mixed-reality systems, human-in-the-loop systems or digital twins; model-driven engineering: model transformation, meta-modelling, design and semantics of domain-specific languages, consistency and synchronization of models, generative architectures, low-code and no-code development; software processes: support for iterative, agile, and open source development; software evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering, configuration management and architectural change, mining software repositories.

 The IEEE International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines is the original and premier forum for presenting and discussing new research related to computing that exploits the unique features and capabilities of FPGAs and other reconfigurable hardware. Over the past two decades, FCCM has been the place to present papers on architectures, tools, and programming models for field-programmable custom computing machines as well as applications that use such systems. This year FCCM seeks to embrace its role as the venue where “firsts” are presented by encouraging submissions describing new forward thinking research on emerging technologies with in-field reconfiguration capabilities for the upcoming post Moore’s Law era. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  

 Custom Computing and Reconfigurable Architectures  :  
 Heterogeneous and mixed signal digital/analog field customizable accelerators 
  Neuromorphic emulation and accelerators 
  Memory centric computing architectures 
  Overlays, coarse grained reconfigurable architectures 
  Clusters, data centers, and large systems 
  IoT and Embedded SoC, MPSoC architectures with reconfigurable devices 
  Security enhancements for reconfigurable computing 
  Customizable soft processor systems 
  Abstractions, Programming Models, and Tools:   
 Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for FPGA design 
  Domain-specific languages, frameworks, and open-source hw/sw synthesis/compilation tools 
  Design tools, instrumentation, debug for designer productivity 
  High-level synthesis 
  Software-defined-systems (e.g. radio, networks, frameworks for new domains) 
  CAD tools, abstractions, and languages for mixed analog/digital fabrics 
  Run Time Reconfiguration:   
 Run-time management and scheduling of reconfigurable hardware 
  System resilience/fault tolerance for reconfigurable hardware 
  Evolvable, adaptable, approximate, or autonomous reconfigurable computing systems 
  Security assessment and enhancement of run-time reconfiguration 
  Applications

 The IEEE International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines is the original and premier forum for presenting and discussing new research related to computing that exploits the unique features and capabilities of FPGAs and other reconfigurable hardware. Over the past two decades, FCCM has been the place to present papers on architectures, tools, and programming models for field-programmable custom computing machines as well as applications that use such systems. This year FCCM seeks to embrace its role as the venue where “firsts” are presented by encouraging submissions describing new forward thinking research on emerging technologies with in-field reconfiguration capabilities for the upcoming post Moore’s Law era. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  

 Custom Computing and Reconfigurable Architectures  :  
 Heterogeneous and mixed signal digital/analog field customizable accelerators 
  Neuromorphic emulation and accelerators 
  Memory centric computing architectures 
  Overlays, coarse grained reconfigurable architectures

 Workshop on Mixed Analog-Digital Configurable Adaptable Processing (MADCAP)  Held during FCCM 2025   
 Mixed analog-digital Processing-in-Memory (PIM) or Computing-in-Memory (CIM) technologies offer the potential to push GEMM efficiencies to the order of 1000 TOPs/Watt for small-scale matrix multiplication kernels. However, one of their primary barriers to widespread adoption is the resultant efficiency loss caused by their integration with conventional processors and other coprocessors.  
 One approach to solve this is to consider tight integration of such technologies into FPGA or FPGA-like System-on-Chip, which PIM/CIM arrays would efficiently comprise one facet of a heterogeneous collection of accelerator technologies, allowing for workload optimization at runtime. To achieve this, the MAPCAP workshop will bring together the FCCM and VLSI communities in a full-day workshop, held on the Sunday prior to FCCM 2025, to collaborate and share ideas.  
 This workshop will include several special sessions, whose topics will be driven by proposals solicited from both communities, with each special session showcasing a series of invited and contributed peer-reviewed papers.  
 Call for Special Sessions  
 We invite proposals for special sessions at MADCAP 2025. Special sessions will nominally be allocated 1.5 to 2 hours. Speakers and presenters in the special session have the opportunity to have a short paper (up to 6 pages, excluding references) or a 1-page extended abstract (including references) accepted for inclusion in the FCCM proceedings. All submissions will undergo review and require TPC recommendation before publication in the official conference proceedings.  
  
  Proposals should be submitted as a single PDF file one to two pages in length via email to Jason D. Bakos, the 2025 FCCM Workshops and Tutorials Chair, via e-mail to workshops@fccm.org. Questions about submissions should be directed to the same email address.

   Conference Overview  Attending FDG 2024  Theme and Vision  Important Dates    

 Conference Overview  
 The International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) invites any-and-all research contributions that advance the study, understanding, and knowledge of digital games. From traditional academic submissions (e.g., full papers and short papers) to interactive playable experiences (e.g., full games or demos), to panel proposals, doctoral consortium applications, and beyond, FDG strives to provide a welcoming home for all types of games scholarship.  
 Games are an inherently interdisciplinary medium, and as such the conference welcomes contributions from within and across any discipline committed to the advancement of knowledge of digital games. Historically the conference receives submissions from fields such as computer science and engineering, humanities and social sciences, arts and design, as well as mathematics and natural sciences, though this list is by no means exhaustive. The greater the diversity of perspectives represented at the conference, the further we can push the boundaries of the field.  
 Traditionally papers submitted and accepted for presentation at the conference are published in the ACM Digital Library. Paper submissions―both short and long―and game and demo submissions will go through a double anonymous peer review process, and therefore should be anonymized and written in the ACM SIGCONF format. Word and LaTeX templates of this format can be accessed here: ACM Primary Template  . Panel proposals, workshop proposals, competition proposals, Doctoral Consortium applications, and all other contributions will be single anonymous. All contributions should be submitted via the FDG 2024 EasyChair  .  
 When making a submission, EasyChair will ask you to select a Track. A list of this year’s conference’s tracks and brief descriptions of each can be found below. Please select the track that you feel best represents the nature of your work and is the community of scholars that you would most like to review it. If none of the tracks are a perfect fit, please do not be deterred! Either select the track that you believe is the best fit or, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email the Program Co-Chairs at katta.spiel@tuwien.ac.at  and bsamuel@cs.uno.edu  with any questions you may have. We’ll do our best to ensure every submission finds its proper home and is reviewed by members of the games community best equipped to critique it fairly.  
 We are excited to review your work! Together, we’ll make FDG24 the best one yet!  
  
   FDG 2024 is made possible by the support of  

  FDG 2024 is held in cooperation with ACM  and the following:

 Theme and Vision  
 The special theme for this year’s conference is “ Playing Well, Together   ” which recognizes the unifying power of games and game playing. Example work that falls under this year’s theme might include, but is by no means limited to, research on connecting disparate players, or work that is particularly interdisciplinary or otherwise boundary crossing, work that inspires or enables congenial collaborations. Diversity and inclusion in game playing and production are important to FDG, and we welcome papers which explore these themes, considered broadly. Games are an international cultural phenomenon, and hence we hope this theme will attract papers which explore how games are made, appreciated, and create culture across the globe.  
 Although all work related to digital games is welcome, special consideration will be given to submissions that relate in some way to this year’s theme. Themes are always open to interpretation, of course; if you believe your work falls under the purview of this year’s theme, please mark your work as such on EasyChair prior to submitting it.  
 Important Dates  
 All submissions (other than workshop/panel/competition proposals) are to be made on the FDG 2024 EasyChair  . All deadlines are at 11:59pm (23:59) on the date specified, in Anywhere on Earth (AoE). For timezone conversions, use the Time.is AoE page  .

   Conference Overview  Attending FDG 2024  Theme and Vision  Important Dates    

 Conference Overview  
 The International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) invites any-and-all research contributions that advance the study, understanding, and knowledge of digital games. From traditional academic submissions (e.g., full papers and short papers) to interactive playable experiences (e.g., full games or demos), to panel proposals, doctoral consortium applications, and beyond, FDG strives to provide a welcoming home for all types of games scholarship.  
 Games are an inherently interdisciplinary medium, and as such the conference welcomes contributions from within and across any discipline committed to the advancement of knowledge of digital games. Historically the conference receives submissions from fields such as computer science and engineering, humanities and social sciences, arts and design, as well as mathematics and natural sciences, though this list is by no means exhaustive. The greater the diversity of perspectives represented at the conference, the further we can push the boundaries of the field.  
 Traditionally papers submitted and accepted for presentation at the conference are published in the ACM Digital Library. Paper submissions―both short and long―and game and demo submissions will go through a double anonymous peer review process, and therefore should be anonymized and written in the ACM SIGCONF format. Word and LaTeX templates of this format can be accessed here: ACM Primary Template  . Panel proposals, workshop proposals, competition proposals, Doctoral Consortium applications, and all other contributions will be single anonymous. All contributions should be submitted via the FDG 2024 EasyChair  .  
 When making a submission, EasyChair will ask you to select a Track. A list of this year’s conference’s tracks and brief descriptions of each can be found below. Please select the track that you feel best represents the nature of your work and is the community of scholars that you would most like to review it. If none of the tracks are a perfect fit, please do not be deterred! Either select the track that you believe is the best fit or, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email the Program Co-Chairs at katta.spiel@tuwien.ac.at  and bsamuel@cs.uno.edu  with any questions you may have. We’ll do our best to ensure every submission finds its proper home and is reviewed by members of the games community best equipped to critique it fairly.  
 We are excited to review your work! Together, we’ll make FDG24 the best one yet!  
  
   FDG 2024 is made possible by the support of  

  FDG 2024 is held in cooperation with ACM  and the following:

 Theme and Vision  
 The special theme for this year’s conference is “ Playing Well, Together   ” which recognizes the unifying power of games and game playing. Example work that falls under this year’s theme might include, but is by no means limited to, research on connecting disparate players, or work that is particularly interdisciplinary or otherwise boundary crossing, work that inspires or enables congenial collaborations. Diversity and inclusion in game playing and production are important to FDG, and we welcome papers which explore these themes, considered broadly. Games are an international cultural phenomenon, and hence we hope this theme will attract papers which explore how games are made, appreciated, and create culture across the globe.  
 Although all work related to digital games is welcome, special consideration will be given to submissions that relate in some way to this year’s theme. Themes are always open to interpretation, of course; if you believe your work falls under the purview of this year’s theme, please mark your work as such on EasyChair prior to submitting it.  
 Important Dates  
 All submissions (other than workshop/panel/competition proposals) are to be made on the FDG 2024 EasyChair  . All deadlines are at 11:59pm (23:59) on the date specified, in Anywhere on Earth (AoE). For timezone conversions, use the Time.is AoE page  .

 Theme:  
 FDG 2025 will have the theme „Accessible Worlds, United Through Play.“ This theme underscores the vital role of gaming in fostering inclusive communities, strengthening work of diverse groups, and making games and gaming accessible for all. Works addressing this theme could look at the creation of accessible gaming environments, enhancing connectivity among varied gaming communities, and promoting equitable, interdisciplinary and sustainable collaboration in game development, game design, and game studies. The conference theme extends to diversity, equity and inclusivity in both the gaming experience and its creation, and we encourage papers that investigate these aspects in broad terms. We welcome all contributions related to digital games and play, but particular emphasis will be placed on those that align with this year’s theme. Interpretations of the theme are flexible; if you feel your work resonates with „Accessible Worlds, United Through Play,“ please indicate this in your submission. We are excited to see how your research contributes to this important area.  
 Paper Submissions:  
 FDG invites authors to submit papers reporting new research. Authors may submit either full papers (typically up to ten pages in length, excluding references and appendices), or short papers (up to six pages, one column or four pages, two columns in length, including references). The length of these submissions should be commensurate with contribution of the paper, in the judgment of reviewers; papers that are significantly longer than recommended page limits without clear justification (e.g., significant use of images) may be desk rejected. Note that reviewers are not required to read material in appendices during the peer-review process; full papers should not exceed 20 pages including appendices. Submitted papers will need to be anonymized by the authors by removing any identifying author and institution information from the submission. Additionally, papers will need to be submitted in the ACM SIGCONF version of the ACM Master Template.  
 This year FDG is also providing the option for “Abstract Only” submissions. Abstract Only submissions should be submitted to the “Abstract” track, regardless of thematic area. Accepted abstracts will not be published in the conference proceedings, but abstract authors will be given an opportunity to give an oral presentation of their work at the conference  
 Submissions are handled using the FDG 2025 EasyChair  . When submitting a paper, authors will be asked to select one of the conference’s tracks. Please select the track that you feel most closely aligns with the topics covered in your submission. Accepted papers will be included in the proceedings under the track they were accepted for.  
 The template for the submissions can be found under the following link ACM Template  . Please use the template with 2 columns for submissions.  
 Please note that for Regular Papers you are required to submit an abstract by October 3rd to register your submission. You then have time until October 10th to submit your full paper. Descriptions of the tracks are below, but if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to your Program Co-Chairs at Sabine Harrer  or Katta Spiel  !

 Review Process  
 The reviewing process used by FDG 2025 is double-anonymized, meaning that the paper authors do not know the identities of the reviewers, and the reviewers do not know the identities of the authors. Papers will receive three (3) reviews, along with a meta-review written by the Track Chair. Authors have the ability to write a one-page response to initial reviewer comments prior to final decisions being made on papers. Authors of accepted papers are expected to make minor revisions to their papers in response to reviewer comments.  
 Track Information  
 Technical Game Development & Novel Game Controllers  
 This track is for research that advances game development practices. This track is suitable for papers on game engines, frameworks, computer graphics techniques, rendering, animation, networking, novel interaction techniques (such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and alternate controllers) and other technical areas. Furthermore, the submission of work focusing on the development of novel hardware interfaces are also welcome. This track focuses on the technological aspects of game development and offers a venue for researchers and developers to share technological advancements of the field. Please consider that papers that focus more on Artificial Intelligence or Player Analytics should be submitted in their respective tracks.  
 Game Design, Studio Practices, and Novel Player Experiences  
 This track focuses on research that furthers the practice of game design and development. Submissions that examine, validate, invalidate, or create game making practices, patterns, mechanics, dynamics or aesthetics are encouraged to submit. Such work includes innovative and alternative methods of design, practical examinations of implementation protocol, socio-cultural exploration and critique of game-making culture, and empirical analysis of game-making processes and more. In short, this track is appropriate for papers that focus on exploring ways for designing and implementing novel interactions between players and games, as well as on understanding the experiences derived from those interactions The focus of this track is scholarly examination of game design and development, as produced through case studies, A/B testing, review of literature, comparative analysis, ethnographic approaches or other such appropriate efforts. This track will accept both qualitative and quantitative experimental studies.  
 Game Analytics and Visualization  
 This track invites authors to submit research related to data science, game analytics, and game data visualization, as well as analyzing player behavior. Techniques such as player modeling, churn analysis, player profiling, business intelligence and performance evaluation or workflow optimization applied to the field of digital games, are all suitable submissions for this track. Submissions spanning across quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method approaches are also encouraged. Novel methodological approaches are also valued in this track. Examples of submissions appropriate for this track include game data visualization; behavioral analysis (or other) game data; advances in methodological approaches that analyze and/or visualize game data; applying or expanding novel statistical methods; machine learning such as deep learning, clustering, or other AI algorithms; game data mining; and novel visualization and analytical methods for game data.  
 Game Artificial Intelligence  
 This track focuses on the many applications of computational and artificial intelligence to the playing, design, development, improvement, and testing of video games. Topics include general game-playing AI, procedural and player-driven content generation, mixed-initiative authoring tools, computational narrative, believable agents, and AI assisted game design. This track focuses on more experimental technically driven aspects of game development, such as developing algorithms capable of automating certain aspects of games, systems that dynamically influence certain aspects of play or tools that actively help developers during the development process.  
 Game Criticism and Analysis  
 This track calls for papers that approach the criticism and analysis of games from humanities-informed perspectives, including but not limited to perspectives rooted in the digital humanities, cultural studies, critical theory, communications, and related fields. Submissions are encouraged from scholars engaging in narrative, visual and software studies approaches to games and games criticism using methodologies such as archival research, hermeneutics, and oral history. This track will also consider critical, theoretical and/or historical analysis of games, and game genres from perspectives such as (but not limited to) postcolonial theory, feminism, historicism, subaltern studies, queer theory, the environmental humanities, and psychoanalysis. Socio-cultural critiques of game-making cultures and game-playing cultures are equally encouraged submissions for this track.  
 Games Beyond Entertainment  
 This track calls for papers showing results on the use of games, gaming, and game design for primary goals that are not entertainment. Topics include serious or transformational games, educational games, games with a purpose, advergames and exergames, gamification and gameful design, game-based learning, informal learning in games, and educational and other 'serious' uses of entertainment games and gaming practices. Authors are encouraged to highlight the importance of the target problem that the game is addressing, and how their design or research findings makes a contribution to the current state of research on games for a purpose. For games in education and training, this includes teaching and assessment methods, tools and techniques, and educational game-related programs.  
 Games Pedagogy  
 This track is concerned with the teaching of games, game development and design, and game-related concepts at all levels of education and training. Topics include design and development of curricula, instructional methods, teaching tools and techniques, assessment methods, learning/instructional activities, collegiate game programs, e-sports and educational program management. For research in gamified and game-based learning, please submit to Games beyond Entertainment track, unless it is work on game-based/gamified learning of game concepts.  
 Lightning Talk Track  
 Scholars who wish to share their work with the FDG community but who do not wish for their work to be published in the conference proceedings should submit to the abstract track. Submissions to this track should be anonymous (that is, any information identifying either the authors or their institutions should be removed), and may be up to five-hundred words on any subject related to digital games. Submitted abstracts will be anonymously peer reviewed, and authors of accepted abstracts will be given the opportunity to give an oral presentation of their work at the conference. Accepted abstracts will not be published in the conference proceedings; this track is intended for scholars coming from disciplines for whom journal publications (or other non-conference publication outlets) are preferred, and having work published in conference proceedings would be problematic for that disciplines preferred methods of publication.  
 Late Breaking Short Papers  
 This track is an amalgam of all regular tracks, focusing on smaller scale studies, work in progress, vision studies and tools/artifacts related to digital game research. Late-breaking papers will be presented as posters at the conference, and included in the official proceedings.  
 Late-breaking papers have a maximum page length of six pages, one column or four pages, two columns  in the ACM Master Template format – including references and appendices.  
 Deadline for paper submission is Thursday, January 16, 2025, AoE  .  
 Games and Demos  
 The games and demo exhibition provides a forum for demonstrations of work best suited to interaction rather than a paper or formal presentation. This track encourages submissions of games in various stages of development, from playable physical mock-ups to full-fledged implementations, as well as technical demos showcasing the latest tools, techniques, and systems created for games by academic or industrial research groups, or other early-stage or late-breaking research not yet ready for formal presentation.  
 Submissions should include a two-page (including references) extended abstract using the ACM SIGCONF version of the ACM Primary Template  , an unedited video illustrating the game or technology, and (if possible) a link to the demo. Games and tech demos will be presented at a dedicated games and tech demo session open to the public.  
 Doctoral Consortium  
 A Doctoral Consortium (DC) will be held at FDG 2025 to enable PhD students to discuss their research with fellow students and professors. While the consortium is designed for senior PhD students who will pursue a career in academia, any PhD student is welcome to apply.  
 The DC is an in-person event to be held at FDG 2025, but efforts will be made to accommodate online attendees if necessary. Subject to the total number of participants, the DC will likely be held in a separate space with participants and selected mentors. The DC event is expected to last for about half of a conference day.  
 Accepted PhD students may be invited to present a poster of their work during the poster exhibition, in addition to attending the DC session. Accepted PhD students will be asked to participate in a round of short talks to solicit and receive feedback from anyone in the audience, and were then paired up with faculty mentors for one-on-one discussions afterwards. The faculty mentors will be selected by the DC-organizers to ensure that paired PhD students can ask questions about 1) the content of their research proposals, 2) navigating the PhD process, and 3) looking for jobs in academia. We - (the organizers) - recommend that you pose these questions in both your application to the DC and if selected to participate, the short talk itself.  
 We solicit applications as a single PDF in the following format:  
 CV and a short cover letter explaining expected benefits from attending the consortium and questions to discuss (general and/or specific to their research) 
  2 to 4 pages about the PhD work (excluding any number of pages for references) in the ACM SIGCONF version of the ACM Primary Template. Submissions should address the goals of the research, the proposed approach, any results, and plans for completing the work. 
  Note that submissions should include the name and university affiliation of the applicant.  
 Workshop Proposals  
 FDG 2025 provides venues to host a series of full-day or half-day workshop sessions, focused on current and emerging game-related topics. Workshops are an opportunity to discuss, present, and demonstrate new technological developments, emerging technologies, specific research topics and game-related topics. They may also be hands-on or studio based. We especially encourage workshops and topics that involve participants from a range of disciplinary backgrounds, towards strengthening interdisciplinarity in games research.  
   
  Workshop proposals should be 2-4 pages, excluding references, in the ACM SIGCONF version of the ACM Primary Template and include: a background section explaining and motivating the workshop, the objectives of the workshop, planned activities, the background of the organizer(s), publication plans (if any), anticipated number of participants, and the means for soliciting and selecting participants. Workshop proposals will not be included in the conference proceedings.  
   
  Workshop can have a maximum length of 3:30 (2x 90min, with 30mins break)

 More detailed information can be found here  .  
 Competition Proposals  
 Competitions provide a venue for the submission of community-driven solutions capable of solving game-related complex problems. FDG welcomes competition proposals, with a maximum length of 2 pages (excluding references) in the ACM SIGCONF version of the ACM Primary Template  . Contents of the proposal should include a description of the competition and the organizers, the criteria for winners, anticipated number of participants, past number of participants (if the competition was held in the past), and how entries to the competition will be submitted. Competition proposals (or outcomes) will not be included in the proceedings.

  Panel Proposals  
 Friendly debate-style panels are welcome at FDG 2025. Panels for bringing attention to emerging areas and topics and encouraging their development are particularly valued. Interested researchers should consider finding panel-members interested in the discussion of the proposed topics before submitting their proposals. It is also important to consider diversity and speaker representation during the participant recruitment process. The maximum length for panel proposals is 2 pages (excluding references) in the ACM SIGCONF version of the ACM Primary Template  . Proposal contents should include the panel’s topic, participants, how the panel is organized, and a citation-supported statement of why the event is relevant and topical. Panels that address the conference’s theme are especially encouraged. Panel proposals will not be included in the proceedings.

  Call For Papers   
   
 The IEEE International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines is the original and premier forum for presenting and discussing new research related to computing that exploits the unique features and capabilities of FPGAs and other reconfigurable hardware. Over the past two decades, FCCM has been the place to present papers on architectures, tools, and programming models for field-programmable custom computing machines as well as applications that use such systems. This year FCCM seeks to embrace its role as the venue where “firsts” are presented by encouraging submissions describing new forward thinking research on emerging technologies with in-field reconfiguration capabilities for the upcoming post Moore’s Law era. Topics of interest include but are not limited to: Custom Computing and Reconfigurable Architectures: Heterogeneous and mixed signal digital/analog field customizable accelerators Neuromorphic emulation and accelerators Memory centric computing architectures Overlays, coarse grained reconfigurable architectures Clusters, data centers, and large systems IoT and Embedded SoC, MPSoC architectures with reconfigurable devices Security enhancements for reconfigurable computing Customizable soft processor systems Abstractions, Programming Models, and Tools: Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for FPGA design Domain-specific languages, frameworks, and open-source hw/sw synthesis/compilation tools Design tools, instrumentation, debug for designer productivity High-level synthesis Software-defined-systems (e.g. radio, networks, frameworks for new domains) CAD tools, abstractions, and languages for mixed analog/digital fabrics Run Time Reconfiguration: Run-time management and scheduling of reconfigurable hardware System resilience/fault tolerance for reconfigurable hardware Evolvable, adaptable, approximate, or autonomous reconfigurable computing systems Security assessment and enhancement of run-time reconfiguration Applications Evaluations and analysis on custom computing architectures with GPUs, NPUs, or DSPs Post Quantum Cryptography, Quantum control and emulation Safety critical, reliable and high assurance Security detection and prevention, and Side Channel analysis and Attack Digital twin, modeling, and acceleration FCCM 2025 is an in-person event. At least one author will be required to register and attend. (Submissions that fail to meet this requirement will not appear in IEEE Xplore.) Please refer to the FCCM website (www.fccm.org) for updates and details.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-09-16

  About FDG   
 The Foundations of Digital Games  (FDG) conference series seeks to promote the exchange of information concerning the scientific foundations of digital games, technology used to develop digital games, and the study of digital games and their design, broadly construed. The conference is held yearly in late Spring or early Summer, and attracts an international audience of 150-200 attendees. The focus of the conference is the presentation of papers describing novel research results. FDG is typically held in cooperation with one or more special interest groups of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the proceedings of the conference from 2008 onward are archived in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The conference series was originally created by Kent Foster and John Nordlinger at Microsoft, and was known as the Microsoft Academic Days on Game Development in Computer Science Education (GDCSE). The research focus of GDCSE was education using (and about) computer game technology. In 2009, the conference changed its name to the Foundations of Digital Games, and expanded its scope to become a "big tent" computer games research conference, covering a spectrum of computer game research topics while retaining a strong interest in educational uses of games. In the run-up to the 2009 conference, Microsoft transferred ownership and organization of the conference to the Society for the Advancement of the Study of Digital Games (SASDG)  , a nonprofit corporation with an academic board of directors.  
 Past proceedings may be found through the ACM Digital Library's collection: FDG: Foundations of Digital Games  .

  Call for Papers  
  
  The 27th Forum on specification and Design Languages (FDL) is an international event where academics and industrials exchange their results, experiences, advances, and new trends related to languages, tools, and techniques for developing software and hardware systems. Targeted systems encompass cyber-physical systems, distributed systems, real-time systems, embedded systems mechatronics, IoT, and reactive systems. FDL is based on the four following non-limiting scientific areas:  
  
  Languages | : Domain-specific languages for software, execution platforms, allocations environment, contracts, abstractions, and refinements are of interest, together with the associated design methods, frameworks, and tools. 
  Semantics | : formal definitions, compilers, interpreters, typing, abstraction/refinement, are of interest, together with the underlying specification frameworks or new approaches for their specification, modeling, and model transformation. 
  Verification and Analysis | : innovative static analysis, testing, debugging, model checking machine learning-based analysis, or design space exploration are of interest, together with the underlying models, tools and frameworks. 
  Simulation | : innovative simulation techniques, virtual prototypes, digital twins collaborative simulation, hybrid simulations, or runtime abstraction/refinement are of interest with special attention on the efficiency and correctness of simulations and their underlying tools and frameworks. 
   
  Cross-fertilization between the above areas, in particular in the context of system engineering, is of great interest. Therefore, we welcome authors to submit manuscripts on topics including, but not limited to:  
   
  languages and formalisms in model-based system design for modeling, testing, verification, and simulation; 
  languages for knowledge representation about system designs; 
  models of computations considering concurrency and time like dataflow computing, synchronous and functional languages, event-based languages, etc; 
  modeling languages and tools for modelling (cyber-)physical environments or networks; 
  formal methods and languages for modeling, specification, and verification; 
  system design for modern hardware architectures like multi/manycore processors, and heterogeneous platforms, accelerators including GPUs and FPGAs; 
  high-level hardware and software synthesis, virtual prototyping, and design space exploration; 
  modeling and programming languages for smart contracts and distributed ledger technologies; 
  case studies from typical application areas like healthcare, automotive, Industry 4.0, etc. 
   
  FDL stimulates scientific and controversial discussions within and between scientific topics at different maturity levels. The following categories of papers are presented orally at the conference and will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements:  
   
  Research Papers | : original papers with clear research contributions and evaluation (8 pages plus references). 
  Special Session Papers | : call for organizing special sessions on a specific topic (2-page session proposals). Papers within the special session follow the same peer reviewing and publishing process as for research papers (8 pages plus references). 
  Wild-and-Crazy-Idea Papers | : papers with well-explained fundamentally new ideas without rigorous evaluation (4 pages plus references). 
  Tool Papers | : papers about new tools, their methods and successful case studies (6 pages plus references). In contrast to research papers, tool papers may not describe new research ideas, and rather present on a solid implementation of existing methods that are made publically available to the community. 
   
  In addition to the above categories of papers, there will be the following further categories of papers which are not published with IEEE and are instead presented orally and distributed informally at the conference:  
   
  Work-in-progress Extended Abstracts | : submission of 2-page papers (extended abstracts) describing ongoing work where final results are not yet available but where potential solutions are already mature enough to be discussed at the conference. 
  Ph.D. Forum Extended Abstracts | : submission of 2-page papers (extended abstracts, single blind) about planned and ongoing work on Ph.D. thesis that can be discussed at the conference. 

  CFP Flyer  Please view or download the call for papers (CFP) flyer here.    

  Formatting and Submission Guidelines   
   
  Authors should submit papers in double columns, IEEE format as PDF through the submission system (see IEEE templates website https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html  for required templates). All submitted papers must describe original, unpublished work, and must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere.  
  Initial submissions are double-blind (to avoid initial bias), but author names become available to reviewers during discussion and before the final decision. Hence, note that you must not disclose your identity in the submitted paper. References to your own papers should still be included but referred to in the third person.  
  Submissions must be clearly tagged to determine the submission category by using the \IEEEspecialpapernotice keyword:  
   
  \IEEEspecialpapernotice{REGULAR PAPER SUBMISSION} 
  \IEEEspecialpapernotice{SPECIAL SESSION SUBMISSION} 
  \IEEEspecialpapernotice{WILD-AND-CRAZY-IDEA SUBMISSION} 
  \IEEEspecialpapernotice{TOOL PAPER SUBMISSION} 
  \IEEEspecialpapernotice{WORK-IN-PROGRESS SUBMISSION} 
  \IEEEspecialpapernotice{PHD FORUM SUBMISSION} 
   
  Please submit your paper via EasyChair using the following link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fdl24   
   
  Shepherding process   
   
  We will make use of a shepherding process if needed, where papers may first be conditionally accepted with specific guidelines on what needs be addressed to be accepted. An anonymous shepherd will be introduced for each conditionally accepted paper, who will guide and help the authors improve the paper for final acceptance. The aim is that all conditionally accepted papers should be finally accepted, so that the shepherding process is meant to improve the papers accordingly.

 Conference  News    
  
 The mission   of the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area.  
 The FedCSIS conference consists of the Main Track  and Thematic Session  . Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned, by their authors, to Topical Areas,  which are managed by Topical Area Curators  . Based on the scope of the contribution, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from the Main Track Program Committee   . Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Session, which announce their own Calls for Thematic Session Papers  and are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community.  
 For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Sessions also refer to the Intelligence Systems from different perspectives. They are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT.

27. Conference FDTC_3:
FDTC 2024: Workshop History  
 People and topics  
 The Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC) workshop brings together researchers and engineers from academia and industry who have an interest in the effect of faults, accidental or malicious, on digital devices that implement cryptographic algorithms.  
 The FDTC workshop includes topics such as: modeling the reliability of cryptographic systems and protocols; reliable cryptographic systems and algorithms; fault models for HW and SW cryptographic devices; fault injection attacks on cryptographic systems and protocols; classical and novel techniques of fault diagnosis and tolerance for cryptographic systems; and case studies.  
 Foundation and sequel  
 To promote the exchange of ideas among active researchers in this field, the first workshop devoted to Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC) was organized in June 2004 in Florence, Italy. The workshop has since then become an annual event which travels through Europe, America and Asia.  
 A selection of papers from the first three sessions of FDTC (2004-05-06) is published in the LNCS series by Springer-Verlag and is available via SpringerLink  . Since 2007, the proceedings of FDTC are published by Conference Publishing Services and are available on the IEEE Digital Library  .

 About FedCSIS  
 Conference webpage: Home | FedCSIS 2025   
 The mission   of the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area of computer science.  
 The FedCSIS conference consists of the  Main Track   and  Thematic Tracks  . Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned by their authors to  Topical Areas   which are managed by  Topical Area Curators  . Basing on a paper’s scope, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from the  Main Track  Program Committee   . Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Tracks which are announced in their own  Calls for Thematic Track Papers   and are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community.  
 FedCSIS Conference Series Timeline  
 2005: the story begins  
 The first event that the history of FedCSIS conference series can be traced to, took place in 2005. It was the Scientific Session organized within the scope of the 2005 Autumn Meeting of the Polish Information Processing Society (PIPS).  
 2006: first full-blown conference  
 In 2006, the first event under the name International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Systems (IMCSIT) took place. It was co-located with the 2006 Autumn Meeting of the Polish Information Processing Society. The IMCSIT multiconference was co-located with the Autumn Meetings of PIPS till 2010, when IMCSIT became an independent event under the new name (FedCSIS) and with a somewhat modified formula.  
 2007: data loss  
 In 2007 computers holding data related to the 2005 and 2006 events have been sabotaged by hackers and the web sites for the two events have been lost. What remained intact, were the 2005 and 2006 proceedings, which can be found in conference archive  .  
 2009: IFAC Workshop  
 In 2009, within the scope of the IMCSIT conference, the 30 th  IFAC Workshop on Real-Time Programming was organized. It resulted in an  independent proceedings volume  .  
 2011: FedCSIS is born  
 In 2011, the first edition of the Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS) took place. The change in name was related to the recognition that the term multiconference became questionable, due to a number of bad quality multiconferences organized around the world. It was also an initial attempt to bring more structure to the event.  
 2014 and 2015: special events  
 In 2014 and 2015 two special (dissemination) workshops have been organized within the scope of respective FedCSIS conferences. They were: “E2LP Workshop Application of Innovative Teaching Methods in Embedded Engineering” and “QMR Workshop on Logics for Qualitative Modelling and Reasoning”. Both those events resulted from funded projects and produced their own proceedings, which can be found in the conference archive  . We plan to host dissemination events in the future and welcome proposals to organize them.  
 2014: position papers introduced  
 In 2014, for the first time, a separate volume containing position papers was produced. Position papers relate to an ongoing research or experience. There are two types of position papers:  
 Challenge papers  propose and describe research challenges in theory or practice of computer science and information/intelligence systems. The papers in this category must be based on deep understanding of existing research or industrial problems. Based on such understanding and experience, they need to define new exciting research directions and show why these directions are crucial to the society at large.  
 Emerging research papers  present preliminary research results from work-in-progress based on sound scientific approach but presenting work not completely validated as yet. They must describe precisely the research problem and its rationale. They must also define precisely the intended future work including the expected benefits from solution to the tackled problem. Subsequently, they may be more conceptual than experimental.  
 2014: data minining competition  
 2014 was also the first time we organized a data mining competition associated with the FedCSIS conference. Since then, such FedCSIS data-science-style challenges have been organized almost every year, using the specialized online platform KnowledgePit  . Every year, one can find in the FedCSIS program – and in the FedCSIS proceedings – Technical Sessions focused on the discussion of competition results and descriptions of the winning solutions submitted by the data science teams from around the world.  
 2017: communication papers introduced  
 In 2017, communication papers were introduced as a separate category of contributions (in a separate volume). They report on research topics worthy of immediate communication. They may be used to mark a hot new research territory or to describe work in progress in order to quickly present it to scientific community. They may also contain additional information omitted from the earlier papers or may present software tools and products in a research state.  
 2019: numbering of conferences  
 In 2019, we realized that the number of conferences that had been organized in the series has reached the level where it may be valuable to indicate that this is the 14 th  edition of the event.  
 2020: adjusting conference structure  
 In 2020, conference structure was evaluated on the basis of 14 years of experiences. As a result, five tracks were introduced, while events that had been loosely grouped into areas, were aligned within tracks, becoming their Technical Sessions. This structural alignment resulted in dropping the term “federated” from the name, while keeping the acronym FedCSIS. The latter was a deliberate decision, aiming at showing historical continuity of the event.  
 2021: CORE B ranking  
 During the 2020–21 evaluation cycle the FedCSIS conference series has obtained category B  in the CORE ranking.  We are very proud that we have reached this recognition, while not being part of earlier ranking. This shows that we have developed a valuable scientific event. This also gives us guidance how to proceed to obtain even higher ranking in the next round.  
   
 2021: adjusting conference name  
 FedCSIS conference series is evolving with the world. This evolution is based on recognizing changes in the world around us. One of them is the raise of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics. As a result, it is our belief that “information systems” of the old are becoming “intelligence infused systems” of today. As a matter of fact, it becomes difficult to point to information systems that do not contain components realizing some form of, broadly understood, artificial intelligence. Hence, we have decided that from this year on the name of the conference series will become “Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS)”. As can be seen, we are the same FedCSIS, but adjusted to the world of 2020s.  
 2021: Professor Zdisław Pawlak Award becomes an all-FedCSIS recognition  
 The Zdzisław Pawlak Awards   have been always of great importance for the FedCSIS community. In his research, late Professor Pawlak – undoubtedly one of the fathers of computer science and intelligence systems – has always emphasized a need of cross-disciplinary, cross-country and cross-generation cooperation. Therefore, in 2021, we decided to broaden the range of awards and established the following categories as eligible for all Tracks and all Technical Sessions  of the FedCSIS conference:  
 Best Paper Award  (€600): the best out of all papers accepted to the conference; 
  Young Researcher Paper Award  (€400): the best out of papers whereby all authors are younger than 40 years; 
  Industry Cooperation Award  (€400): the best out of papers whereby there are at least two different authors, one working in academia and another one in industry; 
  International Cooperation Award  (€400): the best out of papers whereby there are at least two different authors working in institutions located in two different countries. 
  We believe that all these new categories reflect the principles of Professor Pawlak’s work. This is also the belief of our new long-term strategic partner – the QED Software  company – which co-finances the above awards.  
 2022: anniversaries  
 The FedCSIS story becomes longer and longer. We believe in continuity, tradition and evolution. Accordingly, we appreciate other long-term conference initiatives and we always welcome them if they want to join our FedCSIS community. In 2022, two out of FedCSIS Technical Sessions are particularly worth mentioning with this respect:  
 The first of them is the CS&P  symposium. Although held within FedCSIS for the first time, this is going to be actually the 30th event organized in the CS&P series  !  
 The second anniversary goes back to Professor Zdzisław Pawlak again. In 2022, it is 40 years since he has founded Rough Sets, one of his most recognized achievements. With this respect, it is our great pleasure to re-establish the RSTA  series focused on foundations and applications of this theory.  
 Such anniversaries will always have the very special place in the FedCSIS conference program.

 This is an international event where academics and industrials exchange their results, experiences, advances, and new trends related to languages, tools, and techniques for developing software and hardware systems. Targeted systems encompass cyber-physical systems, distributed systems, real-time systems, embedded systems, mechatronics, IoT, and reactive systems. FDL focuses on the four following non-limiting scientific areas:   
 Languages | : Domain-specific languages for software, execution platforms, allocations, environment, contracts, abstractions, and refinements are of interest, together with the associated design methods, frameworks, and tools. 
  Simulation | : innovative simulation techniques, virtual prototypes, digital twins, collaborative simulation, hybrid simulations, or runtime abstraction/refinement are of interest, with special attention on the efficiency and correctness of simulations and their underlying tools and frameworks. 
  Semantics | : formal definitions, compilers, interpreters, typing, abstraction/refinement, are of interest, together with the underlying specification frameworks or new approaches for their specification, modeling, and model transformation. 
  Verification and Analysis | : innovative static analysis, testing, debugging, model checking, machine learning-based analysis, or design space exploration are of interest, together with the underlying models, tools and frameworks. 
  FDL 2024 invites a range of submissions:   
 research papers and special session papers (8 pages + references) are original papers with clear scientific research contributions and evaluations. 
  wild-and-crazy-idea papers (4 pages+references) with well-explained fundamentally new ideas without rigorous evaluation. 
  tool papers (4 pages+references) may not describe new research ideas, but present new tools of possibly existing methods that are made publicly available to the community. 
  work-in-progress papers and extended abstracts to the Ph.D. Student Forum and Summer School (2 pages) describe planned and ongoing work mature enough to be presented at the conference. 
  Call for Special Sessions   
 Special Sessions should propose a topic which is of particular interest to the FDL audience. They consist of two to four invited talks. Speakers are requested to either submit a one-page abstract of their presentation, or to submit a short or full paper that goes through the regular review and publication process.   
 Potential organisers of a Special Session must submit a brief proposal (no more than two pages) which describes the topic, the intended audience, as well as a list of possible speakers to  fdl24@easychair.org    
 All accepted papers will appear in the informal electronic proceedings, handed out at the conference. Research papers, special session papers, tool papers and wild-and-crazy-idea papers will be published in electronic form on IEEE Xplore. In the past, extended versions of selected papers were also published in a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Systems (TECS).   
 Submissions are welcome at:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fdl24    
 Important Deadlines (23:59 Anywhere on Earth)   
 Special Sessions: | April 15, 2024 
  Paper Deadline: | Apr 24, 2024 
  PhD/WiP Deadline: | July 12, 2024

 Call For Papers  Tom Duhamel    2024-09-11T06:19:57-04:00  T-BIOM Call For Papers  
 IEEE Biometrics Council is pleased to announce the launch of IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science (T-BIOM)  . It will be a quarterly Transactions and the first issue will be published in January 2019. T-BIOM  publishes original articles on all aspects of biometrics (i.e. recognizing people through their physiological or behavioral traits such as face, fingerprint, iris, and signature), including theory, applications, systems, and surveys. Biometrics are personal identity characteristics where people are recognized by who they are rather than by what they own; behavior is the typical movement of a person that is unique and identifiable; identity science underlies the application of biometrics. Papers focusing on ramifications of these areas will also be welcomed, such as security of such systems, standards for their deployment, and new architectures and systems are also welcomed. Broad topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Biometric modalities | Management of human identities using traditional behavioral and physiological characteristics (biometric modalities) including Face, Fingerprint, Iris, Periocular, Palmprint, Gait, Ear, and Voice. 
  Emerging biometrics including social and behavioral biometrics, gesture based biometrics, keystroke, vascular, knuckle, and soft information/biometrics such as quality, age, gender, kinship, social context, and biographic analysis 
  Multibiometrics including fusion approaches 
  Novel biometric sensors 
  Person re-identification 
  Detection, tracking, identification, and de-identification in surveillance 
  Mobile biometrics, active authentication 
  Novel (challenging) biometrics databases, protocol and benchmarking, large scale evaluation, confidence interval estimation, and performance modeling and prediction 
  Pattern classification and machine learning, including deep learning, algorithms for biometrics and identity science 
  Behavior analysis related to biometrics and identity science: | Biometrics and human behavior analysis, human activity understanding, and behavior modeling 
  Modeling the interplay of behavioral modalities with applications in biometrics and security 
  Security of biometrics and identity systems: | Adversarial attacks on biometric systems 
  Biometrics presentation attack detection, template protection, template update, and data protection 
  Applications: | Forensic analysis in identity and activity 
  Applications of biometrics and identity in privacy preserving computing, user centric security, usable privacy and security, social and criminal network inference, privacy protection and enhancement 
  Applications of biometrics in law enforcement and cybercrime, finance, smart-cards, border control, healthcare, civil registry, access control, securing documents, fraud detection, cloud, and entertainment.

 Types of submissions   
 There are three kinds of submissions:   
 Full paper  – a paper describing mature novel research,  up to 6 pages  excluding  references  that will be published in the proceedings, and will be presented by the author in a 20 minute oral presentation. 
  Short paper  – a paper that shows some novelty and general interest  but is more preliminary or in the early stages of development  ,  up to 4 pages  excluding  references  that  get published in the proceedings  ,  and will be presented by the author in a  10  minute oral presentation. 
  Poster paper,   up to 2 pages  excluding  references  that will be published as a poster paper,  and will be presented by the author in a  a poster session. 
  Rejected full papers might be accepted as short papers or posters, if reviewers found interest in the idea but the paper quality was not sufficient to be published in full length.   
 Appendices after the references are permitted but might not be reviewed, and appendices will not be permitted in the final version of the paper if it is accepted.   
 Double-blind reviewing  is used, so submitted papers  must use fake/anonymized author names and affiliations  . Papers must use the latest  template  and must be submitted as PDF.   
 FLAIRS will not accept any paper which, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their papers elsewhere during FLAIRS's review period. These restrictions apply only to journals and conferences, not to workshops and similar specialized presentations with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. Authors will be required to confirm that their submissions conform to these requirements at the time of submission.   
 Proceedings   
 The proceedings of FLAIRS-38 will be published by Florida Online Journals (  https://journals.flvc.org/   ) which is indexed in DBLP and Scopus. Authors are expected to make a reasonable effort to address reviewers’ comments prior to the submission of the camera-ready paper. Where such expectations have been flouted, actions may be taken to preserve the quality of the conference and the expectations of conference goers. In order for a paper to be published in the proceedings, all accepted papers (full, short and poster) must be accompanied by at least one AUTHOR REGISTRATION. It is also expected that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present their work. A single author may have up to a maximum of two papers per AUTHOR REGISTRATION. Author names may be changed or re-ordered after reviewing; however, for budgetary reasons, registration fees will be based on the details at the time of submission and review.   
 P  aper submission   
 Paper submission is  a two-step process.  First, the paper abstract  must  be registered in EasyChair by the  Paper abstract submiss  ion deadline  . Then, the full paper in PDF is due by the  Paper submission deadline  .  W  ithout registering  an  abstract on time,  it will not be possible  to submit the paper later.   
 For each accepted paper there must be an accompanying AUTHOR REGISTRATION. A single author may have up to a maximum of two papers per AUTHOR REGISTRATION. Author names may be changed or re-ordered after reviewing; however, for budgetary reasons, registration fees will be based on the details at the time of submission and review.

 The Florida    
 Artificial Intelligence    
 Research Society    

 The Florida AI Research Society was founded in 1987 to promote and advance Artificial Intelligence within the State of Florida, including interaction between researchers at the various colleges, universities, and industry. Membership is open to all (Florida residents and non-residents) that attend the yearly conference.   
 From its inception, one major goal of the society has been to promote AI through a conference. These conferences have been held yearly since the spring of 1988. During the first two years, participation was restricted to State of Florida residents. Since 1990, the conference has been open to all. In 1995 the conference title was changed to "The International FLAIRS Conference" to recognize the contribution of the international participants within the conference. The last several years has seen a fairly even split of conference participants between Floridians, North Americans, and Internationals.   
 Devoted to the promotion of Artificial Intelligence in the State of Florida.

 LONDON METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY  

 London Metropolitan University has a rich history with strong educational roots dating back to 1848. Over the past 100 years, our north London campus has developed into a modern progressive centre with a strong reputation for widening access into education. London is one of the greatest cities in the world, but while Londoners enjoy some of the highest standards of living anywhere in the world for many others in the capital it is a different story. Through our civic network, we are on a mission to tackle the inequalities facing London, to improve people’s lives and to deliver social justice.  
  Our high-quality research forms a core part of the life of London Met and underpins all that we do. Research covers everything from teaching thousands of undergraduates supervising several hundred students on PhD and Professional Doctorate programmes conducting funded research, or working with our many partners. London Met is home to a number of research centres, groups that provide a focal point for staff and research students. They give definition and direction to the work that we do.  

 The School of Computing and Digital Media offers high-quality teaching underpinned by strong industry-relevant research. The School provides undergraduate, postgraduate and professional courses within one of three subject areas:  
 Computer science and applied computing – including computing, software engineering and cyber security. 
  Communications technology and mathematics – including systems engineering, robotics, electronics and mathematics. 
  Creative technologies and digital media – including film, media, games, journalism and music. 
  The School has established partnerships with other higher education institutions both nationally and internationally – we have partner institutions in countries such as Nepal, Trinidad, Sri Lanka, Spain and Germany as well as in the UK.  

 The AI and Data Science research group (AI & DS) is proud to host FICTA 2025.  
   
 The school has a number of research centres and groups, including The AI and Data Science research group (AI&DS) has a long history dating back to 1999 (known then as the Intelligent Systems research group) of fulfilling its aim to improve the quality of products, services and security issues by the incorporation and application of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics and visualisation techniques. The group has improved a wide variety of digital systems, devices, and software in domestic, medical and industrial settings; and provided automated solutions to a variety of complex social challenges. A recent important research grant challenge that the ISRG has been involved with is the new Horizon 2020 European Grant. The ISRG, as part of a consortium of 17 EU partners, began working on the grant in August 2018. The grant is worth five million euros, distributed between 17 partners. The project has now been successfully completed and the impact of this research is highly significant to the British economy security, public health and the community as the main initial beneficiaries are West Midlands Regional Police and Thames Valley Police. AI & DS research group has successfully hosted the 12th edition of this conference FICTA 2024  in the recent past; and now feels proud to host the 13th edition of this conference FICTA 2025  .

 About the Journal  
 Aims & Scope   
 The Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society (FLAIRS) was founded in 1987 to promote and advance AI within the State of Florida and beyond, with interaction between researchers from colleges, universities, and industry. The annual International FLAIRS Conference promotes Artificial Intelligence through the presentation of new research and development in AI, as papers, posters, tutorials, and workshops at the conference, and a conference proceedings.   
 History of the Conference and the Proceedings   
 Since its inception, one major goal of FLAIRS has been to promote AI through a conference with a published proceedings. The conferences have been held yearly since 1988. From 1988-1997, the proceedings were published independently by the society. Those proceedings can be accessed through the Archives on this website  . In 1998, FLAIRS came to agreement with the American Association for Artificial Intelligence to have the proceedings published by AAAI Press, which continued to 2020. Those proceedings can be accessed through the AAAI Digital Library  . Since 2021, the proceedings have been published by Florida Online Journals, through an association with the George A. Smathers Libraries and the LibraryPress@UF  .  
 Authorship with AI Systems   
 It is FLAIRS's policy that AI systems do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers. Attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, which cannot be effectively applied to AI systems. Thus FLAIRS does not allow the use of AI systems for writing the content of papers. At the same time, FLAIRS places no restrictions on the use of editing tools, including AI systems, to help authors present their research in clear modern English. Ultimately, authors are responsible for the entire content of their papers. Authors are expected to adhere honestly to this policy.  
 Peer Review Process   
 Papers submitted to FLAIRS are reviewed by at least three expert reviewers, who each submit a written review and recommendation to the program or special track chairs. Double-blind reviewing is used, so submitted papers must use fake/anonymized author names and affiliations. FLAIRS will not accept any paper which, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their papers elsewhere during FLAIRS's review period. These restrictions apply only to journals and conferences, not to workshops and similar specialized presentations with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. The acceptance decisions are made by the program and special track chairs, in consultation with the reviewers if necessary. There is no rebuttal period. The submission deadline and date of notification are provided on each conference web page.  
 Plagiarism   
 FLAIRS does not accept articles containing material plagiarized from other publications or authors. For the purposes of this policy, plagiarism is defined as copying of or reliance on work - including text, images and data - by others or yourself without proper attribution. FLAIRS does not consider the following situations to be plagiarism when proper attribution is made:  
 Translations into English of a previously published paper not in English. 
  Publication of all or part of a revised thesis or dissertation. 
  Publication of a paper previously made public as a workshop presentation, white paper, technical report, or preprint. 
  Plagiarism detected prior to publication will cause rejection of your manuscript. Plagiarism detected after publication will cause the published article to be removed from the conference proceedings. FLAIRS may follow workflows developed by the Committee on Publication Ethics  to deal with cases of plagiarism.  
 Open Access and Copyright   
 As of FLAIRS-34 (2021), the FLAIRS proceedings are published under a Creative Commons CC BY-NC license, which provides open access to its content. Authors retain copyright to their publications. Authors are permited and encouraged to post items submitted to the journal on personal websites or institutional repositories both prior to and after publication, while providing bibliographic details that credit, if applicable, its publication in this journal. Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles in the proceedings without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author for non-commercial purposes. Nonetheless, reproduction, posting, transmission or other distribution or use of the article or any material therein requires credit to the original publication source with a link to both the article and the license. This open access policy is in accordance with the Budapest Open Access Initiative's  (BOAI) definition of open access.  
 Governance   
 The FLAIRS conferences and the publication of the conference proceedings fall under the governance of the Florida AI Research Society, its bylaws, and the officers of the board. See https://www.flairs.com/corporate  
 Fees and Charges   
 There are no publication charges, and all content is freely available without charge. The proceedings do not include any advertising. FLAIRS is financed almost entirely by conference registration fees (sponsorship provides minor secondary support); at least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for and attend the conference to present the research.  
 Diversity and Inclusion   
 The University of Florida is committed to creating a community that reflects the rich racial, cultural, and ethnic diversity of the state and nation. FLAIRS contributes to this mission by promoting inclusivity through supporting open access; actively encouraging greater representation across cultures, backgrounds, and viewpoints; and fostering transparency and openness throughout the publishing cycle.  
 Preservation Policy   
 Content published in the proceedings will be preserved by the George A. Smathers Libraries at the University of Florida. The Libraries are committed to long-term digital preservation of all materials in UF-supported collaborative projects. Redundant digital archives, adherence to proven standards, and rigorous quality control methods protect digital objects. The UF Digital Collections provide a comprehensive approach to digital preservation, including technical supports, reference services for both online and offline archived files, and support services by providing training and consultation for digitization standards for long-term digital preservation. Content will be preserved indefinitely, unless a specific request for removal of a specific item is directed to the journal managers. If you believe that your copyrighted material has been deposited into any proceedings without consent, please contact the administrators.  
 Content is also preserved in the PKP Preservation Network (PKP PN) and CLOCKSS.

 PLMW@ICFP'24: Final call for Participation (travel funding application by June 21)  
 APPLICATION FOR PLMW TRAVEL FUNDING For full consideration for scholarship funding, please apply at the link below by June 21, AoE. We will notify accepted attendees in a rolling fashion until all funding is committed. The application can be accessed at the following URL (Apply by June 21, 2024 AOE for full consideration!): https://forms.gle/vC6udnMWRvvAczPR6 —-------------------------------------------------------------- ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) at ICFP 24, Milan, Italy Workshop: Monday, September 2, 2024 Website: https://icfp24.sigplan.org/home/PLMW-ICFP-2024 PLMW is a workshop co-located with ICFP 2024 (the International Conference on Functional Programming) in Milan, Italy, from September 2-7. The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage graduate students and senior undergraduate students to pursue careers in programming language research. This workshop will bring together world leaders in programming languages research and teaching from academia and industry to help students imagine how they might contribute to our research community. Topics will range from the abstract (e.g., what is PL research and how does one become involved in it) to the concrete (e.g., how to navigate an academic conference, how to pick a research area) as well as technical talks on cutting-edge topics. We especially encourage women and underrepresented minority students, and people with disabilities to attend PLMW. This workshop is part of the activities surrounding ICFP, and takes place the day before the main conference. One goal of the workshop is to make the ICFP conference more accessible to newcomers. We hope that participants will stay through the entire conference. Note that ICFP and PLMW are planned to be largely in-person events. While we recognize that travel to conferences is not easy for everyone, we do hope you will be able to join us in person to get the most out of the conference and its community-building aspects. A number of sponsors have generously donated scholarship funds for qualified students to attend PLMW. These scholarships can cover expenses (airfare, hotel, and registration fees) for attendance at both the workshop and the ICFP conference. Students attending this year will get one year free student membership of SIGPLAN, unless they prefer to opt out during their application. The workshop registration is open to all. Students with alternative sources of funding are welcome as well.
