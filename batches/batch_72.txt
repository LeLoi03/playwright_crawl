 VLSID-2025 Important Guidelines for Fellowship Aspirants   
 Introduction:  
    
  VLSID-2025 organizing committee wishes to offer fellowships to a few faculty and meritorious students who don’t have any financial support from their parent institution to attend the conference.  
 Students or faculty members applying for the fellowships should preferably be involved in research areas related to VLSI Design and Embedded Systems or areas aligning to the theme of the conference.  
 Participants applying for a fellowship who already have partial funding from their institution are expected to kindly specify the support you need while completing the application. Hence, aspiring candidates for fellowship awards are advised to opt for these reimbursements only on the need basis, as your genuine discretion would help the organizing committee to award fellowship to more aspirants.  

 Expectation from the Fellows:   
 Conference registration is complimentary for the fellows. Once selected for fellowship (will be intimated via email as per the dates on the Fellowship-page), it is mandatory that the fellows should confirm their acceptance by submitting a soft copy of a DD (INR 5000). More details will be provided in the fellowship intimation email to the selected applicants. 
  The DD will be returned if the fellow completes the entire mandatory requirement mentioned for the award of the fellowship including full attendance from 04.01.2025 to 08.01.2025 and submit the conference summary report. 
  It is imperative that the fellows attend tutorials and presentations on all the conference days. | Authors of regular papers, User Design Track participants, Design Contest participants and Student Research Forum/PhD Forum participants, if they have received fellowship, are expected to adhere to the fellowship guidelines. 
  A biometric record of attendance for each session per day would be maintained for the same. They have to submit a report of talks attended (as per prescribed format given to fellows on the opening day) and should give it to the Fellowship chair on 08.01.2025. 
  Lack of attendance/non-submission of report may result in cancellation of the DD reimbursement and travel/accommodation expenses. 
  Kindly note that fellows have to plan their journey such that they reach the conference on 04.01.2025 to attend tutorials. They will leave only after 5pm on 08.01.2024 from the conference venue. Late arrival and early departure requests will not be entertained. In such cases, the fellowship committee reserves the rights to forfeit a partial amount of the registration fees. 

 Travel support details:   
 The organizing committee is mainly interested in reimbursing the partial travel expenses for fellowship awardees from the distant cities/towns. Due to budget limitations and to accommodate maximum fellows, the travel support will be to a maximum of INR 10,000 for faculty and INR 6000 for student. 
  Travel expenses if approved for reimbursement will be calculated as per shortest route of travel by | For faculty: AC 3-Tier in Train/economy class flight/bus up to a maximum of INR 10,000/- or actual (whichever is lower). 
  For students/scholars: AC 3-Tier in Train/AC bus up to a maximum of INR 6,000/- or actual (whichever is lower). If someone travels on a higher mode (air) of transport only the eligible class fare (3AV/AC bus) will be reimbursed. 

 Accommodation support details:   
 The VLSID-2025 organizing team plans to provide free accommodation (double/triple sharing or dormitory) nearer to the venue to student fellows from outside Bengaluru. Final information regarding place of stay and other logistics will be informed later to the fellows.

 CALL FOR PROPOSALS TO HOST FUTURE VRSTs  
 Abstract 
  Proposals should address the following issues: 
  Attention 
    
 The Steering Committee welcomes proposals for hosting and organizing future VRSTs ( http://vrst.acm.org  ). It is typically held in October or in November, and care should be taken to avoid date conflicts (with regard to the event and submission deadlines) with international conferences or other events such as SIGGRAPH Asia, UIST, ISS, ISMAR, ICAT, and EGVE, that attract a similar audience and overlap regarding topics. VRST is sponsored by ACM SIGCHI and SIGGRAPH. VRST attracts an interdisciplinary audience from HCI and VR, engineering, science, design, psychology, education, medicine, and the arts, and provides a platform for discussion and meeting people. We value diversity and aim to learn from other perspectives. VRST customarily had a single presentation track for all oral presentations of papers (full and short) and other presentation categories (typically posters and demos). But they come to be presented in parrel sessions recently.  
   
  After receiving the proposal, the VRST Steering Committee will make a decision within approximately two months. Please email your proposal as a pdf document to steeringcommittee@vrst.hosting.acm.org.  

 People involved in the bid and their roles (at minimum, a symposium and papers chair). Please include a short bio for core people and highlight involvement in previous VRSTs and with the VR/HCI community 
  Commitment to publish the proceedings with ACM and to apply for ACM sponsorship (carefully read | Conference Planning Guide | ) 
  Likely sponsors and subsidies 
  Budget overview (venue hire, etc.) and anticipated financial model. For this purpose, look at the ACM Technical Meeting Request Form (TMRF) requirements and include a sketch of the answers to the main questions, and an idea of how your overall budget will map onto the ACM issues. Note that a Preliminary Approval Form (PAF) is expected to be submitted by 18 months prior to the conference, and the TMRF needs to be approved at least 12 months prior to the conference. 
  Rough idea of likely costs for visitors (estimates only): registration rates for students and non-students (including the dinner) 
  Proposed location, how to reach it and details about a possible venue 
  Potential date(s) for the conference 
  Estimated time for issuing the CFP, submission deadlines and registration deadlines 
  Arguments for why VRST as proposed by you will be attractive to the VR/HCI community (e.g. accessibility, international rotation, location, relation to specific sub-communities, ability to attract both new and 'old' conference visitors) 
  Organizational support at the hosting location 
  Any direction/theme change you would envisage and any new features/tracks you would like to include 

 Carefully read | Organizer Resources | . 
  Effectively use | community supports for different types of Conference Support, Community Support and Student Support for members, conferences and student members. | We would suggest a link from your website to this information so your delegates can find it. 
  ACM affirms the principle that its conferences shall be accessible to any and all persons, and will make every reasonable effort to accommodate their needs for attendance and participation. (Read | ACM Accessibility Statement | ) The ACM Special Interest Group on Accessibility (SIGACCESS) has issued an | Accessible Conference Guide | with information on digital and physical accessibility standards.

  About 

 VTC2025-Spring Oslo     > About      

 The IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (VTS) hosts several conferences each year so that scientists, engineers, students, technicians, and others who are interested in advancing research and development in vehicular technology and mobile networks may exchange ideas in an enjoyable and stimulating environment.  
 VTS first started its own conference, the flagship Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC), in 1950 in Detroit, MI, USA, as strictly a mobile radio conference. But as technology advanced, VTC expanded its focus to land transportation, vehicular electronics, and wireless communications. In 1999 the Society made a bold move to offer VTC twice a year, once in the spring and again in the fall, and in 2013 it became the sole sponsor of another conference on Vehicle Power and Propulsion (VPPC). The latest edition to our suite of conferences is Wireless Africa (WAC) that began in 2018.  
 Our Society has grown into a global organization supporting many diverse events across the world promoting the development and standardization of new technology. Thus, your participation in VTS events gives you a platform to influence the direction of the technology that connects the mobile world. Our conferences are open to all members of the technical community, and I would like to personally invite you to attend.  
 If you are interested in hosting one of the VTS conferences in your area, please contact one of the conference administrators listed below for information and instructions on how to submit a proposal.  
 Thank you.

 Venue and Transportation  
 Western Sydney University - Parramatta City Campus (169 Macquarie Street Parramatta)   
   
 For the first time in its history the conference will be hosted in Australia. The city of Sydney is the cultural, historic and business centre of the country and will be home for VRST 2019. The conference will be held in Western Sydney University’s new Parramatta City Campus (1PSQ)  in the Parramatta  CBD. This flagship 10-storey campus is located close to public transport, including trains, ferries and buses and is easily accessible from Sydney CBD. Parramatta is the historic heart of Sydney's west that features beautiful parks and colonial sites as well as world-class food, arts and entertainment.  
    
 Travel  : Sydney Kingsford Smith is a major international airport. Return airfares (Qantas) from Los Angeles in November 2019 are around USD 1000 and from Frankfurt: around EUR 1100. Parramatta CBD is easily accessible by train from the International Airport. Travel time is 45 minutes and current cost is AUD 18. There is a direct train from the Parramatta Station (5 min walk from the venue) that goes to the Sydney Central Station. The train ride takes 25 minutes. There are public ferries (boats) that travel directly from Parramatta to the Sydney Opera House. You will need to purchase an Opal Card for travel on public transport whilst here.  
 Accommodation:  Parramatta CBD is a large business centre with many hotels around. The conference organisers can secure conference rates (10% discount) with the following hotels: Novotel Sydney Parramatta and Mercure Sydney Parramatta. These hotels are located at walking distance to the venue. Prices for November 2019 range from AUD 180 to AUD 260. Another alternative is to use Western Sydney University Village, where accommodation is available starting from AUD 80. A free shuttle bus regularly travels from the University Village to the conference venue.

 Effects of Variations in 3D Spatial Search Techniques on Mobile Query Speed vs Accuracy    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 This paper presents three Spatial Search Algorithms for determiningthe three dimensional visibility shape (threat dome) at a user’s current locationin a built environment. Users then utilize this 3D shape as their query“window” to retrieve information on only those objects visible within a spatialdatabase. Visibility shape searching addresses the information overloadproblem by providing “Hidden Query Removal” functionality for mobile LBS.This functionality will be especially useful in the Web 4.0 era when trillions ofmicro-sensors become available for query through standard IP access.   

 ARCAMA-3D - A Context-Aware Augmented Reality Mobile Platform for Environmental Discovery

 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.17-26 

 In this paper, we present ARCAMA-3D, a platform for 3D map-based visualization on mobile devices powered by augmented reality. The platform offers context-aware interactions related to the concept of ubiquitous computing. The general purpose of the project is to enable users to navigate in an area with their mobile devices and interactively discover their surroundings. The system integrates real-time sensing technologies (GPS and other embedded sensors) and exploits user's context and preferences in order to provide her with the necessary information. In return, the user consults the information (text, photo, audio or video files, etc.) that is published on the 3D model with the help of augmented reality. The innovative aspect of our approach lies in a light-weight 3D visualization system which is superimposed on the real scene. This approach facilitates the discovery of surroundings without preventing the visualization of real entities. We also alleviate the cognitive load of the user by avoiding the presentation of excessive information.   

 Speech and Multimodal Interaction in Mobile GIS Search: A Case of Study    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.27-32 

 The In this short paper we will present an Android mobile application making use of a multimodal interface. We base our application on a proprietary architecture based on the W3C recommendation MM-Framework. App-users can talk and use natural gestures on a mobile device touch screen in order to formulate a complex interrogation to a geo-referenced web service. The interaction produce as result a query whose origin is a semantically incomplete audio sentence complete by a deictic gesture (i.e.: "please, find all bus stops in this area - - while tapping or making a circle on the screen where a map is showed - -").   

 Asynchronous Ultrasonic Trilateration for Indoor Positioning of Mobile Phones    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 In this paper we discuss how the innate ability of mobile phone speakers to produce ultrasound can be used for accurate indoor positioning. The frequencies in question are in a range between 20 and 22 KHz, which is high enough to be inaudible by humans but still low enough to be generated by today’s mobile phone sound hardware. Our tests indicate that it is possible to generate the given range of frequencies without significant distortions, provided the signal volume is not turned excessively high. In this paper we present and evaluate the accuracy of our asynchronous trilateration method (Lok8) for mobile positioning without requiring knowledge of the time the ultrasonic signal was sent. This approach shows that only the differences in time of arrival to multiple microphones (control points) placed throughout the indoor environment is sufficient. Consequently, any timing issues with client and server synchronization are avoided.   

 A Semantic Resolver for Coordinate Reference Systems    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) are at the heart of geo services. A large number of very different CRSs is in active use worldwide. EPSG maintains a well-known inventory of geodetic CRSs upon which most service implementations and also the standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium rely. For recent data and services, however, this set turns out insufficient - time series, climate and ocean data, etc. require time axes and non-spatio-temporal axes in addition. Further, when retrieving slices from geo data cubes, new, unforeseen CRSs need to be constructed on the fly, such as lat/t or lon/z CRSs. To achieve a uniform handling of all CRSs we propose a URL-based identification scheme. This scheme naturally extends OGC’s EPSG identification URLs with parametrized CRSs and ad-hoc CRS and axis combination. Our approach currently is under discussion within OGC for adoption as a standard. We have implemented a CRS resolver based on this concept which accepts identification URLs and returns corresponding GML definitions. The resolver is available publicly to study and demonstrate feasibility of URL-based CRS naming schemes. In this paper we summarize the concept and implementation of the resolver as a service following the described name type specification.   

 Visualization with a New Visual Metaphor for Hierarchical and Stratified Temporal Domain    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.57-71 

 Studies have proved that 80% of data has a spatial reference [1] and it would be reasonable to assume that the temporal reference has a similar relevance. Spatio-temporal data visualization assumes an important role in the data presentation to users. Offering a synchronized view on three dimensions of data (i. e. descriptive, temporal and spatial) helps users in their knowledge discovery process. In some fields, like Cultural Heritage, time assumes an important role to explore data. The same timeline could be view in different thematic context, temporal domain could be stratified and the time reference could be qualitative and imprecise. Managing this kind of features improves the ability of the users to recognize pattern in data. In this paper is presented a spatio-temporal data visualization application that shows a new method to explore hierarchical and stratified temporal domains with imprecise temporal reference. The application interface offers a high level of personalization. Users can choose between different type of views and visual metaphors to compare objects on geobrowser activating or disabling layers of their interest. Interface is open and extendible to new kinds of visualization.

 Tag@Map: A Web-Based Application for Visually Analyzing Geographic Information through Georeferenced Tag Clouds    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.72-81 

 In their activities of monitoring a territory and its spatio-temporal phenomena, decision makers often face problems which require rapid solutions in spite of the complexity of scenarios under investigation. Researchers from the Geographic Information domain support their activities by providing them with highly interactive visualization tools able both to synthesize information from large datasets and perform complex analytical tasks. The goal of this paper is to present a Web-based application for on-line GeoVisual Analytics which exploits the visualization capability of the Tag Cloud technique, the interaction ability of visual environments, and the Web-based data querying and accessing. The application elaborates an interactive simplified map containing a georeferenced cloud of tags, placed where the associated information is appropriate and significant. By applying semantic and geographic operators on the map tags, users are allowed to acquire information about the underlying data, useful for a better comprehension of the described phenomena. A system prototype has been realized which builds an overview of data distribution and classification expressed as a georeferenced tag cloud. It also allows users to navigate and analyze maps through zooming and filtering operations defined in agreement with Visual Analytics guidelines.   

 Clustering User Trajectories to Find Patterns for Social Interaction Applications    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.82-97 

 Sharing of user data has substantially increased over the past few years facilitated by sophisticated Web and mobile applications, including social networks. For instance, users can easily register their trajectories over time based on their daily trips captured with GPS receivers as well as share and relate them with trajectories of other users. Analyzing user trajectories over time can reveal habits and preferences. This information can be used to recommend content to single users or to group users together based on similar trajectories and/or preferences. Recording GPS tracks generates very large amounts of data. Therefore clustering algorithms are required to efficiently analyze such data. In this paper, we focus on investigating ways of efficiently analyzing user trajectories and extracting user preferences from them. We demonstrate an algorithm for clustering user GPS trajectories. In addition, we propose an algorithm to correlate trajectories based on near points between two or more users. The obtained results provided interesting avenues for exploring Location-based Social Network (LBSN) applications.   

 Making a Pictorial and Verbal Travel Trace from a GPS Trace    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.98-115 

 This paper presents a system for making a pictorial and verbal representation of a travel trace from a GPS trace with the following functions: (1) A function to make a travel trace consisting of following paths and off-road paths, which indicate the turns and the reached districts. (2) A function that generates a partonomic tree that contains the sections of the travel trace, i.e. portions of the paths of the travel trace associated with verbal information, such as toponyms, route names, and district names. (3) A function that generates clickable labels that represent the sections of a travel trace in a map view. By using the labels, users can obtain detailed information while using a small map scale, understand the part-of relations among the administrative regions represented, and intuitively navigate the representation based on the verbalized sections. We have developed a prototype of the proposed system for a web-based interactive map service, which receives either a KML or a GPX file with a GPS trace, and provides a pictorial and verbal travel trace representation on a focus+glue+context map developed in our previous work. Using the prototype, we have confirmed the feasibility of the proposed system.   

 Event Processing and Real-Time Monitoring over Streaming Traffic Data    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.116-133 

 Tracking mobility of humans, animals or merchandise has recently given rise to a wide variety of location-based services and monitoring applications. In this paper, we particularly focus on real-time traffic surveillance over densely congested road networks in large metropolitan areas. In such a setting, streaming positional updates are being frequently relayed into a central server from numerous moving vehicles (buses, taxis, passenger cars etc.). Our analysis concerns two important aspects. First, we outline characteristics of a robust processing engine that is capable to efficiently manage such massive, transient, and perhaps noisy geospatial data. Our objective is to provide online aggregates and reliable estimates regarding the current traffic situation at multiple levels of resolution. At a second step, we design a framework for effective multi-modal dissemination of derived information to the end users, in the form of interactive maps for intuitive visualization as well as instant notifications via message feeds. As a proof of concept, we also report on our ongoing development of EPOPS; in its current version, this functional prototype of the proposed scheme is able to deliver cross-platform geographic, textual, and even multimedia content through web and smartphone interfaces.   

 A Context-Aware Web Content Generator Based on Personal Tracking    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 Context-awareness has been successfully included in the mobile phone applications due mainly to the presence of numerous sensors and the access to several communication networks. Therefore, we present a Context-Aware Web Content Generator Based on Personal Tracking, which uses the user context information obtained by mobile devices to generate content for a large number of web applications. While registering the trajectory followed by the mobile device, it allows users to create multimedia documents (e.g. photo, audio, video), which are connected to an enriched description of the user context (e.g. weather, location, date). Finally, all this data and documents are combined to produce a new content, which is published on the Web. We also show results of tests performed in a real scenario and describe our strategy to avoid battery overconsumption and memory overflow in mobile phones. Moreover, a user evaluation is presented in order to measure the system performance, in terms of precision and system overall usability.   

 A Holistic Semantic Similarity Measure for Viewports in Interactive Maps    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 In recent years, geographic information has entered the main-stream, deeply altering the pre-existing patterns of its production, dis-tribution, and consumption. Through web mapping, millions of online users utilise spatial data in interactive digital maps. The typical unit of visualisation of geo-data is a viewport, defined as a bi-dimensional image of a map, fixed at a given scale, in a rectangular frame. In a viewport, the user performs analytical tasks, observing individual map features, or drawing high-level judgements about the objects in the viewport as a whole. Current geographic information retrieval (GIR) systems aim at facilitating analytical tasks, and little emphasis is put on the retrieval and indexing of visualised units, i.e. viewports. In this paper we outline a holistic, viewport-based GIR system, offering an alternative approach to feature-based GIR. Such a system indexes viewports, rather than in-dividual map features, extracting descriptors of their high-level, overall semantics in a vector space model. This approach allows for efficient comparison, classification, clustering, and indexing of viewports. A case study describes in detail how our GIR system models viewports repre-senting geographical locations in Ireland. The results indicate advantages and limitations of the viewport-based approach, which allows for a novel exploration of geographic data, using holistic semantics.   

 Recommendations Based on Region and Spatial Profiles

  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.167-184 

 Fuelled by the quantity of available online spatial data that continues to grow, the requirement for filtering spatial content to match mobile users' context becomes increasingly important. This paper introduces a flexible algorithm to derive users' preferences in a mobile and distributed system. Such preferences are implicitly computed from users' virtual and physical interactions with spatial features. Using this concept, region profiles for specific spatial contexts can be generated and used to recommend content to those visiting that region. Our approach provides a set of profiles (personal and region-based) which are combined to adapt the presentation of a given service to suit users' immediate needs and interests. A proposed college campus navigation assistant illustrates the benefits of such an unobtrusive recommender system.

  pp.185-202 

 In the framework of a geographic application displaying maps, there are several solutions for protecting a sensitive object. Sensitive objects can be hidden, masked, blurred or even replaced by fake objects. In this paper we suggest a framework to specify protection mechanisms to enforce whenever a prohibition is derived from the security policy. This framework includes (i) logical rules allowing us to derive protection mechanisms from prohibitions, and (ii) an algorithm which builds the map to display, according to the derived protection mechanisms.   

 Integrating Trend Clusters for Spatio-temporal Interpolation of Missing Sensor Data    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper

  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.203-220 

 Information acquisition in a pervasive sensor network is often affected by faults due to power outage at nodes, wrong time synchronizations, interference, network transmission failures, sensor hardware issues or excessive energy consumption for communications. These issues impose a trade-off between the precision of the measurements and the costs of communication and processing which are directly proportional to the number of sensors and/or transmissions. We present a spatio-temporal interpolation technique which allows an accurate estimation of sensor network missing data by computing the inverse distance weighting of the trend cluster representation of the transmitted data. The trend-cluster interpolation has been evaluated in a real climate sensor network in order to prove the efficacy of our solution in reducing the amount of transmissions by guaranteeing accurate estimation of missing data.   

 Discovering Sensor Services with Social Network Analysis and Expanded SQWRL Querying    
   
 Conference Paper    

 May 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 

 The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) initiative enables access of sensor data over the Web. The growing amount of available sensors requires discovering mechanisms to find sensor services relevant for users. These mechanisms must rely on explicit sensor metadata model and address the problem of semantic heterogeneity. We present a new discovering approach that is based on a novel sensor metadata model compliant with SWE standards, where sensors' descriptions are referenced to a common semantic reference frame to support resolution of semantic heterogeneities. The discovery mechanism comprises two steps: first, a network-analysis-based partitioning algorithm modularizes the set of sensors into meaningful sensor clusters, which semantics is generated with aggregation operators. Secondly, an expanded SQWRL rule-based inference engine processes the queries over the sensor clusters and issues the relevant sensor services. This approach allows users to find the sensor services relevant to their needs.   

 Leveraging Power of Transmission for Range-Free Localization of Tiny Sensors    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Apr 2012 
  Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems 
  pp.239-256 

 Modern environmental monitoring systems are being envisioned as constellations of tiny smart sensors, densely deployed on the territory to be monitored. Data provided by such sensors is meaningless if it is not equipped with information about the context to which it refers. Such a context is mainly related to the location of sensors, which allows to manage collected data by means of Geographic Information Systems. Due to scarce resources of tiny sensors characteristics, localization services are usually range-free and based on simple measurements provided by the majority of radio chips, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). However, existing solutions suffer of inaccuracy issues, due to the unreliability of the adopted indicators. This article proposes a range-free localization algorithm based on data fusion, which combines the RSSI with the Power of Transmission (PoT), by estimating the RSSI at different PoT levels. We show, through experimentation on real tiny devices, how this simple solution allows reducing the localization error to about 16% with respect to state-of-art algorithms.

 The systematic design of wireless indoor positioning systems can offer another essential approach to achieving the required performance objectives aside from using suitable location determination algorithms. This manuscript investigates Bluetooth Low Energy- (BLE-) based wireless indoor positioning systems and how adjusting the system design parameters can affect their location determination performance. Without placing emphasis on sophisticated location determination algorithms, this work provides guidelines for how a system designer can control the balance among multiple positioning performance metrics. For example, a balance between the number of installed reference nodes and the accuracy performance can be chosen to control deployment costs, such as the installation expense, infrastructure expense, and installation time. To demonstrate our baseline study, we compare three different designs of BLE wireless indoor positioning system that utilize location determination algorithms based on proximity, trilateration, and scene analysis. These designs are also compared over two different building sizes, which are medium and large. The design model and performance analysis data were based on our actual implementation of the hardware and software system for a BLE wireless indoor positioning system. Specifically, the received signal strength indication data were collected from our prototype reference nodes. The findings from our study indicated that a proximity-based system can only provide fair location accuracy performance (average error distance of 5 m to 7 m) making it unsuitable for applications that require high accuracy. For medium location accuracy performance (average error distance of 3 m to 5 m), the trilateration-based system can achieve the highest efficiency in terms of number of installed reference nodes over the accuracy. The trilateration-based system can reduce the number of installed reference nodes by 154% to achieve the same level of accuracy as the scene analysis-based system. For good location accuracy performance (average error distance ≤ 3 m), the scene analysis-based system yields the highest scalability performance in terms of installed reference nodes. The scene analysis-based system can reduce the number of reference nodes by 40% and 113% to achieve the same accuracy performance when compared with trilateration and proximity-based systems, respectively. Finally, the validation results from the actual installation of Bluetooth-based indoor positioning systems confirmed that our proposed framework can help the system designers to achieve the required performance goal. 1. Introduction The successful utilization of wireless indoor positioning systems (IPSs) has been attested in smart manufacturing or Industry 4.0 in recent years [1]. The development and implementation of many other interesting indoor location-based applications, such as in healthcare, building management, and disaster preparedness, are expected to increase the global IPS market size significantly from USD 6.1 billion in 2020 to USD 17.0 billion by 2025 [2]. Indoor localization technologies based on Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), ZigBee, Ultra-WideBand (UWB), Visible Light Communication (VLC), and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are examples of wireless IPSs that exploit wireless communication technologies to solve the indoor localization infrastructure problem. These technologies were introduced in response to the lack of reference signals, which are an essential part of the positioning infrastructure, available from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The main reason for this shortcoming is that the GNSS signal cannot penetrate well inside buildings [3]. Many researchers have worked on improving the IPSs using various location determination algorithms to achieve the goal of greater location accuracy [4, 5]. However, designing an IPS infrastructure that considers the accuracy performance requirements as a major design objective can represent another approach to be investigated by researchers. There are two basic approaches that have been used to design wireless IPSs: the existing infrastructure design approach and the new installation design approach [3]. The first approach involves using the existing wireless network infrastructure to estimate a target location. The advantage of this approach is that it eliminates expense and the need to develop a special network infrastructure. This results in a less time-consuming design, which is the first process for deploying IPSs [5]. Examples of existing researches that focus on the development of IPSs using the existing infrastructure design approach are in [6, 7]. The authors of [6] presented the development of IPSs based on WLAN fingerprinting, which can solve the problem of missing access points (APs) inside AP-dense shopping malls. The authors exploited the existing IEEE 802.11 b standard WLAN infrastructure in a large venue, which had 1,734 APs installed. In another study, the authors of [7] proposed an indoor positioning solution based on the available WLAN infrastructure in public indoor spaces such as airports. Their system aimed to provide a standalone indoor positioning service that operated with 220 different service set identifiers (SSIDs) emitted from APs. However, this type of design approach requires an intelligent positioning algorithm in order to compensate for the lack of sufficient positioning infrastructure. More precisely, the existing infrastructure cannot achieve an acceptable radio signal requirement for the IPSs, such as minimum received signal strength (RSS) from the APs. The main reason why the existing wireless communication infrastructure such as WLAN cannot support the location determination performance goal for the IPSs is that it was originally designed only for data communication purpose. In other words, the network was designed to satisfy the data rate or the user’s capacity requirements with minimum interference among APs [3]. Therefore, adjusting the number of existing APs or relocating them to improve the IPS’s performance can lead to major changes or degradations in the network performance of existing telecommunications networks, such as by reducing the quality of service, capacity, and coverage [4]. For the second design approach, a new installation design can be developed to improve location determination performance, and the system designer could have more flexible control over both communication and positioning systems. For instance, the density of wireless APs used as communication or reference nodes (RNs) for positioning can be efficiently determined by applying various optimal node placement designs for the IPSs [3]. In [8], the aim of the indoor positioning applications was to determine whether the object was inside or outside a room; therefore, the RNs could be deployed with low density. In related literature, many IPSs have been designed to accommodate new hardware installation for their positioning infrastructure. The authors of [9] proposed an indoor positioning system based on Bluetooth technology. A total of 56 Bluetooth nodes were installed inside a shopping mall to capture a variety of relevant metrics related to consumer behavior, such as shopping duration per visit. In [10], the authors presented an optimizing sensor placement approach for indoor localization in an ambient assisted-living environment called Smart-Condo. Their work focused on how to achieve the maximum coverage of the sensing field in the living room through optimal sensor placement. The goal of their IPS was to track the location and movement of individuals within their living spaces, such as if the presence in the bathroom correlated to personal hygiene activities. These examples of design approaches take advantage of new infrastructure installation that allows more efficiency and flexibility in the delivery of location-based services. In the recent literature, works related to the IPS design problem that concentrate on RN placement problems either focus on enhancing the efficiency of the system design approach or investigate the impacts of RN placement [11–15]. These existing works propose different system design solutions to meet their required localization goals. In terms of system design, a number of positioning performance metrics have been taken into account, such as improving system robustness [11], maximizing radio signal coverage [12], reducing the effect of noise and interference [13], minimizing estimating error [14], and addressing similar location fingerprint information [15]. However, a design objective in terms of what the required number of RNs should be and their optimum locations for achieving a target positioning performance goal under different indoor positioning algorithms has not yet been investigated in the existing works. Based on these knowledge gaps, how to balance a sufficient number of installed RNs and achieve location accuracy to meet the required performance goals for different indoor positioning applications is still an open research problem in the current literature. Due to the number of technology, technique, and algorithm combinations for IPSs, seeking to provide the exact design analysis for the stated problem is no trivial matter. Therefore, this work selects the example of an indoor positioning system based on Bluetooth Low Energy [16] technology since we have already developed and deployed a prototype of this system in our own research center. This wireless technology is intended for short-range wireless transmission with low energy consumption and low cost [16, 17]. However, our design approach is a framework that could be applicable to other IPSs as well. The results of our design analysis are in the form of an approximation chart which can be considered as the recommended baseline for finding performance design points. The system designer can use the chart to strike a balance between accuracy, the number of RNs, the fingerprint granularity, suitable application, and the dimensions of the service area. The design analysis in this work is based on three different groups of indoor positioning algorithms, which are proximity, trilateration, and scene analysis. Note that the proposed Robust-Maximum Summation of Max RSSI (R-MSMR) developed previously [11] is used in this work to design the wireless IPS infrastructure. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we explain our prototype Bluetooth Low Energy-based indoor positioning system used in this work. Then in Section 3, we describe our proposed framework for creating a recommended baseline for designing IPSs. Section 4 details the experimental environment and the setup parameters used in this work, while the experimental results are reported and discussed in Section 5. The developed design baseline is validated with the actual implementation of an indoor positioning system in our research facility. Finally, the conclusion and discussion of our proposed framework and future work are presented in Section 6. 2. Indoor Positioning Using Bluetooth Low Energy Bluetooth technology has been primarily developed for short-range wireless transmission with low power consumption and low cost [16, 17]. Then starting with the release of the Bluetooth 4.0 specification [17] in 2010, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an attractive wireless technology that can be applied to indoor positioning systems. Over the subsequent years, BLE has been applied for location-based services, ranging from proximity detection to positioning in real-time location system (RTLS) [18]. Moreover, the BLE technology is readily available on almost all portable devices such as smartphones and electronic development kits [4]. The widespread adoption of BLE technology such as Bluetooth beacons [19] allows end users to enjoy easy access to many important features of IPSs such as navigation and tracking services. Thus, this current research adopts the BLE technology and takes the new installation design approach to investigate how the systematic design of an IPS can be applied to achieve a required performance objective for different indoor location-based applications. Figure 1 illustrates the system architecture of our BLE-based indoor positioning system. In this work, the developed IPS is a real-time location system in which Bluetooth tags (attached to objects or held by users) are tracked for their location inside an area with Bluetooth locators. Note that the Bluetooth tag is equivalent to the target node, while the Bluetooth locator is referred to as the reference node (RN) in this work. The four main components of our system consist of target nodes, reference nodes (RNs), a communication network, and a processing unit. The first component is the target node, such as a BLE tag. It is an active RFID card that can continuously broadcast a BLE’s beacon signal as a BLE message. The BLE messages (with their tag ID) or beacons are typically transmitted periodically over a short duration. The interval between beacon transmissions can be set anywhere between 100 milliseconds and up to five seconds. Figure 2(a) illustrates a target node used in this work. It is a common off-the-shelf (COTS) Bluetooth beacon card from Minew Tech [20]. The dimensions of the device are approximately 90 mm × 60 mm × 4 mm. We can configure this BLE tag’s beacon broadcast interval and transmit power via any mobile phone with a Bluetooth interface. The BLE tag is based on an nRF52 series chipset from Nordic Semiconductor [21]. Note that the broadcasting interval of the BLE tag was set to one second in our system. The transmit power and typical receiver sensitivity for the BLE tag (target node) were set to +0 dBm and −93 dBm, respectively. With these settings and specifications, the range of these BLE transceivers for indoor use with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) is approximately 25 meters based on our experiment.

 Evaluation of reliability is very important entity for the design and operation of systems. The safety, dependability, availability, Mean Time To Failure (MTTF), Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) and life cycle of the designed system can be judged from this reliability evaluation. For simple systems, the evaluation is straightforward. However, for complex systems, an algorithmic procedure is required. This paper presents an algorithmic procedure based on information matrices derived from graph theoretic approach. A simulation tool is developed that applies the algorithm to evaluate the reliability of complex systems.

 The increasing availability of sensor devices has resulted in important volumes of sensor data, which has raised the issue of making these data fully discoverable andinterpretable by applications and end-users. The idea of OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) has addressed this issue by proposing a set of standards to enable accessibility ofsensor data over the Web. Similarly, there is a growing interest in volunteered geographic information (VGI). Considering that several researchers have highlighted the potential ofthis new type of information as a complement to existing, "traditional" data, it becomes important to develop frameworks to support the integration of VGI from several sourcesand with other types of data. In this paper, we make a first step in this direction by proposing a framework for the semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI. Afterhaving performed an investigation of the types of VGI applications, we have developed a conceptual model of VGI aligned with relevant ISO standards for describing geospatialfeatures. The purpose of this model is to support the generation of common descriptions for VGI applications, which will act as interfaces to higher-level services, such as discoveryand reasoning services, in order to be exploited in conjunction with sensor data by client applications. This process is described through architecture for semantic interoperability ofsensor data and VGI that we have developed and that we intend to use to set guidelines for future research on integration of VGI in sensor data cyberinfrastructures. We illustrate the possibilities created by the proposed framework with a description of the various servicesand interfaces required to implement the framework.

  The fields of Wearable Computing, Augmented Reality and Ubiquitous Computing are in principle highly conver- gent, as they all promise a utopian future in which the de- vices embedded in the environment, our bodies and our clothes will have reached a level integration such that we can intuitively perceive and interact with our environment. However, the reality as practised in research labs and ... [Show full abstract]  lim- ited commercial deployments has been that budgetary and technical constraints have actually kept these fields sepa- rate and distinct. One manifestation of this separation is in the choice of sensors used to build systems in each do- main. A truly cross-disciplinary project has to incorporate sensors of much greater heterogeneity than has occurred heretofore. The way in which sensors are deployed results in spatial seams that can act as obstacles to the provision of services across different areas. This paper takes an archi- tectural approach to handling events from different tracking systems and maintaining a consistent spatial model of peo- ple and objects. The principal distinguishing feature is the automatic derivation of dataflow network of distributed sen- sors, dynamically and at run-time, based on requirements expressed by clients.

  This paper proposes a new application framework to adopt mobile augmented reality in indoor localization and navigation. We observe that there are two constraints in existing positioning systems. First, the signal drifting problem may mistake the positioning results but most of positioning systems do not adopt user feedback information to help correct these positioning errors. Second, traditional ... [Show full abstract]  positioning systems usually consider a two-dimensional environment but an indoor building should be treated as a three-dimensional environment. To release the above constraints, our framework allows users to interact with the positioning system by the multi-touch screen and IMU sensors equipped in the mobile devices. In particular, the multi-touch screen allows users to identify their requirements while the IMU sensors will feedback users' moving behaviors such as their moving directions to help correct positioning errors. Besides, with the cameras equipped in the mobile devices, we can realize the mobile augmented reality to help navigate users in a more complex indoor environment and provide more interactive location-based service. A prototype system is also developed to verify the practicability of our application framework.

  In this work, we investigated the benefit of head gestures as a user interface to control hearing instruments (HIs). We developed a prototype of a head-gesture-controlled HI, which was based on a customised wireless acceleration sensor for unconstrained and continuous real-time monitoring of the user's head movements. We evaluated the system from a technical point of view and achieved a precision ... [Show full abstract]  of 96% and a recall of 97% for spotting the two head gestures used: tilting the head to the left and right side. We further evaluated the system from the user's point of view based on the feedback from 6 hearing-impaired HI users (4 men, 2 women, age 27-60).We compared our head-gesture-based control to existing HI user interfaces: HI-integrated buttons and HI remote control. We found that the benefit of the different HI interaction solutions depends on the user's current situations and that all participating HI users would appreciate head gesture control as an additional, complementing user interface.

  The rapid increase of mobile device usage across all organisational and social levels has sparked the development of pervasive solutions for the improvement of many daily processes. Recent advances in ubiquitous computing offer new opportunities, with the promise of providing a better modeling of the mobility, collaboration and context-awareness of the different actors involved. With increasing ... [Show full abstract]  communication capabilities such as Infrared, Bluetooth or W-LAN, mobile devices allow new and interesting ways to achieve collaboration among their users. Moreover, the increasing number of sensor networks and sensing devices allows the design of new types of technologies that combine these new capabilities in order to form pervasive solutions. This paper addresses the design and implementation of a mobile, context-aware human resource scheduling application that is distributed over several mobile devices using wireless technologies. Each instance of the application uses the concept of a trail, which is a collection of locations together with associated information. Activities to be performed by users are aggregated by the application and dispatched to users' trails based on the current context. This concept creates a collaborative environment that enables efficient resource scheduling across multiple users, providing location-based services using ubiquitous technologies.

  The Ambient Intelligence paradigm is built upon Ubiquitous Computing (UC), in which the computing devices are embedded in the environment with the purpose of enhancing the human experience at home, workplace/office, learning, health care etc. The UC applications aim at providing services to the users anywhere, anytime in an unobtrusive, seemingly invisible way. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) ... [Show full abstract]  have great potential for UC applications and are envisioned to revolutionize them. However, before WSNs become a commodity, several issues remain to be resolved. Among the major concerns of designing WSN for UC applications is the design of efficient energy-aware routing protocols. A large number of routing protocols has been proposed in the literature. They basically differ depending on the application and network architecture used in their design. In this paper, we present clustering energy-aware routing protocols for WSNs and highlight their features.

However, most of existing context-aware systems have extremely tight coupling between applications' semantic and sensor's details. So, the objective of our research is to implement an approach which can support the ability to reuse sensors and to evolve existing applications to use new context types. In this paper, we illustrate our approach for proactive intelligent assistance and we describe our architecture based on three principal layers. These layers are designed in order to build applications which can increase the welfare of the user situated in intelligent environment.

 The 18th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS International Conference on Virtual Execution Environments (VEE’22) brings together researchers in the broad area of virtualization. This area includes topics such as compiler-based virtual machines (JVM, CLR, LLVM, etc.), operating system abstractions for virtualization (processes, containers), hardware accelerated system virtual machines (paravirtualization, hypervisors), translators, machine emulators, and simulators. Although these layers have different design and implementation techniques, the fundamental challenges and insights tend to be similar. We invite authors to submit original papers related to virtualization across all layers of the software stack down to the microarchitectural level. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): architecture support for virtualization; compiler and programming language support for virtualization; managed runtimes and virtual machines; management technologies for virtual environments; memory management; operating system support for virtualization; performance analysis and debugging for virtual environments; runtime system support for virtualization; security and virtual environments, including TEE-based VMs; virtual and kernel-bypass I/O, storage, and networking; virtualization and runtime systems for mobile devices and smart devices virtualization in cloud computing, including containers or serverless; virtualization reliability; virtualization support for programs and programmers; virtualization technologies applied to specific problem domains such as HPC, realtime, and power management.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The 18th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS International Conference on Virtual Execution Environments (VEE’22) brings together researchers in the broad area of virtualization. This area includes topics such as compiler-based virtual machines (JVM, CLR, LLVM, etc.), operating system abstractions for virtualization (processes, containers), hardware accelerated system virtual machines (paravirtualization, hypervisors), translators, machine emulators, and simulators. Although these layers have different design and implementation techniques, the fundamental challenges and insights tend to be similar.  
 We invite authors to submit original papers related to virtualization across all layers of the software stack down to the microarchitectural level. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 architecture support for virtualization; 
  compiler and programming language support for virtualization; 
  managed runtimes and virtual machines; 
  management technologies for virtual environments; 
  memory management; 
  operating system support for virtualization; 
  performance analysis and debugging for virtual environments; 
  runtime system support for virtualization; 
  security and virtual environments, including TEE-based VMs; 
  virtual and kernel-bypass I/O, storage, and networking; 
  virtualization and runtime systems for mobile devices and smart devices 
  virtualization in cloud computing, including containers or serverless; 
  virtualization reliability; 
  virtualization support for programs and programmers; 
  virtualization technologies applied to specific problem domains such as HPC, realtime, and power management. 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Please submit your paper through https://vee22.hotcrp.com/  after reading the following submission instructions.  
 VEE’22 accepts both full-length and short papers. Both types of submissions are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in the scope of the ideas expressed. The program committee will not accept a full paper on the condition that it is cut down to fit in a short paper slot, nor will it invite short papers to be extended to full length. Submissions will be considered only in the category in which they are submitted.  
 An ideal short paper would express an idea that doesn’t require as many pages to describe or evaluate. The ideas should be well formed and complete just like those in a full-length paper. A short paper should not be a HotOS / HotStorage-style workshop paper with an interesting idea that isn’t yet fully developed. Short papers will be held to the same standard as full-length papers in terms of clarity of presentation and evaluation, however, the scope of the work as well as the breadth of the evaluation is expected to be smaller.  
 Submissions must attack an interesting problem and clearly articulate their contribution relative to previous work. Submissions must be in ACM SIGPLAN proceedings format, 10-point type on 11-point leading, 7x9 inch text block, and two columns with .33 inch column separation, and submissions may not exceed 12 pages for full papers and 6 pages for short papers, excluding references. LaTeX templates for this format are available at https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/  (but please note that 10-point is not the default).  
 Note that ACM’s new camera-ready system only supports a subset of LaTeX packages. The approved list is at https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/accepted-latex-packages  . Pages must be numbered, and submissions must be in PDF, legible when printed black and white on US Letter and A4 paper. All fonts must be embedded in the submitted PDF. Submissions violating the formatting guidelines may be rejected without review.  
 Reviewing will be double blind, therefore submissions must be anonymous. Author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, and any other hints of identity must not be included in the submission. You should not anonymize your bibliographic references; instead, cite your work in the third person so that your submission is self-contained. Make a good-faith effort to conceal any authorship connection between prior work and yours.  
 Submissions must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed at https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication  . Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release. The proceedings will be published by ACM.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE  : The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please send email to the program chairs.

 WABI   
  
  Wonderful Algorithms in Bioinformatics   

 The annual WABI conference* brings together researchers from all over the world working on the algorithmic aspects of computational biology for 3 days of contributed papers, invited talks, and poster sessions.   
 WABI was started in 2001 by Bernard Moret and Tandy Warnow at the invitation of Erik Meineche Schmidt, the organizer of the first ALGO meeting. It has been held every year since, in Europe (in conjunction with ALGO) and North America. WABI proceedings are published in established series (  Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science   from 2001 to 2016 and the  Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics   since 2017) and each year a selection of papers are invited for publication in  Algorithms for Molecular Biology   .   
  
  WABI steering committee:  Vincent Moulton (U. East Anglia, UK),  Nadia Pisanti (U. Pisa, Italy), Mona Singh (Princeton U., USA), and  Jens Stoye (Bielefeld U., Germany)  .   
  
  WABI is held in even years in Europe, in conjunction with ALGO, and, since 2015, in odd years in North America, in conjunction with ACM-BCB.   
 WABI 2025 will be held at the University of Maryland, College Park, MA, USA. A web site will be set up soon.

 *WABI started in 2001 as the "Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics", but since it soon developed into a typical conference format, we are now not using the term "Workshop" any more. We believe "Wonderful" is a highly suitable alternative.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The 18th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS International Conference on Virtual Execution Environments (VEE’22) brings together researchers in the broad area of virtualization. This area includes topics such as compiler-based virtual machines (JVM, CLR, LLVM, etc.), operating system abstractions for virtualization (processes, containers), hardware accelerated system virtual machines (paravirtualization, hypervisors), translators, machine emulators, and simulators. Although these layers have different design and implementation techniques, the fundamental challenges and insights tend to be similar.  
 We invite authors to submit original papers related to virtualization across all layers of the software stack down to the microarchitectural level. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
 architecture support for virtualization; 
  compiler and programming language support for virtualization; 
  managed runtimes and virtual machines; 
  management technologies for virtual environments; 
  memory management; 
  operating system support for virtualization; 
  performance analysis and debugging for virtual environments; 
  runtime system support for virtualization; 
  security and virtual environments, including TEE-based VMs; 
  virtual and kernel-bypass I/O, storage, and networking; 
  virtualization and runtime systems for mobile devices and smart devices 
  virtualization in cloud computing, including containers or serverless; 
  virtualization reliability; 
  virtualization support for programs and programmers; 
  virtualization technologies applied to specific problem domains such as HPC, realtime, and power management. 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Please submit your paper through https://vee22.hotcrp.com/  after reading the following submission instructions.  
 VEE’22 accepts both full-length and short papers. Both types of submissions are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in the scope of the ideas expressed. The program committee will not accept a full paper on the condition that it is cut down to fit in a short paper slot, nor will it invite short papers to be extended to full length. Submissions will be considered only in the category in which they are submitted.  
 An ideal short paper would express an idea that doesn’t require as many pages to describe or evaluate. The ideas should be well formed and complete just like those in a full-length paper. A short paper should not be a HotOS / HotStorage-style workshop paper with an interesting idea that isn’t yet fully developed. Short papers will be held to the same standard as full-length papers in terms of clarity of presentation and evaluation, however, the scope of the work as well as the breadth of the evaluation is expected to be smaller.  
 Submissions must attack an interesting problem and clearly articulate their contribution relative to previous work. Submissions must be in ACM SIGPLAN proceedings format, 10-point type on 11-point leading, 7x9 inch text block, and two columns with .33 inch column separation, and submissions may not exceed 12 pages for full papers and 6 pages for short papers, excluding references. LaTeX templates for this format are available at https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/  (but please note that 10-point is not the default).  
 Note that ACM’s new camera-ready system only supports a subset of LaTeX packages. The approved list is at https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/accepted-latex-packages  . Pages must be numbered, and submissions must be in PDF, legible when printed black and white on US Letter and A4 paper. All fonts must be embedded in the submitted PDF. Submissions violating the formatting guidelines may be rejected without review.  
 Reviewing will be double blind, therefore submissions must be anonymous. Author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, and any other hints of identity must not be included in the submission. You should not anonymize your bibliographic references; instead, cite your work in the third person so that your submission is self-contained. Make a good-faith effort to conceal any authorship connection between prior work and yours.  
 Submissions must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed at https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication  . Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release. The proceedings will be published by ACM.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE  : The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please send email to the program chairs.

 WABI 2024  
   
 Scope  
 WABI is an international Conference covering research in algorithmic  work in bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology. The emphasis is mainly on discrete algorithms and machine learning methods that address important problems in molecular biology, that are founded on sound models, that are computationally efficient, and that provide evidence of their potential usefulness in practice, preferably by testing on appropriately chosen simulated or real datasets. The goal is to present recent research results, including significant work-in-progress, and to identify and explore directions of future research. This year it is co-located with ALGO 2024.  
 Important Dates  
  
 Paper submission deadline: May 26  (Anywhere on Earth) 
  Notifications: June 30 
  Camera-ready versions: July 08 
  Invitations to authors of selected papers for the WABI 2024 series in Algorithms for Molecular Biology (AMB)  : July 22 
  Conference: | Sep 2 – Sep 4

 Keynote Speaker  
   Tomás Vinar  , Comenius University  
 Title  : Bioinformatics of Pathogens  
 Abstract  : Genomic sequencing has become an important tool in identification and surveillance of human pathogens. Compared to large organisms, where our goal is to obtain high-quality sequences for detailed analysis, in pathogen sequencing the emphasis is often on optimization of cost and time. Consequently, sequencing of pathogens creates interesting computational challenges and development of new methods has a potential to significantly enhance applicability of the results in epidemiology and clinical practice. In my talk, I will give two examples: plasmid identification in bacterial isolates and genomic surveillance of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2. In both cases, application of better algorithms and modeling helps to improve the quality of analysis of very noisy data.  
  
 Invited Speaker  
   Giulia  Bernardini  , University of Trieste  
 Title  : Solving phylogenetic problems through graph theory: two case studies  
 Abstract  : In this talk, I will showcase two problems arising in Phylogenetics that get efficient solutions via reductions to well-studied problems on bipartite graphs. First, I will introduce the incomplete directed perfect phylogeny problem, asking to complete missing entries in a species-characters binary matrix so as to reconstruct a directed perfect phylogeny. I will demonstrate how this problem can be solved in linear time by designing a specialized dynamic connectivity data structure on bipartite graphs. The second problem asks to compute the permutation distance between two isomorphic, fully labelled phylogenetic trees. I will show how this task can be reduced to computing the largest cardinality matching in a sparse bipartite graph to obtain an efficient solution.

 Affiliation  Associate Professor, Department of Applied Mathematics, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Waseda University    Degree  M.D.(Mar, 2017)   
 Ph.D.(Mar, 2010)   
    Researcher number    00785727  ORCID iD   https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8825-6331   J-GLOBAL ID  201601012618715282   researchmap Member ID  7000018742    External link  https://www.youtube.com/c/hayamizu-lab    
    I went to medical school with the intention of becoming a researcher in basic medicine and worked as a clinician for several years after graduation. However, I ended up becoming an applied mathematician because I was keenly aware of the importance of methods for extracting information from data since my student days, and I wanted to contribute to medicine through theoretical research on methods for analysing biological data.  
 My research is therefore related to mathematical science, information science, statistical science and life science, but my specialisation is in discrete mathematics (combinatorics, graph theory, discrete geometry, discrete algorithms), which deals with problems related to graphs and networks. I believe that my strength and originality lie in formulating important biological problems into mathematical problems and creating new theorems and algorithms to solve them.  
 I am currently particularly interested in the mathematical and computational aspects of phylogenetic trees and networks and their applications. Studying them can help elucidate many important biological processes, such as cell differentiation and bacterial or viral evolution.  
 I am also active in education and outreach activities. For more information, please visit my laboratory's YouTube channel  .

 17th Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium & 33rd Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry  
 August 9, 2021  - August 12, 2021   
   
 «  AARMS CRG Online Workshop on Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Science 
  AARMS COVID-19 Seminar: Jane Heffernan (York) » 

 This event consists of two co-located conferences over a four-day period. These two conferences are the 17th Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS) and the 33rd Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry (CCCG).  
 WADS is intended as a forum for researchers in the area of design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. We invite submissions of papers presenting original research on the theory and application of algorithms and data structures in all areas, including combinatorics, computational geometry, databases, graphics, and parallel and distributed computing.  
 CCCG is a forum to disseminate and discuss new theoretical and applied results in discrete and computational geometry. It focuses on the design of efficient algorithms, the development of software, and the study of the mathematical foundations of computational problems whose formulations involve geometric constraints. The field of computational geometry is motivated by problems from a broad range of application areas.

  About the Collection  
 Algorithms for Molecular Biology  is proud to publish the extended proceedings of WABI 2024  .  
 WABI is an international Conference covering research in algorithmic work in bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology. The emphasis is mainly on discrete algorithms and machine learning methods that address important problems in molecular biology, that are founded on sound models, that are computationally efficient, and that provide evidence of their potential usefulness in practice, preferably by testing on appropriately chosen simulated or real datasets. The goal is to present recent research results, including significant work-in-progress, and to identify and explore directions of future research. This year it is co-located with ALGO 2024.  

 There are currently no articles in this collection.

 WAOA 2024  
   
 Scope  
 Approximation and online algorithms are fundamental tools to deal with computationally hard problems and problems in which the input is gradually disclosed over time. Both kinds of problems arise from a large number of applications in a variety of fields. The Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms (WAOA)  focuses on the design and analysis of approximation and online algorithms. It also covers experimental methods used to design and analyze efficient approximation and online algorithms.  
 WAOA 2024 is co-located with ALGO 2024  , which also hosts ESA  , ALGOCLOUD  , ALGOWIN  , ATMOS  , IPEC  , and WABI  . ALGO 2024 will take place at Royal Holloway, University of London  in Egham, United Kingdom.

  Title: | Advances in Approximation Algorithms for Tree and Connectivity Augmentation 
  Abstract: | Augmentation problems are a fundamental class of Network Design problems. The goal is to find a cheapest way to increase a graph’s (edge-)connectivity by adding edges from a given set of options. The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem is one of its most elementary examples, which can be interpreted as determining a cheapest way to increase the edge-connectivity of a graph from 0 to 1. The next step, to increase from 1 to 2, leads to the heavily studied Tree Augmentation Problem, and the more general problem of increasing the edge-connectivity by 1 of an arbitrary graph is known as Connectivity Augmentation. While these problems admit simple 2-approximations, obtaining approximation factors below 2 has proven challenging. This talk has several goals, namely: | Providing a brief introduction to Tree and Connectivity Augmentation. 
  Discussing relevant algorithmic techniques that have recently led to better-than-2 approximations for these problems, including the Relative Greedy method and an interesting connection of it to local search procedures. 
  Demonstrating how these techniques can be leveraged to obtain better-than-2 approximations for (weighted) augmentation problems.

 Submission guidelines  
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper of at most 10 pages excluding the title page, references, and an optional appendix. The submission should be typeset using a 10-point or larger font in a single-column format with ample spacing throughout and 2cm margins all around on A4-size paper. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in an appendix. This appendix can even comprise an entire full version of the paper. The appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.  
 Results previously published (or scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal will not be accepted at WAOA. Simultaneous submission to journals or other conferences with published proceedings is not permitted. By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance at least one of the authors must register at ALGO 2024, attend the conference onsite and present the paper. The program committee may award a Best Paper Award to one of the accepted papers.  
 Double-blind reviewing  
 The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
 COI with PC members  
 When submitting a paper, authors will be asked to indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  PC member owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent or recent collaborator (within last 5 years) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
    
 PC Submissions  
 Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed, but will be subject to a stricter review process.  
 Paper Submission and Proceedings  
 Papers should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system  . The WAOA 2024 proceedings  will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)  . Selected papers presented at WAOA 2024 will be invited to a special issue of Theory of Computing Systems  .

 Introduction  
   
 The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) is a biannual multi-disciplinary single-track meeting of international researchers presenting the latest advances on algorithmic problems in robotics. WAFR was created in 1994 as a small-size workshop. It has been held since 1994 and while it spans a relatively small community, it has an established reputation as one, if not the most, important venue for presenting algorithmic work related to robotics.  
 The focus of WAFR is on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles. These algorithms process inputs from noisy sensors, build geometric and physical models of the world, plan high-and low-level actions at different time horizons, and execute these actions on actuators with limited precision. The design and analysis of robot algorithms raise a unique combination of questions from many fields, including control theory, computational geometry and topology, geometrical and physical modeling, reasoning under uncertainty, probabilistic algorithms, game theory, machine learning, and theoretical computer science. In addition to these topics, we also encourage papers on applications of robot algorithms to important or new domains, such as manufacturing, legged locomotion, distributed robotics, human-robot interaction, surgical robots, intelligent prosthetics, and brain-controlled robots. Furthermore, we welcome papers on applications of robot algorithms in domains beyond the traditional scope of robotics, e.g., computational biology, computer animation, sensor networks. The workshop proceedings will be published in the Springer Proceedings in Advanced Robotics (SPAR) series and selected papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of the International Journal of Robotics Research.

 Overview  

 Virtually every human-technology interaction, or sensor network, generates observations that are in some relation with each other. As a result, many data science problems can be viewed as a study of some properties of complex networks in which nodes represent the entities that are being studied and edges represent relations between these entities. Such networks are often large-scale, decentralized, and evolve dynamically over time. Modeling and mining complex networks in order to understand the principles governing the organization and the behaviour of such networks is crucial for a broad range of fields of study, including information and social sciences, economics, biology, and neuroscience.  
 The aim of the 20th Workshop on Modelling and Mining Networks (WAW 2025)  is to further the understanding of networks that arise in theoretical as well as applied domains. The goal is also to stimulate the development of high-performance and scalable algorithms that exploit these networks. The workshop welcomes the researchers who are working on graph-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of networks represented as graphs or hypergraphs and other higher order structures.  
 WAW 2025  will be held at the Vilnius University  , Vilnius, Lithuania.

  Venue and Local Information  
 WAW 2025 will be held at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics  of Vilnius university  (Naugarduko str. 24, Vilnius). The venue is in the city center.  
   
  Vilnius is well connected internationally with Vilnius Airport within the city. Another option is to take a flight to Kaunas airport (100 km away from Vilnius) and to go to Vilnius by a shuttle bus  . Public transportation in Vilnius entails buses/trolleybuses network. Tickets are available at a bus driver and on the m.Ticket  app. For taxi services in Vilnius one may look at, e.g., Bolt, Etransport.  
   
  Official currency in Lithuania is Euro. Electronic payments with MasterCard and Visa are accepted in majority of shops and other points of interest.  
   
  Vilnius University was founded in 1579 by king Stephen Báthory of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth it was closed down in 1832 by Tsar Nikolas I of Russia after the November uprising. The university was reopened in 1919 and operates since then with a short break of 1943-1944, when it was closed by the Nazis. The first university campus shaped in the 16th century in an old city quarter is open for visitors.

 Author and Submission Guidelines  
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 PLEASE NOTE:  To be published in the IEEE WCNC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the FULL or LIMITED (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one FULL or LIMITED registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE WCNC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®.  
 During the initial paper submission process via EDAS, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on the  EDAS registration page. In particular, the EDAS registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all submissions must be done through EDAS.  
 IMPORTANT:  The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.  
 All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than two (2) additional printed pages (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra pages (the 7th and 8th pages) will incur an over length page charge of US$100 for each page. All final papers must be submitted to the IEEE Conference eXpress website. Please refer to the acceptance letter for the instructions on how to upload final papers.  
 You may also use one of the following templates for Microsoft Word: A4, US letter.  
 Download Standard IEEE conference templates for LaTeX formats >>   
 If you have any questions regarding the submission of manuscripts, please contact one of the Technical Program Chairs of the Symposia that you are submitting a paper.
