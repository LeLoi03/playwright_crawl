 The 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025)  , sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory ( SIGACT  ), will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from Monday, June 23  to Friday, June 27  .  
 Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas.  
 Submission format:  Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see below)  , and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the "full version" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  
   
  Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
   
  STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing  , and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work…" but rather "We build on the work of…").  
   
  The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
   
  All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.  
   
  PC Member Submissions:  Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed.  
   
  Recommended Best Practices for References:  Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages.  
   
  Authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing "\cite{XYZ} show..." instead of "X et al. show". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \bibliographystyle{alpha} or \bibliographystyle{alphaurl}.  
 Conflict of Interest Policy:  The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see here  ) and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy  . Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
  If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate  affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate.  
 Submission Instructions:  Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing).  
 The submission server  is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.   
 It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:  The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions.  
 Presentation of Accepted Papers:  One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference. Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
  
 Dates and other relevant information:  
 Paper submission deadline:  Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST. There is no separate abstract submission deadline.  
   
  Notification date:  by email on or before February 1, 2025.  
   
  Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:  A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 31, 2025. The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the ACM Format  , and specifically the sigconf option. (LaTeX users, please use: \documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}). Additional instructions will be sent directly to the authors of accepted papers.  
   
  STOC talks:  Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025.  
   
 Publication date:  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Best Paper Award:  The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible. In addition to the standard COI-avoidance, the final designation process will be conducted by the subset of PC Members with no submission to the conference. Rules for the award can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html  .  
 Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:  A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission. To inform the program committee about a paper's eligibility, check the appropriate box in the web form on the submission server. The list of past winners can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/student.html  .  
 Access to Proceedings:  The committee intends to provide registered attendees with internet access to the Proceedings on a password-protected site that will be available from about two weeks before the conference until the end of the conference. Authors can opt out of this online distribution by contacting the program committee chair by March 19, 2025.  
 Student Travel Awards:  SIGACT provides travel awards to students without available support, and researchers from developing countries. More information on the award process will be posted later on.

 STOC Best Paper Award  
 The following rules for the Best Paper Award at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing  (STOC) were developed by a committee consisting of Paul Beame, David Johnson, Prabhakar Raghavan, Eva Tardos and David Williamson (Chair). The committee developed the policy for FOCS. The same policy was adopted for STOC by the SIGACT Executive Committee, as announced in the STOC 2002 Business Meeting.  
 The Program Committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. 
  Each author on each of the selected papers will receive a certificate or plaque with the name of the award, the name of the paper, and the names of the authors of the paper, to be awarded at the Business Meeting that year. 
  The main criterion for selection is the same as for being a top-rated paper in the conference: introduction of a strong new technique, solution of a long-standing open problem, introduction and solution of an interesting and important new problem, etc. These are the characteristics associated with giving a paper the highest score. 
  Additionally, the committee should have substantial confidence in the correctness of the paper. While the committee may choose to accept papers to appear in the conference while lacking confidence that the paper is correct, such papers should not be recipients of the Best Paper Award. Since only abstracts are submitted to the conference, the committee may, after accepting a paper to the conference, inform the authors that the paper is being considered for the Award, and request additional details. It is suggested that the committee finalize its decisions on the Award in time to have the recipients listed in the proceedings of the conference. However, the committee may choose to use the time up until the conference itself to continue reviewing the papers. 
  The committee should verify that the final proceedings version of the paper meets the high promise of the submitted abstract. 
  If no paper meets the criteria above, then no award need be given. 
  If a paper qualifies for the Machtey/Lewin Best Student Paper Award, it should not be disqualified from being considered for the Best Paper Award, and vice versa; a paper meriting both Awards should be given both Awards.

 // Research Track  

 SYSTOR accepts both full-length and short papers. A short paper is intended for an idea that can be described and evaluated in fewer pages; the goal of the short paper is not for preliminary work or workshop-style position papers.   
 A good SYSTOR paper should present a novel, compelling solution to a well-motivated problem. The evaluation should demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the solution in settings that are as realistic as possible, including test applications workloads, system parameters, and assumed constraints. Authors should clearly describe their contribution in the context of prior work, and draw meaningful conclusions from their work.   
 The program committee also encourages submissions that describe lessons learned from operational (especially large-scale) system deployments. Such submissions are expected to include sufficient details of the system, its design goals, and the methods used for evaluating whether these goals were met.   
 The program committee will value submissions accompanied by supplemental material such as traces and open-source code that can help reproduce the reported results, and advance additional research in the field.   
 A small set of outstanding papers will be forwarded to a suitable journal, such as ACM journal Transactions on Storage (TOS) or Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), for a fast-tracked review process for an expanded version of the paper.   
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all  ACM Publications Policies   , including ACM’s new  Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   .   
 Accepted papers may be invited to participate also in the Israeli Systems Workshop.  

 // Posters Track  

 SYSTOR also welcomes academic and industrial posters. See “Call for Papers” above for foci and relevant areas.   
 A good poster submission will articulate and motivate an interesting problem, and describe a new insight or approach to addressing this problem. It will clearly present the work in progress (or attained results), and the expected outcomes from future work. The poster should present these details in a manner that is clear and captivating.   
 Poster submissions should include a one-page extended abstract, and a draft of the poster. The extended abstracts of accepted posters will be included in the online conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will review poster submissions in a single-blind manner.   
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all  ACM Publications Policies   , including ACM’s new  Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   .   
 Accepted posters can opt-in for physical presentation at the Israeli Systems Workshop in person.  
 Additional posters to be presented (physically) in ISW – the Israeli Systems Workshop  only, can be submitted by September 5.  
   Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to sarelco@mta.ac.il  and moshesu@mta.ac.il   

 // HIGHLIGHTS TRACK - ISRAELI SYSTEMS WORKSHOP  

 The highlights track gives an opportunity for research, published over the last year in a systems conference (e.g., SOSP, OSDI, FAST, ASPLOS, EuroSys, ATC, NSDI), to reach a broader audience with a second presentation (similar to ATC’s “Best of the Rest” track). Highlight papers will be presented in-person  at the Israeli Systems Workshop on September 25, so at least one author must physically attend the workshop.  
 Submission should include the paper abstract and details (where / when) of the previous publication. The paper will not be republished in the SYSTOR conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  

 // Submission Instructions  

 Research papers (full and short) should be submitted through: https://systor24.hotcrp.com   
 Posters should be submitted through: https://systor24posters.hotcrp.com   
 Highlight papers for the Israeli Systems Workshop should be submitted through: https://systor24highlights.hotcrp.com   
 Additional posters to be presented (physically) in ISW – the Israeli Systems Workshop  only, can be submitted by September 5.  
   Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to sarelco@mta.ac.il  and moshesu@mta.ac.il   
  
 Review Process  
 The program committee will review submissions  to the Research Track in a double-blind manner. All submissions should be properly anonymized, removing all identifiable information whenever possible including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.   
 Any submissions accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement will be returned without review  .   
 Copyright and originality of the work  
 SYSTOR will enforce  ACM’s Plagiarism policy   regarding copying and resubmission of prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to SYSTOR must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal.   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the earlier of either the first day of the conference or the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to  two weeks prior   to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   
 Formatting instructions  
 Papers should be submitted electronically as a PDF. All text and figures must fit within a 7”x9” text block, centered on the page, using two columns with .33 inches of separation. The paper should be typeset using a 10-point font (Times New Roman or similar) with a 12-point (single-spaced) leading.   
 For the Full and Short Paper Tracks, please follow  paper formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template,  is available here   .   
 For the Posters Track, please follow  poster formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template, is available here   .   
 Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please email the program chairs: Sam H. Noh and Aviad Zuck  .    
 Additional instructions regarding camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be sent directly to the corresponding authors and will appear  he  re  after the notification to authors.   
 Virtual presentation instructions  
 Please follow the video preparation and presentation instructions provided here  .  
 Arxiv  
 A paper submitted to SYSTOR can be submitted simultaneously to Arxiv, with some changes. We would like the authors to make an honest effort to preserve anonymity. Please ensure the SYSTOR submission is using a different title and a different system name from the Arxiv version. It would be useful to let the chairs know if there is an Arxiv paper so that we can intervene if PC members find it accidentally and think the submission is plagiarizing the Arxiv paper.   
 Open Source  
 The authors of a SYSTOR submission are encouraged to associate a source code repo with their submission, but this repo must be completely anonymized. It is alright if a named (= not anonymized) source code repo exists, so long as it isn’t associated/linked with the submission in any way. An anonymized repo can be a clone of the named repo which is modified to be anonymous. Another way to do this is  https://anonymous.4open.science/   .

  Call For Papers   
   
 The 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025), sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT), will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from Monday, June 23 to Friday, June 27. Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas. Submission format: Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see below), and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the "full version" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified. Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing, and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work…" but rather "We build on the work of…"). The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions. PC Member Submissions: Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed. Recommended Best Practices for References: Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages. Authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing "\cite{XYZ} show..." instead of "X et al. show". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \bibliographystyle{alpha} or \bibliographystyle{alphaurl}. Conflict of Interest Policy: The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see here) and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy. Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories: Family member or close friend. Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. Person with the same affiliation. Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate. Submission Instructions: Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing). The submission server is scheduled to open on Oct. 1, 2024. It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline. ACM is moving to require ORCIDs for all authors. An ORCID is an identifier that uniquely identifies an author. It connects an author's work even if there are variations in the names used on different papers, ensuring that the author gets credit for all of their contributions. Using ORCIDs will help ACM administer the ACM OPEN program where universities get open-access publishing via a subscription, aid in identifying conflicts of interests, and support other publications processes. ORCIDs are easy to obtain; it takes less than a minute. Prior and Simultaneous Submissions: The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions. Presentation of Accepted Papers: One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference. Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.

 Asymptotically good quantum and locally testable classical LDPC codes   
 P Panteleev  , G Kalachev - Proceedings of the 54th Annual ACM SIGACT …, 2022 - dl.acm.org   
 P Panteleev  , G Kalachev   
 Proceedings of the 54th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2022 •  dl.acm.org   
 We study classical and quantum LDPC codes of constant rate obtained by the lifted product  
  construction over non-abelian groups. We show that the obtained families of quantum LDPC  
  codes are asymptotically good, which proves the qLDPC conjecture. Moreover, we show  
  that the produced classical LDPC codes are also asymptotically good and locally testable  
  with constant query and soundness parameters, which proves a well-known conjecture in  
  the field of locally testable codes.

 Call for Papers  

 Call for Papers  
  
 The ACM International Systems and Storage Conference (SYSTOR) is an international forum for interaction across the systems research community. The program includes innovative, peer-reviewed research papers in the broad area of systems, as well as distinguished keynote lecturers, a poster session, and social events. ACM SYSTOR is designed to engage academic and industrial researchers and practitioners, welcoming both students and seasoned professionals.   

 Call for Papers  
 SYSTOR has traditionally welcomed academic and industrial papers in systems including storage, cloud and distributed systems, networking, and systems security, broadly construed. While continuing on this tradition, this year, we are broadening the scope to also include research on systems issues in AI and/or sustainability, including those that involve workload optimization, data processing, lifecycle of systems, carbon footprint transparency, and system re-designs. SYSTOR encourages submissions that describe results from experimental system prototypes, as well as experience papers describing practical deployments, and valuable lessons learned from them.   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:   
 Systems and workload optimization for AI/ML systems 
  Sustainability/carbon footprint of computer and network systems 
  System security and trust 
  Big Data infrastructure 
  Cloud, edge, data center, and distributed systems 
  Embedded and real-time systems 
  Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability 
  File and storage systems 
  Networked, mobile, wireless, peer-to-peer, and sensor systems 
  Operating systems, computer architecture, and their interactions 
  Performance evaluation and workload characterization 
  Runtime systems and compiler/programming-language support 
  System deployment, usage, and experience 
  System design or adaptation for emerging storage technologies 
  Virtualization and containers 
  Storage 3.0 
  SYSTOR 2024 solicits submissions in four separate categories:   
 Full Papers Track | – original research, at most 12 pages, excluding references 
  Short Papers Track | – original research, at most 5 pages, excluding references 
  Posters with Extended Abstract Track | – original work presented as a poster, accompanied by an extended abstract in the conference proceedings 
  Highlights Track for the Israeli Systems Workshop | – papers previously published in a systems conference 
  Attendance  
 Systor 2024 is postponed to September 23-24 and will be virtual.  
    
 Due to concerns about the current situation in Israel, ACM Systor 2024 conference will be virtual, in collaboration with the Israeli Systems Workshop on September 25  in the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel.

 // Research Track  

 SYSTOR accepts both full-length and short papers. A short paper is intended for an idea that can be described and evaluated in fewer pages; the goal of the short paper is not for preliminary work or workshop-style position papers.   
 A good SYSTOR paper should present a novel, compelling solution to a well-motivated problem. The evaluation should demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the solution in settings that are as realistic as possible, including test applications workloads, system parameters, and assumed constraints. Authors should clearly describe their contribution in the context of prior work, and draw meaningful conclusions from their work.   
 The program committee also encourages submissions that describe lessons learned from operational (especially large-scale) system deployments. Such submissions are expected to include sufficient details of the system, its design goals, and the methods used for evaluating whether these goals were met.   
 The program committee will value submissions accompanied by supplemental material such as traces and open-source code that can help reproduce the reported results, and advance additional research in the field.   
 A small set of outstanding papers will be forwarded to a suitable journal, such as ACM journal Transactions on Storage (TOS) or Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), for a fast-tracked review process for an expanded version of the paper.   
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all  ACM Publications Policies   , including ACM’s new  Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   .   
 Accepted papers may be invited to participate also in the Israeli Systems Workshop.  

 // Posters Track  

 SYSTOR also welcomes academic and industrial posters. See “Call for Papers” above for foci and relevant areas.   
 A good poster submission will articulate and motivate an interesting problem, and describe a new insight or approach to addressing this problem. It will clearly present the work in progress (or attained results), and the expected outcomes from future work. The poster should present these details in a manner that is clear and captivating.   
 Poster submissions should include a one-page extended abstract, and a draft of the poster. The extended abstracts of accepted posters will be included in the online conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will review poster submissions in a single-blind manner.   
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all  ACM Publications Policies   , including ACM’s new  Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   .   
 Accepted posters can opt-in for physical presentation at the Israeli Systems Workshop in person.  
 Additional posters to be presented (physically) in ISW – the Israeli Systems Workshop  only, can be submitted by September 5.  
   Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to sarelco@mta.ac.il  and moshesu@mta.ac.il   

 // HIGHLIGHTS TRACK - ISRAELI SYSTEMS WORKSHOP  

 The highlights track gives an opportunity for research, published over the last year in a systems conference (e.g., SOSP, OSDI, FAST, ASPLOS, EuroSys, ATC, NSDI), to reach a broader audience with a second presentation (similar to ATC’s “Best of the Rest” track). Highlight papers will be presented in-person  at the Israeli Systems Workshop on September 25, so at least one author must physically attend the workshop.  
 Submission should include the paper abstract and details (where / when) of the previous publication. The paper will not be republished in the SYSTOR conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  

 // Submission Instructions  

 Research papers (full and short) should be submitted through: https://systor24.hotcrp.com   
 Posters should be submitted through: https://systor24posters.hotcrp.com   
 Highlight papers for the Israeli Systems Workshop should be submitted through: https://systor24highlights.hotcrp.com   
 Additional posters to be presented (physically) in ISW – the Israeli Systems Workshop  only, can be submitted by September 5.  
   Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to sarelco@mta.ac.il  and moshesu@mta.ac.il   
  
 Review Process  
 The program committee will review submissions  to the Research Track in a double-blind manner. All submissions should be properly anonymized, removing all identifiable information whenever possible including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.   
 Any submissions accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement will be returned without review  .   
 Copyright and originality of the work  
 SYSTOR will enforce  ACM’s Plagiarism policy   regarding copying and resubmission of prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to SYSTOR must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal.   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the earlier of either the first day of the conference or the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to  two weeks prior   to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   
 Formatting instructions  
 Papers should be submitted electronically as a PDF. All text and figures must fit within a 7”x9” text block, centered on the page, using two columns with .33 inches of separation. The paper should be typeset using a 10-point font (Times New Roman or similar) with a 12-point (single-spaced) leading.   
 For the Full and Short Paper Tracks, please follow  paper formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template,  is available here   .   
 For the Posters Track, please follow  poster formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template, is available here   .   
 Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please email the program chairs: Sam H. Noh and Aviad Zuck  .    
 Additional instructions regarding camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be sent directly to the corresponding authors and will appear  he  re  after the notification to authors.   
 Virtual presentation instructions  
 Please follow the video preparation and presentation instructions provided here  .  
 Arxiv  
 A paper submitted to SYSTOR can be submitted simultaneously to Arxiv, with some changes. We would like the authors to make an honest effort to preserve anonymity. Please ensure the SYSTOR submission is using a different title and a different system name from the Arxiv version. It would be useful to let the chairs know if there is an Arxiv paper so that we can intervene if PC members find it accidentally and think the submission is plagiarizing the Arxiv paper.   
 Open Source  
 The authors of a SYSTOR submission are encouraged to associate a source code repo with their submission, but this repo must be completely anonymized. It is alright if a named (= not anonymized) source code repo exists, so long as it isn’t associated/linked with the submission in any way. An anonymized repo can be a clone of the named repo which is modified to be anonymous. Another way to do this is  https://anonymous.4open.science/   .

Highlight papers will be presented in-person  at the Israeli Systems Workshop on September 25, so at least one author must physically attend the workshop.  
 Submission should include the paper abstract and details (where / when) of the previous publication. The paper will not be republished in the SYSTOR conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  

 // Submission Instructions  

 Research papers (full and short) should be submitted through: https://systor24.hotcrp.com   
 Posters should be submitted through: https://systor24posters.hotcrp.com   
 Highlight papers for the Israeli Systems Workshop should be submitted through: https://systor24highlights.hotcrp.com   
 Additional posters to be presented (physically) in ISW – the Israeli Systems Workshop  only, can be submitted by September 5.  
   Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to sarelco@mta.ac.il  and moshesu@mta.ac.il   
  
 Review Process  
 The program committee will review submissions  to the Research Track in a double-blind manner. All submissions should be properly anonymized, removing all identifiable information whenever possible including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.   
 Any submissions accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement will be returned without review  .   
 Copyright and originality of the work  
 SYSTOR will enforce  ACM’s Plagiarism policy   regarding copying and resubmission of prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to SYSTOR must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal.   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the earlier of either the first day of the conference or the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to  two weeks prior   to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   
 Formatting instructions  
 Papers should be submitted electronically as a PDF. All text and figures must fit within a 7”x9” text block, centered on the page, using two columns with .33 inches of separation. The paper should be typeset using a 10-point font (Times New Roman or similar) with a 12-point (single-spaced) leading.   
 For the Full and Short Paper Tracks, please follow  paper formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template,  is available here   .   
 For the Posters Track, please follow  poster formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template, is available here   .   
 Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please email the program chairs: Sam H. Noh and Aviad Zuck  .    
 Additional instructions regarding camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be sent directly to the corresponding authors and will appear  he  re  after the notification to authors.   
 Virtual presentation instructions  
 Please follow the video preparation and presentation instructions provided here  .  
 Arxiv  
 A paper submitted to SYSTOR can be submitted simultaneously to Arxiv, with some changes. We would like the authors to make an honest effort to preserve anonymity. Please ensure the SYSTOR submission is using a different title and a different system name from the Arxiv version. It would be useful to let the chairs know if there is an Arxiv paper so that we can intervene if PC members find it accidentally and think the submission is plagiarizing the Arxiv paper.   
 Open Source  
 The authors of a SYSTOR submission are encouraged to associate a source code repo with their submission, but this repo must be completely anonymized. It is alright if a named (= not anonymized) source code repo exists, so long as it isn’t associated/linked with the submission in any way. An anonymized repo can be a clone of the named repo which is modified to be anonymous. Another way to do this is  https://anonymous.4open.science/   .

  CONTACT 
    
 Welcome!  
 Tableau methods have been found to be a convenient formalism for automating deduction in various non-standard logics as well as in classical logic. Areas of application include verification of software and computer systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its required inference engines, and system diagnosis.  
 The International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods  (TABLEAUX) brings together researchers interested in all aspects - theoretical foundations, implementation techniques, systems development and applications - of the mechanization of reasoning with tableaux and related methods.  
 TABLEAUX has been held every year since 1992. Starting in 1995, the proceedings have been published in Springer's LNCS/LNAI series.

 ACM SenSys 2025  
  6 - 9 May  Irvine, USA   
 The 23rd ACM Conference on  
  Embedded Networked Sensor Systems   
 In transition to Conference on  
  Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems    

 Announcement from the Joint  
  SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI Steering Committee  
 We are excited to announce the merger of three leading conferences — ACM SenSys, ACM/IEEE IPSN, and ACM/IEEE IoTDI — into a single premier event under the new name SenSys: Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems  . This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The new SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field.   
 ACM SenSys 2025  will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, but retaining the current SenSys name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) due to the time required for institutional approvals. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. We are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.

 Submission Guidelines:  
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be at most 12 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages  with 10-pt font size (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables.  As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here  . LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font (override default font of 9-pt). Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system.  
   
  Papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library and presented in person at the conference.

 SYNASC 2024 International Symposium – Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing – 26th edition  

 October 1, 2024 
  11:18 am 

 Between September 16-19, the 26th edition of the SYNASC International Symposium took place ( https://synasc.ro/2024/  ) organized by the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in collaboration with the Institute of Symbolic Computing of the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria and the e-Austria Institute in Timișoara.  
 This year's edition was attended by 110 researchers from 23 countries who presented theoretical and applied results in the field of symbolic and numerical computation, mathematical logic, programming, theoretical foundations of computer science, distributed computing and artificial intelligence.  
 The SYNASC Symposium is recognized nationally and internationally as a scientific event that sets a high bar in terms of the quality of the papers. The evaluation of the works is done by an international program committee coordinated every year by an internationally recognized specialist. This year, the scientific coordinator of the symposium was Prof. dr. Fairouz Kamereddine  from University of Edinburgh, UK  . Since 2005, the selected and presented papers are included in a volume published by CPS (Conference Publishing Systems) and submitted for indexing in WoS, Scopus, etc.  
 The program of each of the 4 days of the symposium included guest presentations given by leading researchers from the country and abroad. At this edition, the following were invited to give plenary presentations: Kadi Bouatouch (University of Rennes, France), Mike Preuss (University of Leiden, Netherlands), Sasa Radomirovic (University of Surrey, UK), Amr Sabry (Indiana University, USA), Dan Tufiš (Romanian Academy).  The participants thus had the opportunity to learn about the latest research directions in various fields related to the theme of the symposium: formal methods in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, statistical models applied in graphics and artificial vision, multicriteria optimization applied in chemistry, cyber security with applications in the implementation of electronic voting systems, ethical aspects in artificial intelligence.   
 In addition to these presentations, three tutorials were included in the program, mainly addressed to young researchers, supported by Carlos Cano Domingo (Barcelona Supercomputing Center), Andrei Alexandru (Romanian Academy) and Gabriel Ciobanu (Romanian Academy)  .   
 In addition to the sessions dedicated to the main sections of the symposium, 4 workshops were held on related topics (agent systems for solving complex problems, iterative methods in determining fixed points, nature-inspired computing and applications of serious games) and two special sessions ( one dedicated to doctoral students and one oriented towards the computational methods used to model the transition to a clean energy). The workshops as well as the session dedicated to the IT industry allowed the establishment of contacts and collaborations between researchers from the academic environment and researchers from the industrial environment. In the session dedicated to doctoral students, two prizes were awarded for the best papers in the field of theoretical informatics (Rareș Mateiu, University of Bucharest) and in the field of artificial intelligence (Ariana Șerpar, West University of Timișoara).  
 In parallel with SYNASC 2024, the eighth edition of the Working Formal Methods international symposium (FROM 16 – https://from18.uvt.ro/), a traveling symposium hosted periodically by the universities of Bucharest, took place between 2024-2024 September. Cluj-Napoca, Iasi and Timisoara. The symposium brought together researchers and practitioners of formal methods to present new theoretical results, methods, techniques and frameworks, as well as software tools that facilitate the application of formal methods and build on the presented theoretical results. The symposium program included 2 invited presentations, 4 tutorials and 11 presentations of peer-reviewed papers. Guest presentations and tutorials were delivered by Nikolaj Bjorner (Microsoft Research, USA), Isabela Drămnesc (West University of Timișoara), Mădălina Erașcu (West University of Timișoara)  , Laura Kovacs (Technical University of Vienna, Austria), Vlad Rusu (INRIA Lille, France), Andrei Voronkov (University of Manchester).   
 SYNASC 2024 benefited from the support, as sponsors, of some companies in the IT field among which we mention: CyberThor Studios, Continental, Nokia, ETA2U, Forvia Hella, CyberBee Software and MemIQ.

 History  
   
 The ITP conference series is dedicated to interactive theorem proving and related topics, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification security, and formalization of mathematics. The inaugural meeting of ITP was held on 11 to 14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9 to 21 July 2010). ITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009.  
 The TPHOLs Conference Series  
 TPHOLs 2009 was the twenty-second in a series of international conferences on the applications of higher-order logic theorem proving. The first three (two at Cambridge and one at Århus) were informal users' meetings for the HOL system and were the only ones without published papers. Between 1991 and 1995 (Davis, Leuven Vancouver, Malta, Utah) the conference entertained an increasingly wide field of interest.  
 The evolution resulted in the program committee for the meeting in Turku (1996) deeming that the scope of the conference included all reasoning tools for higher-order logics and adopting the name TPHOLs, an acronym for Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics. (The final letter was considered necessary to break the direct connection between the conference and the HOL system.) This decision was strongly endorsed at the business sessions at Turku and Murray Hill (1997).  
 Traditions  
 A long-standing convention is that the annual conference should be held in a continent different to the location of the previous meeting. Another tradition is that the organizers for each meeting handle all aspects of the conference for the whole year in consultation with the previous few organizers. This includes selection of the program committee, editing the proceedings fund-raising, program, and local arrangements. Another responsibility of the organizers in year n  is to call for bids and conduct a poll for the selection of the venue for the conference in year n  + 1.

  Abstract:  The increasing role of quantified Boolean logic in many applications calls for practically efficient decision procedures. One of the most promising paradigms is the semantic tree format implemented in the style of the DPLL procedure. In this paper, so-called learningtec hniques like intelligent backtrackingand caching of lemmas which proved useful in the pure propositional case are generalised to the quantified Boolean case and the occuring differences are discussed. Due to the strong restriction of the variable selection in semantic tree procedures for quantified Boolean formulas, learning methods are more important than in the propositional case, as we demonstrate. Furthermore, in addition to the caching of lemmas, significant advances can be achieved by techniques based on the caching of models, too. The theoretical effect of these improvements is illustrated by a comparison of the search spaces on pathological examples. We also describe the basic features of the system Semprop, which is an efficient implementation of (some of) the developed techniques, and give the results of an experimental evaluation of the system on a number of practical examples.

  Abstract:  The paper studies the automation of minimal model inference, i.e., determining whether a formula is true in every minimal model of the premises. A novel tableau calculus for prepositional minimal model reasoning is presented in two steps. First an analytic clausal tableau calculus employing a restricted cut rule is introduced. Then the calculus is extended to handle minimal model inference by employing a groundedness property of minimal models. A decision procedure based on the basic calculus is devised and then it is extended to minimal model inference. The basic decision procedure and its extension enjoy some interesting properties. When deciding logical consequence, the basic procedure explores the search space of counter-models with a preference to minimal models and each counter-model is not generated more than once. The procedures can be implemented to run in polynomial space, and they provide polynomial time decision procedures for Horn clauses. The extended decision procedure can also be used to finding all minimal models of a set of clauses.

  Abstract:  Probabilistic guidance based on learned knowledge is added to the connection tableau calculus and implemented on top of the lean-CoP theorem prover, linking it to an external advisor system In the typical mathematical setting of solving many problems in a large complex theory, learning from successful solutions is then used for guiding theorem proving attempts in the spirit of the MaLARea system While in MaLARea learning-based axiom selection is done outside unmodified theorem provers, in MaLeCoP the learning-based selection is done inside the prover, and the interaction between learning of knowledge and its application can be much finer This brings interesting possibilities for further construction and training of self-learning AI mathematical experts on large mathematical libraries, some of which are discussed The initial implementation is evaluated on the MPTP Challenge large theory benchmark

 Efficient Temporal Logic Runtime Monitoring for Tiny Systems  
  Abstract   
 While the theory and practice of runtime monitoring are overall well developed, in embedded systems, runtime monitoring is not as common as one would expect. Especially small-scale embedded systems, which are found in many household devices, are often somewhat safety-critical and could benefit from the possibility to detect software or hardware defects that cannot be uncovered with verification alone. While monitoring frameworks such as RTLola and Copilot are available to address this problem, employing them leads to a gap between verification and runtime monitoring by these frameworks having specialized specification languages for monitoring, and what can be expressed in them is incomparable to the capabilities of the temporal logics traditionally employed in formal verification.   
 This paper discusses how (linear) temporal logic runtime monitoring for small-scale embedded systems can be made more efficient and attractive to the embedded systems practitioner. This includes identifying why monitoring for traditional temporal logics is somewhat inefficient in software, how this problem can be addressed in a low-cost way, and how runtime monitors can become a more useful component of an embedded system. By providing a way to translate a specification to monitor code that also tracks the reason for a specification violation, the overall approach discussed in the paper makes spending developer time on writing a relatively precise specification of a system to build attractive, which also helps paving the way to make formal verification for small-scale embedded systems more common.

 Is MCDC Really Better? Lessons from Combining Tests and Proofs  
  Abstract   
 MCDC, for “Modified Condition/Decision Coverage”, is a test coverage criterion recommended in several important industrial software safety standards. The intuition behind MCDC is that it should be more effective than industry’s default coverage criterion, branch coverage, since it uses a finer-grain decomposition of program conditions.   
 Manually generating MCDC-compliant test suites is, however, tedious and error-prone; there is, as a result, little empirical evidence of whether that intuition holds up in practice. Does MCDC really provide enough of an advantage over branch coverage to justify the extra work and longer test runs?   
 To help answer this question, the present work takes advantage of verification technology that combines tests and proofs, based on the AutoProof program verifier.   
 For each decision point in the program, the approach proceeds in four steps. First, compute a set of conditions that satisfy MCDC. Then, inject into the program, for each combination, an incorrect instruction (a “seeded contradiction” in the terminology of previous work). Next, apply the prover to verify the instrumented program; the prover naturally fails, but in the process it produces a set of counterexamples  covering all the combinations. Finally, turn this result into a directly usable test suite—guaranteed by construction to satisfy the MCDC criterion.   
 The results, on a significant set of example programs, yield insights on how MCDC coverage compares to branch coverage and adaptive random testing when trying to detect faults.

 Refining CEGAR-Based Test-Case Generation with Feasibility Annotations  
  Abstract   
 Often, testing is part of software quality assurance, in which testers may use automatic tools to generate test cases. To avoid redundant work, the tools may consider collateral coverage, i.e., use that a test case generated for a particular test goal, e.g., a branch, may cover further goals. We present a novel approach to use collateral coverage during test-case generation with software model checkers that apply counterexample-guided abstraction refinement. For every test goal, those model checkers perform a reachability analysis, which we plan to support with previous test inputs. More concretely, we use a feasibility annotation to map already covered goals to their test inputs. Whenever the reachability analysis detects a syntactical path to an uncovered test goal, we select a test input from the feasibility annotation that is likely a (partial) input for the path and use this input as a potential guide to check whether the path is semantically feasible. So far, we have integrated our approach into  and evaluated it on the Test-Comp tasks. Compared to the original  approach, our approach performs similar or better. In total, we increase the achieved branch coverage by 2%, but may achieve a significantly larger increase for some tasks.

 No Smoke Without Fire: Detecting Specification Inconsistencies with Frama-C/WP  
  Abstract   
 Deductive verification provides a proof that, under the provided pre-conditions, each terminating execution of a given function satisfies the stated post-conditions. In general, pre- and post-conditions are expressed in a logical specification language and typically rely on theories including abstract definitions, axioms and lemmas. As they are written by humans, errors may be introduced into specifications. Some errors can be detected when the proof fails, but sometimes, they remain unnoticed due to misleading proofs: most of the program may become dead code under the provided pre-conditions, or the proof may succeed because of inconsistencies in hypotheses and axioms. In this tool paper, we explore how to detect such unwanted situations by using deductive verification techniques and describe the smoke test mechanism in Frama-C  / WP  , a popular deductive verifier for C  code. We show that, while the intuitive idea is simple, making it practical requires optimizations to scale up, and report on experiments with critical industrial code. Although our method is based on proof techniques, it is not complete and is similar to testing. In the end, can we ever be sure that our programs are proved well enough?

 Runtime Verification for High-Level Security Properties: Case Study on the TPM Software Stack  
  Abstract   
 The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a cryptoprocessor designed to provide hardware-based secure storage and protect integrity of modern computers. Communications with the TPM go through the TPM Software Stack (TSS), a popular implementation of which is the open-source library tpm2-tss  . It is thus crucial to ensure that no leak of sensitive data may occur in the TSS during communications between the host platform and the TPM. Recent work on deductive verification of functional and safety properties for this library faced several challenges. The purpose of this case study paper is to focus on high-level security properties, and to propose an alternative validation approach for such properties on the library by using runtime verification. We describe the proposed approach, apply it to specify and verify at runtime some key security properties using the Frama-C  verification platform and report on our first evaluation results.

 Cyclone: A New Tool for Verifying/Testing Graph-Based Structures  
  Tool Paper   
 Abstract   
 We present a new tool called Cyclone that can be used for verifying and testing graph-based models. Different from other verification tools, Cyclone provides users with a unique way of building models and specifying their properties, by explicitly constructing and reasoning about graphs. As graphs can naturally capture both static and dynamic behaviours of a system, this allows users to represent many challenging problems. In this tool paper, we describe Cyclone’s basic features through different examples. Our preliminary evaluation results show that Cyclone has a promising potential in handling verification tasks from various domains and good usability for those who are not familiar with using verification tools.

 Model-Based Testing of Quantum Computations  
  Abstract   
 Quantum computers are able to effectively solve certain types of problems being intractable by classical computers, including tasks from linear optimization, machine learning and simulation of natural phenomena. The counter-intuitive behavior of quantum algorithms makes it particularly important to develop practical techniques and tools to support the analysis and quality assurance of quantum programs. For classical programs, software testing is today one of the most effective and easy-to-use quality-assurance techniques. However, many postulates of quantum physics like superposition, entanglement and non-cloneability of qubit states as well as the probabilistic outcome and destructive effects of qubit measurements obstruct any straight-forward adaptation of classical testing techniques to quantum programs. Recent works either treat quantum programs as black-box components with classical interfaces to apply end-to-end testing or shift the focus of quality assurance to formal verification of quantum programs. In this paper, we instead propose a model-based framework for testing quantum computations at the level of execution traces. Our approach is independent of the quantum programming language and hardware used and utilizes probabilistic transition systems as abstract test model for both the specification and implementation to be tested. In our model, we carefully distinguish between controllable and observable as well as between nondeterministic and probabilistic test steps. Our framework makes quantum program testing a partly reactive process that can be complemented by statistical approaches for identifying erroneous qubit states by repeated measurements.

 Affinitree: A Compositional Framework for Formal Analysis and Explanation of Deep Neural Networks  
  Abstract   
 We present Affinitree  , a compositional framework for analyzing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based on three elementary principles: (1) symbolic execution, (2) infeasible path elimination, and (3) abstraction. The combination of these principles allows one to elegantly solve a number of interesting analysis and verification tasks, like traditional verification problems with pre- and post-conditions, model explanations in terms of semantically equivalent decision trees, concolic execution for slice-oriented testing, and visual verification of two-dimensional slices. The paper illustrates the flexibility of Affinitree  over three different use cases covering fairness evaluation, adversarial examples, and counterfactuals. Affinitree  is available as a modular open source library for replication, experimentation, and extension.

 Exploring Loose Coupling of Slicing with Dynamic Symbolic Execution on the JVM  
  Abstract   
 Dynamic symbolic execution is an effective technique for fuzzing programs with application to software verification as well if the search terminates during symbolic execution. However, the state space explosion problem often prevents the symbolic search from exploring the entire state space. As static analysis operates on the whole program rather than single execution paths, it can cut out parts of the program that are irrelevant for verifying a property. In this paper, we explore how slicing can be used before dynamic symbolic execution for analyzing assertion reachability in Java  programs. We report on our first experience using state-of-the-art open-source Java  slicers on the SV-COMP Java  benchmark before applying GDart  , a dynamic symbolic execution engine for Java  . Currently, this experiment has not been successful, as the slicers are not mature enough to reliably produce correct slices of a task in the SV-COMP benchmark. However, in a few examples, the approach delivered promising results that motivate the future development of slicers for Java  .

  Scope  
 TAP 2024 is the 18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs. TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.  
 Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing.  
 TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.

 The 19th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering  
  
 TASE 2025   
 July 14-16  2025    
 Limassol, Cyprus      

 WELCOME   

 The 19th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE 2025) will be held in Limassol, Cyprus on July 14-16, 2025. TASE 2025 aims to provide a forum for people from academia and industry to communicate their latest results on innovative advances in software engineering. Modern society is increasingly dependent on software systems that are becoming larger and more complex. This poses new challenges to the various aspects of software engineering, for instance, software dependability in trusted computing, interaction with physical components in cyber physical systems, quality assurance in AI-embedded systems, distribution in cloud computing applications, security and privacy in general. Hence, new concepts and methodologies are required to enhance the development of software engineering from theoretical aspects.  
 TASE 2025 is the 19th in the TASE series. The past TASE symposia were successfully held in Shanghai (’07), Nanjing (’08), Tianjin (’09), Taipei (’10), Xi’an (’11), Beijing (’12), Birmingham (’13), Changsha(’14), Nanjing(’15), Shanghai(’16), Nice(’17), Guangzhou(’18), Guilin(’19), Hangzhou (’20), Shanghai (’21), Cluj-Napoca (’22), Bristol (’23), Guiyang (’24)  .   
 The proceedings of the TASE 2025 symposium will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer). The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers in the journal Science of Computer Programming ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming  ).

 No PDF available, click to view other formats  Abstract:  The TARK conference (Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge) is a conference that aims to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, including computer science, artificial intelligence, game theory, decision theory, philosophy, logic, linguistics, and cognitive science. Its goal is to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge.  
  Previous conferences have been held biennially around the world since 1986, on the initiative of Joe Halpern (Cornell University). Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, awareness and uncertainty, bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, epistemic game theory, knowledge and action, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and foundations of multi-agent systems. Information about TARK, including conference proceedings, is available at this http URL   
  These proceedings contain the papers that have been accepted for presentation at the Nineteenth Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK 2023), held between June 28 and June 30, 2023, at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. The conference website can be found at this https URL

 About this course:    The EPICENTER   , our research center on Epistemic Game Theory  at Maastricht University, offers this two-week intensive course as an introduction to the blooming field of Epistemic Game Theory  .  This field takes a new, fresh approach to game theory, and studies how people reason  in game theoretic situations before they eventually make a choice. More precisely, it explores how we reason about the minds of others  before we make a choice. Hence, the reasoning of people like you and me is at the center stage of epistemic game theory.   
 The course consists of three parts:  standard reasoning  in static games, cautious reasoning  in static games, and reasoning in dynamic games.   
 In static games  , the players only make one choice, and choose in complete ignorance of the other players’ choices. For standard reasoning we focus on the central reasoning concept of common belief in rationality  , and investigate what happens if we add a correct beliefs  assumption.  
 Cautious reasoning  means that a player, before he makes a choice himself, does not completely discard any opponent’s choice from consideration. For this part we will investigate different variants of common belief in rationality.  
 In dynamic games  , a player may have to make more than one choice, and may fully or partially observe what other players have done before he makes a choice himself. We explore backward and forward induction reasoning  , embodied by the reasoning concepts of common belief in future rationality  and common strong belief in rationality.   
 Last year we have provided a course on  incomplete information  ,  unawareness  and  psychological games  . To follow this year’s course, it is  not necessary  to have followed the previous edition. In fact, you should be able to follow this year’s course without having any prior knowledge about game theory. The course is completely  self-contained  .   
 Audience:    The course is primarily meant for advanced bachelor students, master students and PhD students all over the world, but researchers are also very welcome.  
 Instructors:    The instructors for this course are Christian Bach (University of Reading, UK), Rubén Becerril (Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana de Mexico), Stephan Jagau (University of Nottingham, UK), Niels Mourmans (Central Bureau of Statistics, Netherlands), Andrés Perea (Maastricht University, Netherlands), Joep van Sloun (Maastricht University, The Netherlands) and Elias Tsakas (Maastricht University, Netherlands) — all members of our EPICENTER.  For more information about the instructors, click here   
 L   iterature:    The course will be based on the textbook “Epistemic Game Theory: Reasoning and Choice”   by Andrés Perea. The book has been published by Cambridge University Press in 2012.  
    
 Organization of the course:    The course stretches over 10 days, of which the last day consists of a written exam. Typically, a day consists of two theory lectures and one exercise session, where the two theory lectures cover one chapter from the book “Epistemic Game Theory: Reasoning and Choice”   .  One exception is the day where Elias Tsakas presents advanced topics, which are not covered by the book, and for which there are no exercises. In the exercise sessions we will discuss some problems from the book which you should prepare the day before. On the last Thursday we will discuss the exam from 2023. Your grade will be based on the exam. To pass the exam, you must score at least a 5.5 out of 10. But you are also free to participate without taking the exam.  
 Certificate:    If you attend at least 20 out of 23 sessions, you will receive an official certificate stating that you successfully followed the course. The certificate also states that the workload of this course corresponds to 6.5 ECTS. If you successfully take the exam, by scoring at least a 5.5 out of 10, you will receive a special certificate which states that you also took the exam, and it specifies the grade you obtained for the exam. At your home university, this should normally be sufficient to obtain 6.5 ECTS for following the course.  
 Housing:    If you would like to rent a room in Maastricht at a reasonable price during these two weeks, please visit: https://www.maastrichthousing.com/  .  They offer rooms / apartments at a very reasonable price per day. On their website, indicate that you are a summer school student.

 EPICENTER  Working Paper Series  
  2024:   
 Stephan Jagau: Additive context-dependent preferences.  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 31 (2024)  
 Abstract:   
 “Money equals utility” remains the benchmark across a vast range of economics and game theory-experiments. Subjecting this assumption to experimental testing requires an empirically tractable theory of context-dependent preferences. This paper presents novel foundations for expected utility based on context-dependent preferences in games and other state-dependent decision problems. Crucially, these behavioral foundations do not require empirically implausible comparisons of alternatives across different states. Moreover, they substantially relax previous diversity-type assumptions, significantly expanding the range of problems that can be accommodated and paving the way for a general state-dependent expected utility representation for any multi-act, multi-state context-dependent preference system. A central application is to direct utility measurement in games, enabling a causal understanding of how e.g. risk- and social-preferences affect strategic choice.  
  Andrés Perea: Consequentialism in dynamic games.  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 30 (2024)  
 Abstract:   
 In philosophy and decision theory, consequentialism  reflects the assumption that an act is evaluated solely on the basis of the consequences it may induce, and nothing else. In this paper we study the idea of consequentialism in dynamic games by considering two versions: A commonly used utility-based version stating that the player’s preferences are governed by a utility function on consequences, and a preference-based version which faithfully translates the original idea of consequentialism to restrictions on the player’s preferences. Utility-based consequentialism always implies preference-based consequentialism, but the other direction is not necessarily true, as is shown by means of a counterexample. It turns out that utility-based consequentialism is equivalent to the assumption that the induced preference intensities on consequences are additive, whereas preference-based consequentialism only requires this property for every pair of strategies in isolation. We finally show that if the dynamic game either (i) has two strategies for the player we consider, or (ii) has observed past choices, or (iii) involves only two players and has perfect recall, then the two notions of consequentialism are equivalent in the absence of weakly dominated strategies.  
  Andrés Perea: Dynamic consistency in games without expected utility  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 29 (2024)  
 Abstract:   
 Within dynamic games we are interested in conditions on the players’ preferences that imply dynamic consistency  and the existence of sequentially optimal strategies.  The latter means that the strategy is optimal at each of the player’s information sets, given his beliefs there. These two properties are needed to undertake a meaningful game-theoretic analysis in dynamic games. To explore this we assume that every player holds a conditional preference relation — a mapping that assigns to every probabilistic belief about the opponents’ strategies a preference relation over his own strategies. We identify sets of very basic conditions on the conditional preference relations that guarantee dynamic consistency and the existence of sequentially optimal strategies, respectively. These conditions are implied by, but are much weaker than, assuming expected utility. That is, to undertake a meaningful game-theoretic analysis in dynamic games we can do with much less than expected utility.

 Joep van Sloun: Rationalizability and monotonicity in games with incomplete information  . EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 28 (2023)  
 Abstract:   
 This paper examines games with strategic complements or substitutes and incomplete information, where players are uncertain about the opponents’ parameters. We assume that the players’ beliefs about the opponent’s parameters are selected from some given set of beliefs. One extreme is the case where these sets only contain a single belief, representing a scenario where the players’ actual beliefs about the parameters are commonly known among the players. Another extreme is the situation where these sets contain all possible beliefs, representing a scenario where the players have no information about the opponents’ beliefs about parameters. But we also allow for intermediate cases, where these sets contain some, but not all, possible beliefs about the parameters. We introduce an assumption of weakly increasing differences that takes both the choice belief and parameter belief of a player into account. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that greater choice-parameter beliefs leads to greater optimal choices. Moreover,  
  we show that the greatest and least point rationalizable choice of a player is increasing in their parameter, and these can be determined through an iterative procedure. In each round of the iterative procedure, the lowest surviving choice is optimal for the lowest choice-parameter belief, while the greatest surviving choice is optimal for the highest choice-parameter belief.  
  Martin Meier and Andrés Perea: Forward induction in a backward inductive manner  . EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 27 (2023)  
 Abstract:   
 We propose a new rationalizability concept for dynamic games with imperfect information, forward and backward rationalizability  , that combines elements from forward and backward induction reasoning. It proceeds by applying the forward induction concept of extensive-form rationalizability  in a backward inductive fashion: It first applies extensive-form rationalizability from the last period onwards, subsequently from the penultimate period onwards, keeping the restrictions from the last period, and so on, until we reach the beginning of the game. We show that it is characterized epistemically by (a) first imposing common strong belief in rationality from the last period onwards, then (b) imposing common strong belief in rationality from the penultimate period onwards, keeping the restrictions imposed by (a), and so on. It turns out that in terms of outcomes, the concept is equivalent to the pure forward induction concept of extensive-form rationalizability, but both concepts may differ in terms of strategies. We argue that the new concept provides a more compelling theory for how players react to surprises  . In terms of strategies, the new concept provides a refinement of the pure backward induction reasoning as embodied by backward dominance  and backwards rationalizability  . In fact, the new concept can be viewed as a backward looking strengthening of the forward looking concept of backwards rationalizability. Combining our results yields that every extensive-form rationalizable outcome is also backwards rationalizable. Finally, it is shown that the concept of forward and backward rationalizability satisfies the principle of supergame monotonicity  : If a player learns that the game was actually preceded by some moves he was initially unaware of, then this new information will only refine, but never completely overthrow, his reasoning. Extensive-form rationalizability violates this principle.

 Joep van Sloun: Rationalizable behavior in the Hotelling-Downs model of spatial competition.  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 26 (2022)  
 Abstract:   
 We consider three scenarios of the Hotelling-Downs model of spatial competition. The first scenario is a static setting with fixed prices and an arbitrary number of agents. This setting has typically been explored using Nash equilibrium, but this paper uses rationalizability instead. These findings will be compared to the results of Eaton and Lipsey (1975) and Shaked (1982). We show that as the number of agents increases, the set of point rationalizable choices increases as well. The second variation consists of a sequential Hotelling-Downs model with three agents, which will be solved by backward induction. The third variation is the static case when agents have limited attraction intervals. In this variation, we show that the set of rationalizable choices does not depend on the number of agents, apart from the number of agents being odd or even. It does depend on the size of the attraction interval. More precisely, the set of rationalizable choices shrinks as the attraction interval gets larger.

 Stephan Jagau: The fundamental theorem of epistemic game theory: The infinite case.  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 25 (2021)  
 Abstract:   
 In auction theory, industrial organization, and other applications of games in economics, it is often convenient to let infinite strategy sets stand in for large finite strategy sets. A tacit assumption is that results for infinite games will translate back to their finite counterparts. Transfinite eliminations of  
  non-best replies pose a radical challenge here, suggesting that common belief in rationality in infinite games may strictly refine up to k-fold belief in rationality for all finite k. I provide two equivalent characterizations of common belief in rationality for general purely measurable beliefs-type spaces.  
  The first one is the usual transfinite elimination of non-best replies. The second one, elimination of non-best replies and supporting beliefs, entirely avoids transfinite eliminations. Hence, rather than revealing new depths of reasoning, transfinite eliminations signal an inadequacy of eliminating non-best replies as a general description for strategic rationality.  
  Christian W. Bach and Andrés Perea: Structure preserving transformations of epistemic models.  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 24 (2021)  
 Abstract:   
 The prevailing approaches to modelling interactive uncertainty with epistemic models in economics are state-based and type-based. We explicitly formulate two general procedures that transform state models into type models and vice versa. Both transformation procedures preserve the belief hierarchies as well as the common prior assumption. By means of counterexamples it is shown that the two procedures are not inverse to each other. However, if attention is restricted to maximally reduced epistemic models, then isomorphisms can be constructed and an inverse relationship emerges.  
  Silvia Milano and Andrés Perea: Rational updating at the crossroads.  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 23 (2021)  
 Abstract:   
 In this paper we explore the absentminded driver problem using two different scenarios. In the first scenario we assume that the driver is capable of reasoning about his degree of absentmindedness before he hits the highway. This leads to a Savage-style model where the states are mutually exclusive and the act-state independence is in place. In the second we employ centred possibilities, by modelling the states (i.e. the events about which the driver is uncertain) as the possible final destinations indexed by a time period. The optimal probability we find for continuing at an exit is different from almost all papers in the literature. In this scenario, act-state independence is still violated, but states are mutually exclusive and the driver arrives at his optimal choice probability via Bayesian updating. We show that our solution is the only one guaranteeing immunity from sure loss via a Dutch strategy, and that — despite initial appearances — it is time consistent.  
  2020:   
 Andrés Perea: A foundation for expected utility in decision problems and games  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 22 (2020)  
 Abstract:   
 In a decision problem or game we typically fix the person’s utilities but not his beliefs. What, then, do these utilities represent? To explore this question we assume, like Gilboa and Schmeidler (2003), that the decision maker holds a conditional preference relation  — a mapping that assigns to every possible probabilistic belief a preference relation over his choices. We impose a list of axioms on such conditional preference relations, and show that it singles out precisely those conditional preference relations that admit an expected utility representation. The key axiom is the existence of a uniform preference increase  , stating that there must be an alternative conditional preference relation that, for a given choice, uniformly increases the preference for that choice by a constant degree. We also present a procedure that can be used to construct, for a given conditional preference relation satisfying the axioms, a utility function that represents it. If there are no weakly dominated choices, the existence of a uniform preference increase is equivalent to two easily verifiable conditions: strong transitivity  and the line property  .  
  Martin Meier and Andrés Perea: Reasoning about your own future mistakes  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 21 (2020)  
 Abstract:   
 We propose a model of reasoning in dynamic games in which a player, at each information set, holds a conditional belief about his own future choices and the opponents’ future choices. These conditional beliefs are assumed to be cautious, that is, the player never completely rules out any feasible future choice by himself or the opponents. We impose the following key conditions: (a) a player always believes that he will choose rationally in the future, (b) a player always believes that his opponents will choose rationally in the future, and (c) a player deems his own mistakes infinitely less likely than the opponents’ mistakes. Common belief in these conditions leads to the new concept of perfect quasi-perfect rationalizability. We show that perfectly quasi-perfectly rationalizable strategies exist in every finite dynamic game. We prove, moreover, that perfect quasi-perfect rationalizability constitutes a refinement of both perfect rationalizability (a rationalizability analogue to Selten’s (1975) perfect equilibrium) and quasi-perfect rationalizability (a rationalizability analogue to van Damme’s (1984) quasi-perfect equilibrium).

 Niels Mourmans: Reasoning in psychological games: When is iterated elimination of choices enough?,  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 20 (2019)  
 Abstract:   
 The framework of psychological game theory has allowed for the modelling of a wide range of belief-dependent motivations. At the same time, analysing psychological games can get complex rather quickly due to the fact that higher-order beliefs may enter the utility functions. As a result, some nice properties of traditional games fail to carry over to psychological games in general. This includes the failure of the iterated elimination of strictly dominated choices (IESDC) to always exactly characterize the choices that are rationally played under belief hierarchies expressing common belief in rationality. In this paper we characterize the families of two-player expectation-based psychological games for which IESDC yields exactly the choices that are rationally played under common belief in rationality. We characterize these games based on which orders of beliefs are directly utility-relevant for a decision-maker. In total we identify three cases. Two of these are relatively trivial: (i) the decision-maker’s utility depends on a single, even order of belief and (ii) the decision-maker’s utility and her opponent’s utility depend on a single order of belief. We also identify a third, non-trivial case. Our novel notion of causality diagrams, which capture those orders of beliefs that are (indirectly) utility-relevant, is used to obtain our results.  
  Christian W. Bach and Jérémie Cabessa: Agreeing to Disagree and Lexicographic Probability Systems  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 19 (2019)  
 Abstract:   
 In this note we explore agreeing to disagree with lexicographic probability systems. By means of a counterexample, it is shown that agents can agree to lexicographically disagree on their posteriors. Based on this observation, we propose the same excluding condition which essentially states that agents synchronically either neglect or consider their private information. A lexicographic agreement theorem ensues with equal posteriors at every level.

 Christian W. Bach and Andrés Perea: Two Definitions of Correlated Equilibrium  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 18 (2018)  
 Abstract:   
 Correlated equilibrium has been introduced by Aumann (1974). Often, in the literature, correlated equilibrium is defined in a simplified as well as more direct way, and sometimes called canonical correlated equilibrium or correlated equilibrium distribution. In fact, we show that the simplified notion of correlated equilibrium is not equivalent – neither doxastically nor behaviourally — to the original from an ex post perspective. We then compare both solution concepts in terms of reasoning. While correlated equilibrium can be characterized by common belief in rationality and a common prior, the simplified variant additionally requires the one-theory-per-choice condition. Since this condition features a correctness of beliefs property, the latter solution concept exhibits a larger degree of Nash equilibrium flavour than the former.  
  Rubén Becerril-Borja and Andrés Perea: Common Belief in Future and Restricted Past Rationality  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 17 (2018)  
 Abstract:   
 We introduce the idea that a player believes at every stage of a dynamic game that his opponents will choose rationally in the future and have chosen rationally in a restricted way in the past. This is summarized by the concept of common belief in future and restricted past rationality, which is defined epistemically. Moreover, it is shown that every properly rationalizable strategy of the normal form of a dynamic game can be chosen in the dynamic game under common belief in future and restricted past rationality. We also present an algorithm that uses strict dominance, and show that its full implementation selects exactly those strategies that can be chosen under common belief in future and restricted past rationality.  
  Niels Mourmans: Cautious Reasoning in Psychological Games  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 16 (2018)  
 Abstract:   
 Caution is an integral part of many solution concepts in traditional game theory and is commonly modeled using lexicographic beliefs. We show here that lexicographic beliefs lack the expressive power to model caution once we extend traditional games to psychological games. Quantification of the relation of ‘deeming an event infinitely more likely than another event’ is necessary, which can be accomplished by using non-standard beliefs.  
  Shuige Liu: Characterizing Assumption of Rationality by Incomplete Information  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 15 (2018)  
 Abstract:   
 We characterize common assumption of rationality of 2-person games within an incomplete information framework. We use the lexicographic model with incomplete information and show that a belief hierarchy expresses common assumption of rationality within a complete information framework if and only if there is a belief hierarchy within the corresponding incomplete information framework that expresses common full belief in caution, rationality, every good choice is supported, and prior belief in the original utility functions.  
  Shuige Liu: Characterizing Permissibility and Proper Rationalizability by Incomplete Information  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 14 (2018)  
 Abstract:   
 We characterize permissibility and proper rationalizability within an incomplete information framework. We define the lexicographic epistemic model for a game with incomplete information, and show that a choice is permissible (properly rationalizable) within a complete information framework if and only if it is optimal for a belief hierarchy within the corresponding incomplete information framework that expresses common full belief in caution, primary belief in the opponent’s utilities nearest to the original utilities (the opponent’s utilities are centered around the original utilities), and a best (better) choice is supported by utilities nearest (nearer) to the original ones.

 Andrés Perea: Common Belief in Rationality in Games with Unawareness  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 13 (2017)  
 Abstract:   
 This paper investigates static games with unawareness, where players may be unaware of some of the choices that can be made by other players. That is, different players may have different views on the game. We propose an epistemic model that encodes players’ belief hierarchies on choices and views, and use it to formulate the basic reasoning concept of common belief in rationality. We do so for two scenarios: one in which we do not fix the players’ belief hierarchies on views, and one in which we do. For both scenarios we design a recursive elimination procedure that yields for every possible view the choices that can rationally be made under common belief in rationality.  
  Niels Mourmans: Reasoning about the Surprise Exam Paradox: An Application of Psychological Game Theory  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 12 (2017)  
 Abstract:   
 In many real-life scenarios, decision-makers do not exclusively care for materialized outcomes from decisions they and their co-players make but also display other-regarding preferences such as reciprocity and surprise. Psychological game theory is able to model such belief-dependent motivations. In this paper we discuss the reasoning concepts of common belief in rationality and common belief in future rationality in a psychological game-theoretic setting and use them to provide an explanation for the puzzle of the Surprise Exam Paradox. We consider two versions of the surprise exam game, both in a static and dynamic scenario. In the version that best captures the actual crux of the paradox, we show that, as long as no cautious reasoning is imposed, full surprise is always possible. This contrasts the previous game-theoretic literature on the Surprise Exam Paradox, which relied on equilibrium concepts for traditional and psychological games alike and showed that at most partial surprise is possible under these concepts.  
  Christian Bach and Andrés Perea: Generalized Nash Equilibrium without Common Belief in Rationality  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 11 (2017)  
 Abstract:   
 This note considers generalized Nash equilibrium as an incomplete information analogue of Nash equilibrium and provides an epistemic characterization of it. It is shown that the epistemic conditions do not imply common belief in rationality. For the special case of complete information, an epistemic characterization of Nash equilibrium ensues as a corollary.  
  Stephan Jagau and Andrés Perea: Common belief in rationality in psychological games  ,  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 10 (2017)  
 Abstract:   
 Belief-dependent motivations and emotional mechanisms such as surprise, anxiety, anger, guilt, and intention-based reciprocity pervade real-life human interaction. At the same time, traditional game theory has experienced huge difficulties trying to capture them adequately. Psychological game theory, initially introduced by Geanakoplos et al. (1989), has proven to be a useful modeling framework for these and many more psychological phenomena. In this paper, we use the epistemic approach to psychological games to systematically study common belief in rationality, also known as correlated rationalizability. We show that common belief in rationality is possible in any game that preserves rationality at infinity, a mild requirement that is considerably weaker than the previously known continuity conditions from Geanakoplos et al. (1989) and Battigalli and Dufwenberg (2009). Also, we provide an example showing that common belief in rationality might be impossible in games where rationality is not preserved at infinity. We then develop an iterative procedure that, for a given psychological game, determines all rationalizable choices. In addition, we explore classes of psychological games that allow for a simplified procedure.  
  Christian Bach and Andrés Perea: Incomplete Information and Equilibrium  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 9 (2017)  
 Abstract:   
 In games with incomplete information Bayesian equilibrium constitutes the prevailing solution concept. We show that Bayesian equilibrium generalizes correlated equilibrium from complete to incomplete information. In particular, we provide an epistemic characterization of Bayesian equilibrium as well as of correlated equilibrium in terms of common belief in rationality and a common prior. Bayesian equilibrium is thus not the incomplete information counterpart of Nash equilibrium. To fill the resulting gap, we introduce the solution concept of generalized Nash equilibrium as the incomplete information analogue to Nash equilibrium, and show that it is more restrictive than Bayesian equilibrium. Besides, we propose a simplified tool to compute Bayesian equilibria.  
  Andrés Perea: Order Independence in Dynamic Games  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 8 (2017)  
 Abstract:   
 In this paper we investigate the order independence of iterated reduction procedures in dynamic games. We distinguish between two types of order independence: with respect to strategies and with respect to outcomes. The first states that the specific order of elimination chosen should not affect the final set of strategy combinations, whereas the second states that it should not affect the final set of reachable outcomes in the game. We provide sufficient conditions for both types of order independence: monotonicity, and monotonicity on reachable histories, respectively.  
  We use these sufficient conditions to explore the order independence properties of various reduction procedures in dynamic games: the extensive-form rationalizability procedure (Pearce (1984), Battigalli (1997)), the backward dominance procedure (Perea (2014)) and Battigalli and Siniscalchi’s (1999) procedure for jointly rational belief systems (Reny (1993)). We finally exploit these results to prove that every outcome that is reachable under the extensive-form rationalizability procedure is also reachable under the backward dominance procedure.

 Christian Bach and Andrés Perea: Incomplete Information and Generalized Iterated Strict Dominance  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 7 (2016)  
 Abstract:   
 In games with incomplete information, players face uncertainty about the opponents’ utility functions. We follow Harsanyi’s (1967-68) one-person perspective approach to modelling incomplete information. Moreover, our formal framework is kept as basic and parsimonious as possible, to render the theory of incomplete information accessible to a broad spectrum of potential applications. In particular, we formalize common belief in rationality and provide an algorithmic characterization of it in terms of decision problems, which gives rise to the non-equilibrium solution concept of generalized iterated strict dominance.

 Christian Nauerz and Andrés Perea: Local Prior Expected Utility: a basis for utility representations under uncertainty  , EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 6 (2015)  
 Abstract:   
 Abstract Models of decision-making under ambiguity are widely used in economics. One stream of such models results from weakening the independence axiom in Anscombe et al. (1963). We identify necessary assumptions on independence to represent the decision maker’s preferences such that he acts as if he maximizes expected utility with respect to a possibly local prior. We call the resulting representation Local Prior Expected Utility, and show that the prior used to evaluate a certain act can be obtained by computing the gradient of some appropriately defined utility mapping. The numbers in the gradient, moreover, can naturally be interpreted as the subjective likelihoods the decision maker assigns to the various states. Building on this result we provide a unified approach to the representation results of Maximin Expected Utility and Choquet Expected Utility and characterize the respective sets of priors.  
  Andrés Perea: Forward Induction Reasoning versus Equilibrium Reasoning  EPICENTER  Working Paper No. 5 (2015)  
 Abstract:   
 In the literature on static and dynamic games, most rationalizability concepts have an equilibrium counterpart  . In two-player games, the equilibrium counterpart is obtained by taking the associated rationalizability concept and adding the following correct beliefs assumption  : (a) a player believes that the opponent is correct about his beliefs, and (b) a player believes that the opponent believes that he is correct about the opponent’s beliefs. This paper shows that there is no equilibrium counterpart to the forward induction concept of extensive-form rationalizability  (Pearce (1984), Battigalli (1997)), epistemically characterized by common strong belief in rationality  (Battigalli and Siniscalchi (2002)). The reason is that there are games where the epistemic conditions of common strong belief in rationality are logically inconsistent with the correct beliefs assumption. In fact, we show that this inconsistency holds for “most” dynamic games of interest.  
  Andrés Perea and Elias Tsakas: Local Reasoning in Dynamic Games  EPICENTER  Working Paper No.4 (2015)  
 Abstract:   
 In this paper we introduce a novel framework for modeling the players’ reasoning in a dynamic game: at each history each active player reasons about her opponents’ rationality at certain histories only  . As a result we obtain a generalized solution concept, called local common strong belief in rationality  , and we characterize the strategy profiles that can be rationally played under our concept by means of a simple elimination procedure. Finally, we show that standard models of reasoning can be embedded as special cases on our framework. In particular, the forward induction concept of common strong belief in rationality  (Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2002) is a special case of our model with the players reasoning about all histories, whereas the backward induction concept of common belief in future rationality  (Perea, 2014) is a special case of our model with the players reasoning about future histories only.  
  2014:   
 Andrés Perea and Arkadi Predtetchinski: An Epistemic Approach to Stochastic Games  EPICENTER  Working Paper No.3 (2014)  
 Abstract:   
 In this paper we focus on stochastic games with finitely many states and actions. For this setting we study the epistemic concept of common belief in future rationality, which is based on the condition that players always believe that their opponents will choose rationally in the future. We distinguish two different versions of the concept — one for the discounted case with a fixed discount factor δ, and one for the case of uniform optimality, where optimality is required for “all discount factors close enough to 1”. We show that both versions of common belief in future rationality always yield non-empty predictions for every stochastic game. This is in sharp contrast with the non-existence of subgame perfect equilibrium in many stochastic games under the uniform optimality criterion. We also provide an epistemic characterization of subgame perfect equilibrium for 2-player stochastic games, showing that it is essentially equivalent to common belief in future rationality together with some “correct beliefs assumption”. We finally present a recursive procedure to compute the set of stationary strategies that can be chosen by certain simple types under common belief in future rationality.  
  Christian Nauerz: Understanding reasoning in games using utility proportional beliefs  EPICENTER  Working Paper No.2 (2014)  
 Abstract:   
 Traditionally very little attention has been paid to the reasoning process that underlies a game theoretic solution concept. When modeling bounded rationality in one-shot games, however, the reasoning process can be a great source of insight. The reasoning process itself can provide testable assertions, which provide more insight than the fit to experimental data. Based on Bach and Perea’s (2014) concept of utility proportional beliefs, I analyze the players’ reasoning process and find three testable implications: (1) Players form an initial belief that is the basis for further reasoning. (2) Players reason by alternatingly considering their own and their opponent’s incentives. (3) Players perform only several rounds of deliberate reasoning.  
  Andrés Perea: When Do Types Induce the Same Belief Hierarchy?  EPICENTER  Working Paper No.1 (2014)  
 Abstract:   
 Harsanyi (1967–1968) showed how infinite belief hierarchies can be encoded by means of type structures. Such encodings, however, are far from unique: Two different types — possibly from two different type structures — may generate exactly the same belief hierarchy. In this paper we present a finite recursive procedure, the Type Partitioning Procedure  , which verifies whether two types, from two potentially different finite type structures, induce the same belief hierarchy or not. Important is that the procedure does not make explicit reference to belief hierarchies, but operates entirely within the “language” of type structures. In the second part of this paper we relate the procedure to the notion of type morphisms and hierarchy morphisms between type structures.

 About 
  Call for Papers 
  Technical Debt stands as a pivotal metaphor in the realm of software evolution, representing development shortcuts taken for expediency that cause the degradation of internal software quality. A critical element of the technical debt metaphor is its ability to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders within software development teams. The International Conference on Technical Debt (TechDebt) is the flagship conference dedicated to discuss how to identify, address, and manage technical debt in software projects. This premier event unites leading researchers and practitioners in software engineering to explore diverse strategies for managing various forms of technical debt, share experiences and best practices, and identify the most pressing challenges faced by both industry and academia.  
 The 8th International Conference on Technical Debt will be held in April 2025 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. As the previous editions, TechDebt will be co-located with the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025).

This premier event unites leading researchers and practitioners in software engineering to explore diverse strategies for managing various forms of technical debt, share experiences and best practices, and identify the most pressing challenges faced by both industry and academia.  
 The 8th International Conference on Technical Debt will be held in April 2025 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. As the previous editions, TechDebt will be co-located with the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025).  
 Topics   
 The TechDebt conference warmly invites research and practical contributions to its Technical Track. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Investigations on Specific Technical Debt Types   
 Specific technical debt types (e.g., test debt, build debt, architectural debt) 
  Less studied kinds of technical debt (e.g., requirement, documentation, security debt) 
  Other types of debt (e.g., social debt, process debt) 
  Debt in specific domains (e.g., AI-based systems, mobile applications) 
  Case Studies and Practical Experiences   
 Case studies on successful and unsuccessful technical debt management practices 
  Case studies on the remediation of technical debt in real-world projects 
  Experiences from industry on managing and paying down technical debt 
  Empirical evidence on the effectiveness of technical debt management tools and approaches 
  Tools and Approaches for Managing Technical Debt   
 Tools, demos, and libraries to identify, assess, and manage technical debt 
  Methods and frameworks for identifying, monitoring, and managing technical debt 
  Decision frameworks for prioritizing debt items against features and other debts 
  Estimation of technical debt principal and interest 
  Quality assurance practices to minimize and address technical debt 
  Human and Organizational Factors   
 Human factors in managing technical debt (e.g., team dynamics, communication challenges) 
  Stakeholder perspectives and concerns about technical debt 
  The impact of organizational culture and processes on technical debt accumulation and repayment 
  Emerging Trends in Technical Debt Research   
 Use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for technical debt management 
  Software visualization techniques for technical debt identification and monitoring 
  New trends in technical debt for AI-driven systems and mobile applications 
  The role of software economics in shaping technical debt decisions 
  Position and Vision Papers   
 Position and vision papers offering novel perspectives on technical debt 
  New conceptual frameworks and metrics to study technical debt and its evolution 
  Paper categories   
 We invite submissions of papers to the Technical Track in any areas related to the theme and goal of the conference in the following categories:  
 Research Papers (up to 10 pages, plus 2 pages for references only) | : Innovative and significant original research in the field 
  Experience Papers (up to 10 pages, plus 2 pages for references only) | : Experiences, case studies, challenges, problems, and solutions gathered from industrial contexts. 
  Short Papers (up to 5 pages, plus 2 pages for references only) | : Early stages of research, new ideas, visions, and/or reflections; or technical debt-related tools. 
  All submissions must not exceed their page limit for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF.  
 Upon acceptance, papers will be included in the 8th International Conference on Technical Debt proceedings.  
 Evaluation criteria   
 Submissions must be original and unpublished work. Each paper submitted to the main Technical Track will undergo a rigorous review process by at least three members of the program committee.  
 Novelty | : The novelty and innovativeness of contributed solutions, problem formulations, methodologies, theories, and/or evaluations, i.e., the extent to which the paper is sufficiently original with respect to the state-of-the-art. 
  Rigor | : The soundness, clarity, and depth of a technical or theoretical contribution, and the level of thoroughness and completeness of an evaluation. 
  Relevance | : The significance and/or potential impact of the research on the field of software engineering. 
  Verifiability and Transparency | : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how an innovation works; to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted; and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. Any artifacts attached to or linked from the paper will be checked by one reviewer. 
  Presentation | : The clarity of the exposition in the paper. 
  Reviewers will carefully consider all of the above criteria during the review process, and authors should take great care in clearly addressing them all. The paper should clearly explain and justify the claimed contributions. The weighting and relevance of the above criteria vary for paper types, e.g., a vision paper is primarily evaluated on novelty and relevance and not verifiability.  
 Junior PC   
 TechDebt 2025 proudly introduces a Junior Program Committee (Junior PC), which operates alongside the main program committee to enhance the review process and mentor the next generation of researchers. Composed of early-career scholars, the Junior PC reviews a subset of papers under the guidance of experienced mentors. The feedback they provide offers additional input to authors, enriching the TechDebt review process while ensuring high-quality reviews and supporting the growth of future leaders in the field of technical debt.  
 Submission process   
 TechDebt 2025 uses a doubly anonymous reviewing model for the Technical Track. Therefore, all submissions to this track have to fulfill the doubly-anonymous reviewing requirements  (refer to the ICSE Q&A  for more details). Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk-rejected without further review.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically via the TechDebtConf2025 HotCRP site.  
 Submission site  : https://techdebt2025.hotcrp.com  .  
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc  or compsocconf  options).  
 Link: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 Open Science policy   
 Openness in science is key to fostering progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. While all submissions will undergo the same review process independent of whether or not they disclose their analysis code or data, we strongly encourage authors to make data available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and especially upon acceptance (publicly). If the authors cannot disclose industrial or otherwise non-public data, they should provide an explicit (short) statement in the paper.  
 Accepted papers and attendance expectations   
 After acceptance, the list of paper authors cannot be changed under any circumstances, and the list of authors on camera-ready papers must be identical to those on submitted papers. After acceptance, paper titles can not be changed except by permission of the Program Co-Chairs, and only then when referees recommend a change for clarity or accuracy with paper content.  
 If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for TechDebt 2025 and present the paper.  
 Important dates   
 Abstract deadline: Nov 8, 2024 
  Paper deadline: Nov 15, 2024 
  Author notification: Jan 10, 2025 
  Camera ready deadline: Jan 31, 2025 
  Mentoring Program   
 Authors can make use of the Mentoring Program  to offer mentorship to help bring new researchers to the community and assist those who would like to improve their papers by getting independent advice to ensure that papers are consistent with the existing technical debt body of work, focus on critical open challenges, and are accessible to everyone. Check out the Mentoring Program here  .

 Motivation   
 Technical Debt stands as a pivotal metaphor in the realm of software evolution, representing development shortcuts taken for expediency that cause the degradation of internal software quality. A critical element of the technical debt metaphor is its ability to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders within software development teams.

  Paper categories   
 We invite submissions of papers to the Technical Track in any areas related to the theme and goal of the conference in the following categories:  
 Research Papers (up to 10 pages, plus 2 pages for references only) | : Innovative and significant original research in the field 
  Experience Papers (up to 10 pages, plus 2 pages for references only) | : Experiences, case studies, challenges, problems, and solutions gathered from industrial contexts. 
  Short Papers (up to 5 pages, plus 2 pages for references only) | : Early stages of research, new ideas, visions, and/or reflections; or technical debt-related tools. 
  All submissions must not exceed their page limit for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF.  
 Upon acceptance, papers will be included in the 8th International Conference on Technical Debt proceedings.  
 Evaluation criteria   
 Submissions must be original and unpublished work. Each paper submitted to the main Technical Track will undergo a rigorous review process by at least three members of the program committee.  
 Novelty | : The novelty and innovativeness of contributed solutions, problem formulations, methodologies, theories, and/or evaluations, i.e., the extent to which the paper is sufficiently original with respect to the state-of-the-art. 
  Rigor | : The soundness, clarity, and depth of a technical or theoretical contribution, and the level of thoroughness and completeness of an evaluation. 
  Relevance | : The significance and/or potential impact of the research on the field of software engineering. 
  Verifiability and Transparency | : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how an innovation works; to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted; and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. Any artifacts attached to or linked from the paper will be checked by one reviewer. 
  Presentation | : The clarity of the exposition in the paper. 
  Reviewers will carefully consider all of the above criteria during the review process, and authors should take great care in clearly addressing them all. The paper should clearly explain and justify the claimed contributions. The weighting and relevance of the above criteria vary for paper types, e.g., a vision paper is primarily evaluated on novelty and relevance and not verifiability.  
 Junior PC   
 TechDebt 2025 proudly introduces a Junior Program Committee (Junior PC), which operates alongside the main program committee to enhance the review process and mentor the next generation of researchers. Composed of early-career scholars, the Junior PC reviews a subset of papers under the guidance of experienced mentors. The feedback they provide offers additional input to authors, enriching the TechDebt review process while ensuring high-quality reviews and supporting the growth of future leaders in the field of technical debt.  
 Submission process   
 TechDebt 2025 uses a doubly anonymous reviewing model for the Technical Track. Therefore, all submissions to this track have to fulfill the doubly-anonymous reviewing requirements  (refer to the ICSE Q&A  for more details). Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk-rejected without further review.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically via the TechDebtConf2025 HotCRP site.  
 Submission site  : https://techdebt2025.hotcrp.com  .  
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc  or compsocconf  options).  
 Link: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 Open Science policy   
 Openness in science is key to fostering progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. While all submissions will undergo the same review process independent of whether or not they disclose their analysis code or data, we strongly encourage authors to make data available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and especially upon acceptance (publicly). If the authors cannot disclose industrial or otherwise non-public data, they should provide an explicit (short) statement in the paper.  
 Accepted papers and attendance expectations   
 After acceptance, the list of paper authors cannot be changed under any circumstances, and the list of authors on camera-ready papers must be identical to those on submitted papers. After acceptance, paper titles can not be changed except by permission of the Program Co-Chairs, and only then when referees recommend a change for clarity or accuracy with paper content.  
 If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for TechDebt 2025 and present the paper.

 Call for Proposals for holding future TCCs  
 We are seeking organizers for future TCCs. Would you like to be one? If so, please let the steering committee know of your interest ASAP by notifying shaih AT alum DOT mit DOT edu  . It will be useful if you provide as much as possible of the following information (but this can wait for a later stage): Proposed general chair: The person organizing the conference gets this job. 
  Proposed location: city, country 
  Propose venue (university, hotel, other) 
  Proposed dates (try to avoid | Friday and Saturday | ) 
  Facilities: Is there auditorium style seating? How many persons does the room accommodate? 
  Cost: Could you roughly estimate the cost for hotel and facilities? 
  Years: Let us know whether your proposal can be carried over into future years if not selected for the next year. 
  Indeed, we will need the aforementioned information at a later stage (i.e., at the time we choose the location), but Shai will let you know of our needs for these details in due time. We typically want to make a decision for TCC N  a few months ahead of TCC N-1  . Current status  : The location of TCC'14 has been determined. Currently, the next proposal we seek is for TCC'15. If you'd like to make a proposition for TCC'15 or a later year please send Shai an initial email. Detailed proposals would be sought at a later stage.  
 Preferred dates  : Our default is to hold TCC between mid February and early March with preference to mid February. However, deviation (as per local constraints) have occurred (see history table below).  
 History:  For your information, here is how the TCC calendar has looked so far:  

 Year | Dates | Location | General Chair(s)

  Welcome to the website of the FormaliSE 2019 conference!  
 The software industry has a long-standing and well-earned reputation for failing to deliver high-quality software. Much progress has been achieved from the early days of software development; still, nowadays, even considering the state of the art of the technologies used, the success of software projects is often not guaranteed. Many of the approaches used for developing large, complex software system are still not able to ensure the correct behavior – and the general quality – of the delivered product, despite the efforts of the (often very qualified and skilled) software engineers involved. This is where formal methods can play a significant role. Indeed, they have been developed to provide the means for greater precision and thoroughness in modeling, reasoning about, validating, and documenting the various aspects of software systems during their development. When carefully applied, formal methods can aid all aspects of software creation: user requirement formulation, design, implementation, verification/testing, and the creation of documentation.  
 However, after decades of research, and despite significant advancement, formal methods are still not widely used in industrial software development. We believe that a closer integration of formal methods in software engineering can help increase the quality of software applications, and at the same time highlight the benefits of formal methods in terms also of the generated return on investment (ROI).  
 The main objective of the conference is to foster the integration between the formal methods and the software engineering communities, to strengthen the – still too weak – links between them, and to stimulate researchers to share ideas, techniques, and results, with the ultimate goal to propose novel solutions to the fraught problem of improving the quality of software systems.  
 Originally a successful satellite workshop of ICSE, since 2018 FormaliSE is organised as a 1-day conference co-located with ICSE. FormaliSE 2019 will take place on May 27th, 2019, in Montreal, Canada.

 TACAS 2025  
 31st International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems  
   
 Scope  
 TACAS is a forum for researchers, developers and users interested in rigorously based tools and algorithms for the construction and analysis of systems.  
   
 The conference aims to bridge the gaps between different communities with this common interest and to support them in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, flexibility and efficiency of tools and algorithms for building systems.  
 Theoretical papers with clear relevance for tool construction and analysis as well as tool descriptions and case studies with a conceptual message are all encouraged. The topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to:  
 specification and verification techniques; 
  software and hardware verification; 
  analytical techniques for real-time, hybrid, or stochastic systems; 
  analytical techniques for safety, security, or dependability; 
  SAT and SMT solving; 
  theorem proving; 
  model checking; 
  static and dynamic program analysis; 
  testing; 
  abstraction techniques for modeling and verification; 
  compositional and refinement-based methodologies; 
  system construction and transformation techniques; 
  machine-learning techniques for synthesis and verification; 
  tool environments and tool architectures; 
  applications and case studies. 

 Important Dates  
   
 The important dates are available in the Joint Call for Papers  .  

 Submission Categories  
   
 TACAS accepts four types of submissions: research papers, case-study papers, regular tool papers, and tool demonstration papers.  
 Research Papers  identify and justify a principled advance to the theoretical foundations for the construction and analysis of systems. Where applicable, they are supported by experimental validation. Artifact evaluation for regular research papers is not mandatory but strongly encouraged.  
 We do not discourage authors of regular research papers to put their submission on arXiv (or similar repos). Yet, we strongly encourage authors to not put the work on arXiv (or similar repos) around 2 weeks before and after the submission deadline, because potential reviewers may be subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers.  
 Case-Study Papers  are full length case-studies that describe the application of techniques developed by the community to a single problem or a set of problems of practical importance, preferably in a real-world setting. Case-study papers must describe the problem of interest and its novelty. It must provide a detailed description of the case-study (or studies) and various related techniques to solve the problem of interest for the case-study application. Modeling aspects of the case-study must be discussed. The case-study paper must provide detailed results on the application of formal techniques and lead to a conclusion that could be of interest beyond TACAS (to the research community pertaining to the case study). Artifact evaluation is currently not mandatory for case-study papers but undergoing artifact evaluation is strongly encouraged.  
 Regular Tool Papers  are full length papers that describe a tool of interest to the community or a new version of the tool built using novel algorithmic and engineering techniques. Regular tool papers must describe tools of broad interest and utility to the TACAS community. The papers must clearly describe the problem to be solved, its importance, related work, the techniques used in the tool and their novelty, the construction of the tool, its unique features, discuss how the tool is used and present benchmarking of the tool including comparisons with other tools and previous versions of the tool. For tools from the industry, the description should be useful in allowing the community members to reproduce some of the key techniques or “tricks” in their own tools. All tool papers must undergo mandatory artifact evaluation.  
 Tool-Demonstration Papers  are short papers that demonstrate a new tool or application of existing tool on a significant and novel case-study. As such, tool demo papers will be accepted if the PC decides that they are sufficiently interesting and novel to the community. Artifact evaluation is mandatory for these papers.  

 Paper Submission  
 Submit paper   
   
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS  (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of TACAS 2025  .  
 The review process of TACAS 2025 is:  
 double-blind | for regular research papers. As such, authors of regular research papers must omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them. 
  single-blind | for case study papers, regular tool papers, and tool-demonstration papers. 
  The length  of regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers is limited to 16 pp llncs.cls (excluding the bibliography and appendices). The length of tool demonstration papers is limited to 6 pp llncs.cls (excluding the bibliography and appendices). Additional material can be placed in a clearly marked appendix, at the end of the paper. The reviewers are, however, not obliged to read such appendices. If the paper is accepted, a full version including the appendix should be made publicly available via arXiv or a similar platform.  
 TACAS 2025 allows at most four submissions per author.   
 Submissions not adhering to the formatting and length requirements specified above will be rejected immediately.   

 Conflict of Interest  
   
 Upon paper submission, authors are asked to declare their Conflict of Interest (COI) with TACAS 2025 PC members. A COI includes the following sources:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes author a favour (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent or recent collaborator (within last 5 years) cannot objectively review your work. If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a COI not listed above, then the author can contact TACAS 2025 PC chairs. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If an author is uncertain of COI, the author is encouraged to email TACAS 2025 PC chairs. 

 Paper Evaluation  
   
 All papers will be evaluated by the program committee (PC), coordinated by the PC chairs and aided by the artifact evaluation chairs. All papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity.  
 Reproducibility of results is of the utmost importance for TACAS. Therefore, we encourage all authors to include support for replicating the results of their papers. For theorems, this would mean providing proofs; for algorithms, this would mean including evidence of correctness and acceptable performance, either by a theoretical analysis or by experimentation; and for experiments, one should provide access to the artifacts used to generate the experimental data. Material that does not fit into the paper page limit may be provided as appendix and/or on a supplementary website (without violating double-blind submission requirements of regular research papers), with access appropriately enabled and license rights made clear. For example, the supplemental material for reviewing case-study papers and papers with experimental results could be classified as reviewer-confidential if necessary (e.g. if proprietary data are investigated or software is not open source).  
 TACAS 2025 will use rebuttal for selected submissions  (those in the grey zone).  

 Artifact Evaluation  
   
 TACAS 2025 implements mandatory artifact evaluation for regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions  . Authors of these submissions must submit the respective artifacts by October 24, 2024 (AoE). The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 TACAS 2025 also implements a voluntary artifact evaluation for regular paper and case study paper submissions  . Authors of these submissions are encouraged to submit their respective artifacts. The artifacts will be evaluated post-paper-acceptance, provided the submission has been accepted as a regular paper or case study paper at TACAS 2025. Authors of accepted regular/case-study papers may revise/submit their artifact for evaluation shortly (in one week time and not longer than January 9, 2025) after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the voluntary artifact evaluation will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 Details on artifacts and their evaluation criteria  are available on the artifacts page  .  

 Artifact Submission  
   
 Artifact submission is handled via EasyChair  . After the paper submission deadline, the paper submission will be copied by us from the main track to the artifact evaluation track. In this track, you should amend your submission’s abstract and upload a ZIP archive containing your artifact. Do not attempt to create a new submission, nor change your submission’s other details such as authors or title. Because of this copying process, you can upload or update your artefact either in the main track before the paper submission deadline or in the AE track during a window before the deadline. The TACAS PC or AEC chairs will inform authors when the AE track is open for different paper categories.

31 st  International Symposium on   
  Temporal Representation   
  and Reasoning   
  Oct. 28–30, 2024   
    
 Montpellier, France   

 Dates | Program | Registration | Organization | Venue 
  
 Introduction  
 TIME has been for more than twenty years the only yearly multidisciplinary international event dedicated to the topic of time in computer science. The purpose of the symposium is to bring together active researchers in different research areas involving temporal representation and reasoning. The symposium also welcomes research papers on the related topics of spatial and spatio-temporal representation and reasoning. In the early years, most contributions came from the Artificial Intelligence community, but the number of contributions from other areas such as Temporal Logic and Verification and partly from Temporal Databases has been increasing in the last years.  
 More details about TIME and the previous editions of this symposium can be found via the following link: https://time-symposium.org/  .  
 Call For Papers

 In this symposium, in addition to theoretical and practical work in Artificial Intelligence  , Databases  , and Logic and Reasoning  , we invite submissions focusing on the development, deployment, and evaluation of Machine Learning Systems  that fall under the scope of the symposium. Such systems papers will be evaluated primarily on the quality of the empirical evaluation and reusability. Topics for TIME 2024 include (but are not limited to):  
 Spatial and temporal reasoning 
  Time in natural language processing 
  Reasoning about action and change 
  Complex event recognition and forecasting 
  Planning and planning languages 
  Ontologies of time and space-time 
  Belief and uncertainty in temporal knowledge 
  Temporal learning and discovery 
  Temporal data models and query languages 
  Temporal query processing and indexing 
  Temporal data mining 
  Stream data management 
  Spatio-temporal data management, including moving objects 
  Data currency and expiration 
  Indeterminate and imprecise temporal data 
  Temporal constraints 
  Specification and verification of systems 
  Verification of software and web applications 
  Synthesis and execution 
  Model checking algorithms and implementations 
  Temporal logics for infinite-state systems 
  Runtime verification of temporal properties 
  Temporal aspects of agent- and policy-based systems 
  Temporal networks 
  Temporal argumentation frameworks 
  Automata-theoretic techniques for temporal reasoning 
  Temporal knowledge graphs 
  Time-series data management 
  Events and time series explanations in healthcare 
  The list above is by no means exhaustive, as the aim is to foster the debate around all aspects of the suggested topics.  
 Finally, the authors of the top-ranked papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their contribution to a special issue  in the journal of Information and Computation  ; more details will be provided in due time.  
 Submission  
 The submission link is available at  cmt3.research.microsoft.com/TIME2024/  .  
 Guidelines  
 TIME 2024 accepts submissions in PDF format, no longer than 12 pages excluding references and appendix. The appendix is limited to 5 pages, and the reviewers may or may not take it into account for their recommendation. Submissions must be formatted following the LIPIcs instructions  and preferably redacted in LaTeX.

 Region 10 Director’s Message - January 2024  
   
    Video Tour    Lance Fung   
 Happy New Year to all IEEE members and families!  
   
  No other species celebrates with the passage of time, having the ability to reflect, set goals and have a positive outlook for the future! We should be grateful that we are capable to celebrate every New Year.  
  Just like celebrating New Years, we choose to be members and volunteers of IEEE, because we can, because we believe, and because we agree to advance the mission and vision of IEEE, for the benefit of humanity!  
  At this moment, my term as the IEEE Region 10 Director is at half time, and I am on my way to complete my service in the next 12 months.  
  I take this time to reflect, set goals and express my hope for positive change for the Region.

 Introduction  
 TIME has been for more than twenty years the only yearly multidisciplinary international event dedicated to the topic of time in computer science. The purpose of the symposium is to bring together active researchers in different research areas involving temporal representation and reasoning. The symposium also welcomes research papers on the related topics of spatial and spatio-temporal representation and reasoning. In the early years, most contributions came from the Artificial Intelligence community, but the number of contributions from other areas such as Temporal Logic and Verification and partly from Temporal Databases has been increasing in the last years.  
 More details about TIME and the previous editions of this symposium can be found via the following link: https://time-symposium.org/  .

 Guidelines  
 TIME 2024 accepts submissions in PDF format, no longer than 12 pages excluding references and appendix. The appendix is limited to 5 pages, and the reviewers may or may not take it into account for their recommendation. Submissions must be formatted following the LIPIcs instructions  and preferably redacted in LaTeX.  
 TIME policy is single blind, so the names of the authors need not be hidden in the submitted draft. Members of the program committee are allowed to submit papers. Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness, originality, and relevance to the symposium.  
 Submissions to TIME 2024 must be original; parallel submissions of the same material to other conferences or journals are not allowed. At least one author of each accepted paper must register at the symposium and present the paper.  
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to the organizers.

 ABOUT ETAPS  
 ETAPS is a primary forum for academic and industrial researchers working on topics relating to software science. ETAPS, established in 1998, is a confederation of four annual conferences accompanied by satellite workshops. ETAPS 2025 is the twenty-eighth event in the series.  
 Why choose ETAPS?  
 ETAPS is one of the world’s leading fora for research on software science, with a history of more than 25 years. 
  The proceedings of ETAPS appear in gold open access, with no article processing charge for the authors specifically. 
  All constituent conferences provide artifact evaluation. 
  In addition to the conference, ETAPS also unites the software science community with activities such as a blog on software science, a PhD workshop, sessions on diversity and inclusion and an ask-me-anything session. 
  Poster and Tool demo sessions are organized over the week. 
  Spin Symposium and Rust Verification Workshop are colocated with ETAPS again. 
  What is new in 2025?

The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors.  
 AWARDS  
 The strongest papers from the four conferences will be marked as distinguished papers and highlighted in the conference program. From these distinguished papers, the EAPLS, EASST, and EATCS, and the Best Tool Paper Award committees will select the best ETAPS papers.  
 The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  
 The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  
 The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.  
 All distinguished papers will be highlighted in the program.  
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States.
