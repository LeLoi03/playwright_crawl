 About MEDES 2024    

 In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and exponential use of digital components leads to the emergence of intelligent environments namely “digital ecosystems” connected to the web and composed of multiple and independent entities such as individuals, organizations, services, software and applications sharing one or several missions and focusing on the interactions and inter-relationships among them.  
 With the help of the computational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties (such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its “digital components”, in which resources provided by each entity are properly conserved, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehend big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* properties platforms.  
 Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are highly complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as big data management, web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.  
 The International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES) aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and industry interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to web technologies and resource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to this end. The conference seeks related original research papers, industrial papers and proposals for demonstrations, and tutorials and workshops.  
 The conference is In collaboration with ACM SIGAPP and the Proceedings will be published and indexed by Springer CCIS  .  

 Special Issues  
 Selected presented papers will be invited for submission to two Special Issues:  
 WWW Journal | (Impact factor: 3.0 – Rank: Q1) 
  SN Computer Science | (Impact factor: 3.78 – Rank: Q2)

 In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and exponential use of digital components leads to the emergence of intelligent environments namely « digital ecosystems » connected to the web and composed of multiple and independent entities such as individuals, organizations, services, software and applications sharing one or several missions and focusing on the interactions and inter-relationships among them.  
 With the help of the computational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties (such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its « digital components », in which resources provided by each entity are properly conserved, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehend big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* properties platforms.  
    
 Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are highly complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as big data management, web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resources.  
 The International Conference on ManagEment of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES)  , previously named « The International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems », aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and industry interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to web technologies and resource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to this end. The conference seeks related original research papers, industrial papers and proposals for demonstrations, and tutorials and workshops.  
 The conference Proceedings will be published and indexed by the ACM Digital Library  and DBLP  .

 Content and Educational Aims  
 The module introduces students to the mathematical foundations of computer science. Students learn to reason logically and clearly. They acquire the skill to formalize arguments and to prove propositions mathematically using elementary logic. Students are also introduced to fundamental concepts of graph theory and elementary graph algorithms.  
 After establishing the concept of algorithms, the first part covers basic elements of discrete mathematics, leading to Boolean algebra propositional logic, and predicate logic. Students learn how to use fundamental proof techniques to prove (or disprove) simple propositions. The second part of the module introduces students to basic concepts of algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields and different structure preserving maps (homomorphisms). Students study how these abstract concepts relate to problems in computer science. The last part of the module covers the basic elements of graph theory and the different representation of graphs. Elementary graph algorithms are introduced that have a wide range of applicability in computer science.  

 Intended Learning Outcomes  
 By the end of this module, students will be able to  
 explain basic concepts and properties of algorithms; 
  understand the concept of termination and complexity metrics; 
  illustrate basic concepts of discrete math (sets, relations, functions); 
  use basic proof techniques and apply them to prove properties of algorithms; 
  summarize basic principles of Boolean algebra and propositional logic; 
  use predicate logic and outline concepts such as validity and satisfiability; 
  distinguish abstract algebraic structures such as groups, rings and fields; 
  classify different structure preserving maps (homomorphisms); 
  understand calculations in finite fields and their applicability to computer science; 
  explain elementary concepts of graph theory and use different graph representations; 
  outline basic graph algorithms (e.g., traversal, search, spanning trees).

 Rules  
 The grade is determined by the final exam (100%). To attend the final exam, it is necessary to collect 50 points in weekly assignments. There are ten regular assignments and two bonus assignments during the semester and there is another bonus assignment before the second module exam. Each assignment is worth 10 points. Hence, students have to obtain 50/120 points during the semester to qualify for the first module exam or 50/130 points to qualify for the second module exam. Once a module achievement has been obtained, it remains valid for all subsequent module exams.  
 Electronic submission is the preferred way to hand in homework solutions. Please submit documents (plain ASCII/UTF-8 text or PDF no Word) and your source code (packed into a zip archive after removing all binaries and temporary files) via the online submission system. If you have problems, please contact one of the TAs. Solutions for assignments may need to be defended in an oral interview.  
 Late submissions will not be accepted. In case you are ill, you have to follow the procedures defined in the university policies to obtain an official excuse. If you obtain an excuse, the new deadline will be calculated as follows:  
 Determine the number of days you were excused until the deadline day, not counting excused weekend days. 
  Determine the day of the end of your excuse and add the number of day you obtained in first step. This gives you the initial new deadline. 
  If the period between the end of your excuse and the new deadline calculated in the second step includes weekend days, add them as well to the new deadline. (Iterate this step if necessary.) 
  For any questions stated on assignment sheets or exam sheets, we by default expect a reasoning for the answer given, unless explicitly stated otherwise.  
 Students must submit individual solutions. If you copy material verbatim from the Internet or other sources, you have to provide a proper reference. If we find your solution text on the Internet without a proper reference, you risk to lose your points. Any cheating cases will be reported to the registrar. In addition, you will lose the points (of course). These rules also apply to any generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT.  
 You are discouraged from using AI tools UNLESS under direct instruction from your instructor to do so. 
  If AI is permitted to be used, you must clearly state how AI was used in completing the assignments. No more than 25% of an assignment should be created with AI if the instructor gives permission for its use. 
  Note that the material generated by these programs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise problematic. Their use may also stifle your own independent thinking and creativity. Accordingly, reduction in the grade is likely when using AI. Rather use your own brain. 
  Any programs, which have to be written, will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 correctness including proper handling of error conditions 
  proper use of programming language constructs 
  clarity of the program organization and design 
  readability of the source code and any output produced 
  Source code must be accompanied by a README file providing an overview of the source files and giving instructions how to build the programs. A suitable Makefile (of CMakeLists.txt) is required if the build process involves more than a single source file. Source files must be submitted in a format understood by compilers.  
 If any part of these rules are confusing or uncertain, please reach out to your instructor for a conversation before submitting your work.  
 If you are unhappy with the grading, please report immediately (within one week) to the TAs. If you can't resolve things, contact the instructor. Problem reports which come late, that is after the one-week period, are not considered anymore.

   Large-scale Internet Measurements (2012-2019)  
 Large-scale measurement platforms such as RIPE Atlas or Sam Knows have been developed in order to measure the performance of the Internet from a wide variety of endpoints. A key goal is to estimate the service quality delivered to customers and to identify problems impacting the service quality. In the context of large scale Internet measurements, we have been working on the following topics:  
 Standardization of measurement control protocols (LMAP) 
  Measurement of the impact of the transition to IPv6 
  Measurement of access network (last-mile) characteristics

   Flow-based Network Traffic Analysis (2007-2017)  
 We are interested in understanding how real-world networks behave. Since packet inspection does not scale, we are primarily looking into the analysis of aggregated traffic flows. We are working both on base technology for processing large amounts of flow records and its application for identifying applications and users based on their specific flow signatures. Our work has covered the following topics:  
 Cybermetrics – user identification based on flow records 
  Detection of application signatures in flow records 
  Stream-based flow query processing 
  Trace animation and visualization

   Protocols for the Internet of Things (2008-2016)  
 The Internet is streching out into everyday objects. There is a large potential in networking everyday things and some people even believe that smart objects are helping to solve our energy consumption problems (by enabling smart power grids). In the context of the Internet of Things, we have been working on the following topics:  
 6LoWPAN implementation and interoperability testing 
  SNMP on constrained devices 
  NETCONF on constrained devices 
  Evaluation of attacks on the RPL routing protocol 
  Development of MIB modules for 6LoWPAN and RPL

   Network Protocol Security (2006-2011)  
 The Internet developed from a research network into a basic utility of today’s society and the global economy. While in the early days security did not play a major role in the design of protocols, the state of things has changed completely. While the use of cryptographic algorithms to protect protocols is meanwhile reasonably well understood, the biggest problem remains the interface to humans (in particular key management schemes) but also the performance impact of security protocols must be understood. In this context, we have been working on the following topics:  
 Design of a session resumption mechanism for SSH 
  Extensions of the SNMP architecture to leverage secure transports 
  Performance analysis of SNMP over SSH/TLS/DTLS 
  Prefix- and lexicographic-order-preserving IP address anonymization

   Underwater Networks (2009-2011)  
 Underwater networking technologies are recently getting more research attention since the exploration and monitoring of the oceans has become increasingly important. In the aquatic environment, acoustic communication is frequently used to cover longer distances since higher frequencies are easily absorbed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the acoustic channel change significantly depending on the depth, salinity, or temperature of the water, and there are often strong fluctuations of the channel characteristics. We have been working on the following topics:  
 Channel, propagation and ambient noise models 
  NS-2 based underwater networking simulation 
  USARSim based underwater robotics communication simulation 
  Environmentally adaptive networking (routing, modulation)

   Disruption Tolerant Networks (2008-2011)  
 Disruption tolerant networks are designed to provide communication in unstable and stressed environments, where the network is subject to frequent and long lasting disruptions. In this context, we have looked at techniques that can save energy and at the same time offer a high probability to enable communication.

   Distributed Case-based Reasoning (2007-2011)  
 The resolution of faults in communication networks and distributed systems is to a large extend a human driven process. The fault resolution process is usually assisted by trouble ticket systems to organize the work-flows. Today, the Internet contains a large amount of information that can be used to find similar cases in order to resolve a fault. However, general purpose search engines do not work too well. Our contribution is the design of a distributed case-based reasoning system to assist operators in resolving faults:  
 Peer-to-peer architecture using feedback search 
  Semi-structured multi-vector data representation method 
  Crawlers for extracting data from bug tracking systems 
  Probabilisitic and collaborative reasoning engines

 Title:  Formal Specification of Autonomy Features with ARE and KnowLang  
 Abstract:   
 Autonomous systems, such as autonomous vehicles, extend upstream the regular software-intensive systems with special autonomy features. The identification of such features is not necessarily an easy task. Sometimes, those can be explicitly stated by stakeholders or in preliminary material available to requirements engineers. Often though, they are implicit, so a process of formal specification intended to capture the autonomy features has to be undertaken. This paper elaborates on a methodology for capturing and specification of autonomy features where autonomy requirements are captured with ARE (Autonomy Requirements Engineering) and then are specified with KnowLang. a framework for knowledge representation and reasoning. In this approach, autonomy features are detected as special self-* objectives backed up by different capabilities and quality characteristics. The self-* objectives provide the system’s ability to autonomously discover, diagnose, and cope with various problems. The captured autonomy requirements are formally specified with the KnowLang notation and then compiled to a knowledge base that is to be used by the KnowLang Reasoner.

 Title:  Synthesizing (Differential) Invariants by Reduction Non-Convex Programming to SDP  
 Abstract:   
 Invariant Generation plays a central role in the verification of programs and hybrid systems. As the constraint solving techniques advance rapidly in recent years, particularly optimization-based constraint solving, optimization based invariant generation becomes more and more promising and has been successfully applied to verification of programs and hybrid systems. However, how to deal with non-convex programming derived from invariant generation is still challenging. In this talk, I report our recent work on efficient invariant generation by reduction non-convex programming to SDP.

Throughout his career he has work with industry on the practical application of formal methods and model based software engineering to safety critical real-time software. After working with industry partners in the nuclear and medical domains earlier in his career, over the past decade he has increasingly focused on working with OEMs on assurance of automotive systems.  
 Title:  Challenges and Opportunities in Assurance of Software Defined Vehicle  
 Abstract:   
 Automotive innovation is increasingly software driven. As a result of the competitive environment requiring a yearly release of new automotive models featuring the latest driver assistance features and innovation in electrification, safety critical software is being developed at an unprecedented scale on extremely tight deadlines. To be competitive automotive manufacturers and parts suppliers need to change how they develop and assure software intensive systems. This presents a tremendous opportunity for researchers in the application of formal methods and model based software engineering to have a significant impact on industry practice. In this talk we highlight our recent work on model based software engineering, incremental assurance and the potential for applications of formal methods to help the automotive industry make the transition to the Software Defined vehicle.

 Submission Link   

 Doctoral Symposium Paper Submission  
 The ICFEM Doctoral Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to formal methods for software, hardware and system development. This forum is an excellent opportunity bringing together PhD students and well-known established researchers from the formal methods community. It will also provide PhD students with fruitful feedback and advice on their research approach and enable them to interact with other PhD students in order to stimulate the exchange of ideas and the sharing of experiences among participants. In summary, the PhD forum will provide PhD students with an ideal opportunity to present, share and discuss their research in a constructive and critical scientific atmosphere.  
 We seek submissions from PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already published), but who still have substantial work to complete; or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations. It is not required to have a paper accepted at the main conference in order to participate in the ICFEM Doctoral Symposium.  
 Submissions to the Doctoral Symposium should include: Title of the research, the author name (single name) and affiliation; Context and motivation; Problem statement and related work; Proposed solutions and current research efforts, their significance, methodology, results and analysis, and future work. The paper should be prepared using the LNCS format  and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair.  
 The submission should not exceed 6-pages in LNCS format and accepted submissions will be included in the ICFEM 2024 proceedings.  
 Authors with accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Symposium in person to present their work. A discounted registration fee for Doctoral Symposium participants will be announced later.  

 Industrial Applications  
 Submissions to the Industrial Applications track should clearly describe how the relevant formal methods are applied to the development or maintenance of specific software or hardware systems in an engineering manner and should not exceed 6-pages in the LNCS format  . Accepted submissions will be included in the proceedings of ICFEM 2024.

 Welcome to MEMOCODE'24  
 MEMOCODE'24 is a part of ESWEEK 2024  , which will take place in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.  
 Over the last decade, the boundaries between computer system components, such as hardware, software, firmware, middleware, and applications, have blurred. This evolution in system design and development practices led in 2014 to a change in the title and scope of the MEMOCODE conference from its original focus on hardware/software co-design to its new focus on formal methods and models for developing computer systems and their components. MEMOCODE's objective is to emphasize the importance of models and methodologies in correct system design and development, and to bring together researchers and industry practitioners interested in all aspects of computer system development, to exchange ideas, research results and lessons learned.  
  
 The Organizing Committee of MEMOCODE'24 is composed of  
 General Co-Chairs: | Stephen A. Edwards, Columbia University, USA; | Claire Pagetti, ONERA, France 
  Qi Zhu, Northwestern University, USA; | Srinivas Pinisetty, IIT Bhubaneswar, India

  Conference: Oct 3-4, 2024 
   MEMOCODE'24 is a part of ESWEEK 2024  , which will take place in Raleigh, USA. Registered attendees can attend sessions in any of the online events, including the conferences (CASES, CODES+ISSS, EMSOFT), symposia, tutorials, workshops, and education classes. Submissions  
 MEMOCODE'24 calls for three kinds of submissions: regular papers, work-in-progress papers, and tool presentations. All papers must be written in English and formatted according to the IEEE Computer Society guidelines  . A double-blind review process  will be enforced. Authors must not reveal their identity directly or indirectly. Submission of papers is handled via HotCRP  .  
 Regular papers | are no longer than 10 pages, excluding bibliography and appendices. They should describe original work that does not overlap with another publication or a submission under review or accepted for publication by any other conference or journal. Reviewers will check regular papers for the soundness and novelty of the proposed solutions. 
  Tool papers | are no longer than 8 pages, excluding bibliography and appendices. They should describe an existing and publicly available tool that implements relevant methods. The methods might have been published before, but the tool should not have been described in a tool paper previously. In addition to reviewing the paper, reviewers will assess the tool itself using inputs and a user's manual provided by the authors on the tool's web page. 
  Work-in-progress (WIP) papers | are no longer than 4 pages, excluding bibliography and appendices. They should describe ongoing work. Reviewers will judge the novelty of the idea, but do not yet expect proofs for the envisioned results. 
  For questions regarding technical submissions, feel free to contact one of the program committee co-chairs. All accepted papers (regular papers, WIP papers, and tool papers) will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements. Publication in the proceedings is contingent on one author registering for and presenting the paper at the conference. We will also plan for a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems for which selected papers will be invited for publication. The Program Committee will also select 1-2 papers for the Best Paper Award.

 Welcome to the   
  Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics  
  website   
 The Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS) conference series focuses on the semantics of high-level programming languages and its logical and mathematical foundations. The MFPS series attracts logicians, mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists who meet to exchange ideas and discuss problems of mutual interest.  
   
  MFPS meetings typically feature several plenary talks by leading researchers, as well as special sessions. Each special session focuses on a particular topic, with a plenary lecture, followed by several shorter talks by other experts in the area. The overall goal is to enhance interactions with neighboring areas, by inviting colleagues from those areas to present talks about their research and how it interacts with the traditional focus areas of MFPS. The remainder of the program is devoted to contributed talks selected by the Program Committee from submissions received in response to the Call for Papers.  
   
  The 2025 meeting will take place Glasgow, Scotland in June. More details – including the Call for Papers – can be found here  .

 In recent years, the distinction between computer system components such as hardware, software, firmware, middleware, and applications has become less clear. As a result, the MEMOCODE conference underwent a change in 2014, shifting its focus from hardware/software co-design to formal methods and models for computer system development. The aim of MEMOCODE is to highlight the significance of models and methodologies in accurate system design and development, and to create a platform for researchers and industry professionals to share ideas, research findings, and experiences in all areas of computer system development.

 Scope  
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Bloomington, Indiana (US, 2023), Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK, 2019), Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005). The 11th edition will be held in Glasgow, UK, co-located with MFPS XLI. It is planned as a physical, in-person event.  
 Submission Categories  
 CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of submissions.  
 Regular papers that report  
 results on theoretical foundations, 
  novel methods and techniques for software development, 
  experiences with technology transfer to industry. 
  (Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that  
 present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way. 
  Early ideas abstracts that lead to  
 presentations of work in progress, 
  proposals for original venues of research. 
  Tool presentation papers that  
 report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.

  Submission Guidelines  
 All submissions will be handled via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25   
 The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the latest version of the style: http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/   
 It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics series.  
 A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer Science  , containing extended versions of selected papers, is planned.  
 Regular papers  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (Co)algebraic pearls  
 This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should not be longer than regular papers in the format specified by LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference.  
 Early ideas abstracts  
 Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.  
 Tool papers  
 Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the time of submission for download and evaluation.  
 Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards  
 This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants.

 7th International Conference on Applied Category Theory   
  40th Conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics   
  ACT & MFPS • Oxford • June 2024    

 ACT: Applied Category Theory  
 Call for papers  
 The Seventh International Conference on Applied Category Theory will take place at the University of Oxford from 17 - 21 June 2024, preceded by the Adjoint School 2024 from 10-14 July. This year, the ACT Conference will be co-located with the 40th Conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS). This conference follows previous events at University of Maryland College Park (MD), Strathclyde (UK), Cambridge (UK), Cambridge (MA), Oxford (UK) and Leiden (NL).  
 Applied category theory is important to a growing community of researchers who study computer science, logic, engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, social science, systems, linguistics and other subjects using category-theoretic tools. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category Theory conference series is to bring researchers together, strengthen the applied category theory community, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.  
 SUBMISSION  
 Important dates:  
 March 26: title and brief abstract submission 
  March 29: paper submission 
  May 3: notification of authors 
  June 17–21: conference 
  Submissions  
 The submission URL is: https://openreview.net/group?id=AppliedCategoryTheory.org/ACT/2024/Conference  . Please allow time to create an OpenReview account.  
 We accept submissions in English of original research papers, talks about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, and demonstrations of relevant software. Accepted original research papers will be published in a proceedings volume. The conference will include an industry showcase event and community meeting. We particularly encourage people from underrepresented groups to submit their work and the organizers are committed to non-discrimination, equity, and inclusion.  
 Conference Papers should present original, high-quality work in the style of a computer science conference paper (up to 12 pages, not counting the bibliography; more detailed parts of proofs may be included in an appendix for the convenience of the reviewers). Such submissions should not be an abridged version of an existing journal article although pre-submission arXiv preprints are permitted. These submissions will be adjudicated for both a talk and publication in the conference proceedings. 
  Talk proposals not to be published in the proceedings, e.g. about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, should be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages long. Authors are encouraged to include links to any full versions of their papers, preprints or manuscripts. The purpose of the abstract is to provide a basis for determining the topics and quality of the anticipated presentation. 
  Software demonstration proposals should also be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages. The purpose of the abstract is to provide the program committee with enough information to assess the content of the demonstration. 
  The selected conference papers are expected to be published with EPTCS, and authors are advised to use the style files available at style.eptcs.org  .  
 Reviewing will be single-blind, and we are not making public the reviews, reviewer names, the discussions nor the list of under-review submissions. This is the same as previous instances of ACT.  
 In order to give our reviewers enough time to bid on submissions, we ask for a title and brief abstract of your submission by March 26. For all planned submissions, please do provide a title and short text abstract by March 26. The full two-page pdf extended abstract submissions and up to 14 page proceedings submissions are both due by the submissions deadline of March 29 11:59pm aoe.  
 Please contact the Programme Committee Chairs for more information: David Jaz Myers (Abu Dhabi) and Michael Johnson (Sydney).

 Scope  
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Bloomington, Indiana (US, 2023), Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK, 2019), Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005). The 11th edition will be held in Glasgow, UK, co-located with MFPS XLI. It is planned as a physical, in-person event.  
 Submission Categories  
 CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of submissions.  
 Regular papers that report  
 results on theoretical foundations, 
  novel methods and techniques for software development, 
  experiences with technology transfer to industry. 
  (Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that  
 present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way. 
  Early ideas abstracts that lead to  
 presentations of work in progress, 
  proposals for original venues of research. 
  Tool presentation papers that  
 report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.

  Submission Guidelines  
 All submissions will be handled via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25   
 The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the latest version of the style: http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/   
 It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics series.  
 A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer Science  , containing extended versions of selected papers, is planned.  
 Regular papers  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (Co)algebraic pearls  
 This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should not be longer than regular papers in the format specified by LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference.  
 Early ideas abstracts  
 Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.  
 Tool papers  
 Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the time of submission for download and evaluation.  
 Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards  
 This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants.

  Hosting Middleware 

 Welcome to the website of the MIDDLEWARE series of conferences!  
 The Middleware conference is a forum for the discussion of important innovations and recent advances in the design, construction and uses of middleware. Middleware is a distributed-system software that resides between applications and underlying platforms (operating systems; databases; hardware), and/or ties together distributed applications, databases or devices. Its primary role is to coordinate and enable communication between different layers or components while isolating much of the complexity of distribution into a single, well tested and well understood system abstraction.  
 The scope of the conference is the design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of distributed system platforms and architectures for future computing and communication environments.  
 MIDDLEWARE 2024  will be held in Hong Kong, China.  
 MIDDLEWARE 2025  will be held in Nashville, TN, USA

  Announcements  
 MICRO is Almost at Capacity!  
 October 24, 2024   
   
 This year we have the fortune of benefiting from a great deal of enthusiasm for the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture conference in Austin, Nov 2nd through 6th. As a result we are looking at a record breaking number of registrants this year. Unfortunately, the downside is that we are likely to exceed the venue capacity for the main conference before the conference's opening date. We expect to reach this limit within the next week and once this happens we will close any new registrations. If you are interested in attending please register ASAP to ensure you are able to attend. It is unlikely that we will have any on-site registration. We are looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible in two weeks!

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  WSESE 2025 ( series  ) /  2nd International Workshop on Methodological Issues with Empirical Studies in Software Engineering WSESE 2025   
   
 About 
  Call for Papers 
  Theme & Goals   
 With the steep increase in empirical studies and the advent of secondary studies that aggregate their results, a main concern is their quality. Although researchers have raised concerns about various quality issues for many years, many of these issues persist, partially due to the complexity of empirical studies in our field—whether human subjects are involved or not. Problems related to appropriate design and the correct usage of statistical methods are crucial for the reliability of the results. Consequently, as a community, we need to better understand these issues and how to mitigate, if not eliminate, them. The workshop’s aim is to increase awareness of the importance of quality and appropriateness in the methods applied during the different stages of software engineering empirical studies to yield reliable results and to disseminate this knowledge to the broader SE community.  
 This year, we are placing a special emphasis on Machine Learning (ML). We encourage submissions that explore the integration and application of ML techniques throughout the empirical process. Contributions that address methodological challenges in conducting empirical studies with ML techniques are highly welcomed.

 Call for Papers  
  
 This year, we are placing a special emphasis on Machine Learning (ML). We encourage submissions that explore the integration and application of ML techniques throughout the empirical process. Contributions that address methodological challenges in conducting empirical studies with ML techniques are highly welcomed.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:    
 Issues with the motivation and definition of appropriate research questions. 
  Issues with the operationalization, e.g., missing standard metrics. 
  Issues with the systematic identification of threats to validity and how to address them 
  Issues selecting an appropriate study design and the consequences of that selection, 
  Issues with drawing appropriate conclusions from the findings and generalizing them 
  Issues with aggregating results from individual studies 
  Issues with reproduction, replication, or families of studies 
  Issues with quantitative, qualitative approaches and combined approaches 
  Issues with understanding failures and successes: lessons learned 
  Paper categories    
 Technical papers | ( | 6-8 pages including references | ): formally describe studies, explain how they were designed and executed to overcome challenges, highlight concrete results, and describe any advances to the state-of-the-art. 
  Experience reports / Work in progress | ( | 4-6 pages including references | ) describe the experience in conducting studies and lessons learned that address methodological issues. 
  Vision / Position papers | ( | 2-4 pages including references | ) describe new directions in conducting empirical studies including convincing arguments supported by clear rationale. 
  Panel proposals | ( | 1-2 pages including references | ) discuss hot topics about conducting empirical studies. 
  Papers must describe original work that has not been submitted to or presented at other forums (although the studies described may have been). Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE workshop proceedings.  
 Submission information    
 Submissions will be made via hotcrp. Papers must be formatted according to ICSE 2025 guidelines  . Please, note that WSESE does not follow double-anonymous review process.   
 The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by IEEE. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

 June 26, 2024  MIS4TEL Conference  
 By Creativity Matters  in conference     
    
 In June 2024 Fuad Budagov attended Salamanca Tech Summit to present his latest article titled “A Systematic Literature Review on the Applicability of Robot Assistants in Higher Education” that he co-authored with Janika Leoste, Mohammad Tariq Meeran, and Tarmo Robal on a Conference on Methodologies and Intelligent Systems for Technology Enhanced Learning (MIS4TEL)  
 This summit took place at the Palacio de Congresos de Salamanca in June 26-28 and transformed Salamanca into a hub of technological innovation, featuring experts from top companies. As Fuad put it later on, “it was inspiring to be among leading minds discussing the latest advancements in educational technology, artificial intelligence, and more. The discussions and feedback we received were invaluable, providing new insights and perspectives on our research. Additionally, networking with peers and industry leaders has opened up potential collaborations for future projects. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that highlighted the important role of technology in enhancing education”.

 The 16th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference  will be held from March 31st to April 3rd, 2025 in Stellenbosch, South Africa  

 ACM MMSys 2025  
 The 16th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference and associated workshops (i.e. MMVE & NOSSDAV) will be held from March 31st  to April 3rd, 2025  in Stellenbosch, South Africa  . MMsys 2025 brings together experts from academia and industry to share their latest research findings in the field of multimedia systems.  
  
  While other venues focus on specific aspects related to multimedia systems, MMSys serves as an inclusive and interdisciplinary forum spanning a broad range of topics related to multimedia systems such as networking, operating systems, real-time systems, databases, mobile computing, distributed systems, computer vision, and middleware communities. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the intersections and the interplay of the various approaches and solutions developed across these domains.  
  
  MMSys 2025 and co-located workshop will be a fully in-person event. We expect at least one author of accepted papers from all the tracks to attend the conference and present their papers physically. The conference will be a great opportunity to meet and interact with prominent researchers from around the world. Social events will make MMSys 2025 a memorable event letting attendees enjoy the beauties of Stellenbosch.  
   
  We look forward to seeing you in Stellenbosch!

 ACM Policy on Authorship and Generative AI Tools  
 We follow the ACM Policy on Authorship (approved by the ACM Publications Board on April 20, 2023) which state the following:  
   
  Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.. If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.  
   
  Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work. As the line between Generative AI tools and basic word processing systems like MS-Word or Grammarly becomes blurred, this Policy will be updated.  
   
  For further details and additional policies, please check the ACM website  and the related Frequently Asked Questions here  .   
 Revise and Resubmit Policy  
 Authors of papers submitted in the first round that have received a Revise and Resubmit recommendation are invited to submit a revision of their submission and a response to reviewers by the second submission deadline (November 22nd 2024). Note that author lists are not allowed to be changed after the review period has started. No new authors may be added during the revise and resubmit period, or for the camera-ready version due to potential conflicts of interest  (see ACM policy here  ).

 The International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward.

 Scope  
 Current society heavily relies on software and software systems. Due to its increasing complexity, the design and operation of software systems are becoming challenging. In the last decades, a great deal of effort has been put into addressing software systems design, development, and maintenance challenges. Empirical evidence shows that one of the most critical success factors when developing software systems is their Software Architecture (SA). A SA describes software systems in terms of software components, their interactions, and critical quality attributes. Among other benefits, SAs improve the overall communication among different stakeholders, are the carriers of significant design decisions, promote the use of different abstraction levels, and allow for the early assessment of the software under development.  
 Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a paradigm that refers to the systematic use of models as first-class entities throughout the software engineering life cycle. MDE shifts the focus of software development from third-generation programming languages to models. Within MDE, models are manipulated automatically using software programs, also known as model transformations.  
 In recent years, several studies have been discussing the interplay of SA and MDE, focusing on the benefits of combining these two disciplines. For instance, several works have been proposing the use of metamodels and modeling languages and the formal representation of software (reference) architectures. Other works have focused on using models and metamodels to represent the different structures and quality views. Additional research has been investigating the use of model transformations as automation to enable early analysis and simulation of SAs. Eventually, the interplay between SA and MDE could be beneficial from a tooling perspective, as it would enable the re-use of techniques and technologies used for manipulating (meta)models in the context of SAs.  
 Despite the advancements, several open challenges still compel the effective interplay between SA and MDE.  
 MDE4SA 2025 aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners where novel and innovative solutions to current and future challenges on the interplay between SAs and MDE can be presented and discussed  
 Topics of interest  
 The workshop is a forum where researcher and practitioners can share current problems and innovative solutions including, but not limited to:  
  - Model-driven techniques and methodologies for designing SA  
  - Architectural description of SA design, considering logical and physical aspects through MDE  
  - Model-driven approaches for defining and measuring Quality-of-Service (QoS) in SAs  
  - Analysis of architectural designs and architectural patterns  
  - Approaches for migrating legacy architecture towards microservice architectures, serverless by means of MDE techniques  
  - Industrial practices and tools supporting the adoption of MDE into SA  
  - Methodologies adopted in industrial contexts  
  - Model repositories for SA  
  - Code generation from SA models and transformation approaches  
  - Change Propagation in SA views and consistency management  
  - Evolution of SA through modeling  
  - Empirical studies on SA and MDE areas

 About MMAR  
  
 MMAR 2025  
 The International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics is an annual conference that has been held since 1994. The next 29th one will take place in Międzyzdroje, Poland, between Tuesday, 26th August and Friday, 29th August 2025.  
 The Conference will be a good opportunity for highlighting the new results and directions of automatic control theory, technology and applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
  – Identification, modelling and simulation,  
  – Signal processing,  
  – Control and systems theory,  
  – Robotics,  
  – Intelligent systems and methods,  
  – Control systems.  
 The participants of the 29th International MMAR Conference will have the opportunity to take part in the wide spectrum of categories for technical presentations, including plenary lectures, regular papers of both lecture and poster session types. We look forward to seeing our old and new friends in Poland. You are kindly invited to participate in the 29th International MMAR Conference in Miedzyzdroje, Poland.  
 We’re aware some of the authors may have objections against travelling and attending the event on-site. For those, we make it possible to participate in the conference online – presenting their papers and taking part in all sessions by means of video conference. Please choose your preferred way of participation in the registration form.  
 We still hope most of you will decide to arrive and enjoy the conference on-site.  
 See you in Międzyzdroje,
