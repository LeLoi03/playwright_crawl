 Description   
 Save the Date!  MODSIM World 2025 will bring together Modeling & Simulation (M&S) leaders dedicated to forging the future by bridging gaps in technology, innovation, and collaboration. This dynamic, multi-disciplinary, and international conference will feature three core presentation tracks: Industry, Defense, and Training & Education. Each track will spotlight cutting-edge advancements and approaches in areas such as Engineering, Medical Simulation, Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Extended Reality, Gamification, and Visualizations.  
 In a rapidly evolving world, our military, first responders, government agencies, and global leaders must be ready to adapt to new challenges, seize opportunities, and navigate complex geopolitical landscapes. This requires foresight, innovation, and the ability to bridge the gaps that stand between today's capabilities and tomorrow's needs. MODSIM World 2025, with its theme “Forging the Future: Bridging the Gaps through Modeling and Simulation,” emphasizes the crucial role that the M&S community plays in creating the future. Together, we can bridge the gaps, harness the power of technology, and shape a future that thrives in complex environments and under any circumstances. Join us to connect face-to-face with global innovators and experts across paper presentations, panels, exhibits, and networking events to discover more about forging the future of M&S.  
 MODSIM World features a robust agenda of papers and panels, industry workshops, and competition events, as well as an exhibit floor featuring a variety of companies and organizations showcasing new advances in M&S.  
 Be sure to watch this event webpage and MODSIMWorld.org   for continued updates on the agenda and planning.

 First Call for Papers, 14th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction  
 Deadline:  4/17/2022  
 ====================================================================== *** CALL FOR PAPERS -- MPC 2022 *** 14th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction 26th-28th of September 2022, Tbilisi, Georgia Co-located with the Computational Logic Autumn Summit (CLAS'22) ====================================================================== TIMELINE: Abstract submission 10th April 2022 Paper submission 17th April 2022 Author notification 27th May 2022 Camera ready copy 24th June 2022 Conference 26th-28th September 2022 BACKGROUND: The International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC) aims to promote the development of mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in the process of constructing computer programs. MPC 2022 will be held in Tbilisi, Georgia, on the 26th-28th September 2022, and is co-located with the Computational Logic Autumn Summit (CLAS'22). Previous conferences were held in Porto, Portugal (2019); Königswinter, Germany (2015); Madrid, Spain (2012); Québec City, Canada (2010); Marseille, France (2008); Kuressaare, Estonia (2006); Stirling, UK (2004); Dagstuhl, Germany (2002); Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000); Marstrand, Sweden (1998); Kloster Irsee Germany (1995); Oxford, UK (1992); Twente, The Netherlands (1989). SCOPE: MPC seeks original papers on mathematical methods and tools put to use in program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to support for program construction in programming languages and systems. Typical areas include type systems, program analysis and transformation programming language semantics, security, and program logics. The notion of a 'program' is interpreted broadly, ranging from algorithms to hardware. Theoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance to program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome provided that their mathematical basis is evident. We also encourage the submission of 'programming pearls' that present elegant and instructive examples of the mathematics of program construction. SUBMISSION: Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, maximum 250 words) must be submitted by 10th April 2022. Full papers (pdf, formatted using the llncs.sty style file for LaTex) must be submitted by 17th April 2022. There is no prescribed page limit, but authors should strive for brevity. Both abstracts and papers will be submitted using EasyChair. Papers must present previously unpublished work, and not be submitted concurrently to any other publication venue. Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee according to their relevance correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Accepted papers must be presented in person at the conference by one of the authors. The proceedings of MPC 2022 will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, as with all previous instances of the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to transfer copyright to Springer for this purpose. After the conference, authors of the best papers from MPC 2022 will be invited to submit revised versions to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP). For any queries about submission please contact the program chair Ekaterina Komendantskaya or publicity chair Matthew Daggitt KEYNOTE SPEAKERS: TBA PROGRAMME COMMITTEE: Georg Struth University of Sheffield, UK Ana Sokolova University of Salzburg, Austria Annabelle McIver Macquerie University, Australia Jacques Carette McMaster University, Canada Shin-Cheng Mu Academia Sinica, Taiwan Jose Oliveira University of Minho, Portugal Johan Jeuring Utrecht University, Netherlands Ambrus Kaposi Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary Henning Basold Leiden University, Netherlands Peter Hoefner Australian National University, Australia Grant Passmore Imandra, USA Kathrin Stark Princeton University, USA Philip Saville University of Oxford, UK William Byrd University of Arizona, USA Andrea Costea National University of Singapopre, Singapore Radu Mardare University of Strathclyde, UK Patricia Johann Appalachian State University, USA Aurore Alcolei University of Bologna, Italy Others TBA CONFERENCE VENUE: The conference will be held at the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University (TSU), which is the oldest and largest educational and research institution not only in Georgia, but also in the South Caucasus. The venue is located in the city center, with many hotels, pubs restaurants, parks, other attractions (zoo, theaters, cinemas, opera etc.) within walking distance. Tbilisi International Airport is 15 km away from the city and offers direct connections to more than 30 destinations in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. From the airport, the city can be reached by bus or taxi. Another option is to fly to Kutaisi in the west of Georgia, where low budget air companies (such as WizzAir) are operating. A shuttle bus from the Kutaisi airport to Tbilisi takes about 3 hours. Georgia allows visa-free entry for nearly 100 countries around the world. Further details may be found at LOCAL ORGANISERS: Besik Dundua International Black Sea University For any queries about local issues please contact the local organiser Besik Dundua .

 Modeling and Optimization: Theory and Applications (MOPTA)   aims at bringing together a diverse group of people from both discrete and continuous optimization, working on both theoretical and applied aspects. There will be a small number of invited talks from distinguished speakers and contributed talks, spread over three days. Our target is to present a diverse set of exciting new developments from different optimization areas while at the same time providing a setting which will allow increased interaction among the participants. We aim to bring together researchers from both the theoretical and applied communities who do not usually have the chance to interact in the framework of a medium-scale event.

 Background The International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC) aims to promote the development of mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in the process of constructing computer programs. MPC 2022 is going to be held as part of the Computational Logic Autumn Summit of 2022 ( CLAS 2022). Previous conferences were held in: – Porto, Portugal (2019); – Königswinter, Germany (2015); – Madrid, Spain (2012); – Québec City, Canada (2010); – Marseille, France (2008); – Kuressaare, Estonia (2006); – Stirling, UK (2004); – Dagstuhl, Germany (2002); – Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000); – Marstrand, Sweden (1998); – Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995); – Oxford, UK (1992); – Twente, The Netherlands (1989). Scope MPC seeks original papers on mathematical methods and tools put to use in program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to support for program construction in programming languages and systems. Typical areas include type systems, program analysis and transformation, programming language semantics, security, and program logics. The notion of a ‘program’ is interpreted broadly, ranging from algorithms to hardware. Theoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance to program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome, provided that their mathematical basis is evident. We also encourage the submission of ‘programming pearls’ that present elegant and instructive examples of the mathematics of program construction.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2022-04-17

 Modeling and Optimization: Theory and Applications (MOPTA)  aims at bringing together a diverse group of people from both discrete and continuous optimization, working on both theoretical and applied aspects. There will be a small number of invited talks from distinguished speakers and contributed talks, spread over three days. Our target is to present a diverse set of exciting new developments from different optimization areas while at the same time providing a setting which will allow increased interaction among the participants. We aim to bring together researchers from both the theoretical and applied communities who do not usually have the chance to interact in the framework of a medium-scale event.

 Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR)  
  MPLR is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems around, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 MPLR Steering Committee   
 The current MPLR steering committee is:  
 Stefan Marr | , Chair 
  Tony Hosking 
  Christos Kotselidis 
  Herbert Kuchen 
  Jeremy Singer 
  Elisa Gonzalez Boix 
  Tobias Wrigstad 
  MPLR History   
 MPLR commenced in 2002 as a Java-focused conference (Principles and Practice of Programming in Java, PPPJ). In 2017, the scope was broadened and the event was renamed to ManLang (Managed Languages and Runtimes). In 2019 it was again renamed to MPLR (Managed Programming Languages and Runtimes).

  The 21st International Conference on Managed Programming Languages and Runtimes (MPLR 2024, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems around, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Papers accepted by MPLR 2024 describe original research results and have not been published anywhere else. Each submitted paper has received a minimum of three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers have been selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the MPLR 2024 symposium and present the paper.  
 We are thrilled to announce our distinguished keynote speaker  for MPLR 2024:  
 Dr. Ben Titzer  from Carnegie Mellon University will be talking about:  
 Can WebAssembly Be Software’s Final Substrate?  
 Since the dawn of computing, many formats for executable programs have come and gone. The design of an executable format encounters design choices and tradeoffs such as expressiveness, ease of parsing/decoding/execution, the level of abstraction, and performance. With the advent of WebAssembly, a portable low-level compilation target for many languages, an intriguing question arises: can we finally standardize a universal binary format and software virtual machine? After many years, I believe that we finally can. Unlike language-specific bytecode formats whose abstraction level serves only one language family well, or machine-code formats that serve specific ISAs and operating systems well, WebAssembly sits between these levels of abstraction. In this talk I will share my vision for a future where all software sits on a standardized, well-specified, formally-verified substrate that allows innovation above and below, and unlocks high performance and portability for all programming languages.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The 21st International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Topics   
 The areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Languages and Compilers | Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …) 
  Domain-specific languages 
  Language design 
  Compilers and interpreters 
  Type systems and program logics 
  Language interoperability 
  Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency 
  Virtual Machines | Portable intermediate representations (e.g., JVM, WebAssembly, RPython, …) 
  Managed runtime systems (e.g., GraalVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, JavaScriptCore, .NET, …) 
  VM design and optimization 
  VMs for mobile and embedded devices 
  VMs for real-time applications 
  Memory management and garbage collection 
  Hardware/software co-design 
  Persistence 
  Techniques, Tools, and Applications | Static and dynamic program analysis 
  Testing and debugging 
  Refactoring 
  Program understanding 
  Program synthesis 
  Security and privacy 
  Performance analysis and monitoring 
  Compiler and program verification and model checking 
  If you are unsure whether a particular topic falls within the scope of MPLR’24 or if you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Program Chair Christoph Kirsch at ck@cs.uni-salzburg.at   
 Submission Categories   
 MPLR accepts four types of submissions:  
 Regular research papers | , describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Work-in-progress research papers | , describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Industry and tool papers | , presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content); 
  Posters and demonstrations | , which will be evaluated similarly to work-in-progress papers. (Format: poster pdf and 1-page abstract). 
  Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.  
 MPLR 2024 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication   
 Author Instructions   
 Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan  style.  
 If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the acmart  document class with the sigplan  option ( not  the sigconf  option). In the acmart-primary.zip  file that downloads from the LaTeX (Version 1.90) link on the https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  page, look for samples/sample-sigplan.tex  as a guide. If you use Overleaf, be sure to change the documentclass  option manuscript  to sigplan  . For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX command \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  . Please use the standard setting, e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format uses two columns for the test.  
 All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing  . Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person.  We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Submission Site: https://mplr24.hotcrp.com   
 Important Dates   
 Paper Submission Deadline: May 25, 2024 
  Paper Author Notification: June 24, 2024 
  Camera Ready for Papers: July 31, 2024 
  Posters and Demos Submission Deadline: August 5, 2024 
  Posters and Demos Notification: August 12, 2024 
  Conference Date: September 19, 2024 
  All deadlines are 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h).  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  

 Call for Posters and Demos  
  
 Posters  are an excellent opportunity for researchers to submit novel ideas with preliminary results within the topics of the conference. Posters can also accompany a paper submission as a way to provide additional demonstration and discussion opportunities. They will be evaluated similarly to work-in-progress papers. The text should contain sufficient technical details of the work such that the committee can assess its relevance.  
 Submission format  : one-page poster draft accompanied by an abstract of maximum two pages (excluding references).  
 Demonstrations  allow authors to showcase their work in an interactive way. Demo submissions may include (but are not limited to) demonstrations of research prototypes, tool tutorials, live coding sessions, and demonstrations of (industrial or academic) applications. Authors of demos should submit a one-page abstract describing the tool/technology they have created and why it is relevant for the conference. In an additional page, the authors should indicated the intended duration of the demo and describe what participants of the demonstration will be able to see or do with the prototype. During the demonstration authors are expected to discuss scientific and technical aspects of the prototype and should not push any commercial agenda.  
 Submission format  : abstract and additional information of maximum one page each (excluding references). Optionally, a link to a video/media file can be submitted to support the submission.  
 The abstracts will not appear as part of the conference proceedings (because the camera-ready deadline is too early for that), but if at submission time you mark whether you would like to have the abstract appear online, we will put it online. You may want to use the ACM SIGPLAN format like the regular submissions.

  The 21st International Conference on Managed Programming Languages and Runtimes (MPLR 2024, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems around, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Papers accepted by MPLR 2024 describe original research results and have not been published anywhere else. Each submitted paper has received a minimum of three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers have been selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the MPLR 2024 symposium and present the paper.  
 We are thrilled to announce our distinguished keynote speaker  for MPLR 2024:  
 Dr. Ben Titzer  from Carnegie Mellon University will be talking about:  
 Can WebAssembly Be Software’s Final Substrate?  
 Since the dawn of computing, many formats for executable programs have come and gone. The design of an executable format encounters design choices and tradeoffs such as expressiveness, ease of parsing/decoding/execution, the level of abstraction, and performance. With the advent of WebAssembly, a portable low-level compilation target for many languages, an intriguing question arises: can we finally standardize a universal binary format and software virtual machine? After many years, I believe that we finally can. Unlike language-specific bytecode formats whose abstraction level serves only one language family well, or machine-code formats that serve specific ISAs and operating systems well, WebAssembly sits between these levels of abstraction. In this talk I will share my vision for a future where all software sits on a standardized, well-specified, formally-verified substrate that allows innovation above and below, and unlocks high performance and portability for all programming languages.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The 21st International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Topics   
 The areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Languages and Compilers | Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …) 
  Domain-specific languages 
  Language design 
  Compilers and interpreters 
  Type systems and program logics 
  Language interoperability 
  Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency 
  Virtual Machines | Portable intermediate representations (e.g., JVM, WebAssembly, RPython, …) 
  Managed runtime systems (e.g., GraalVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, JavaScriptCore, .NET, …) 
  VM design and optimization 
  VMs for mobile and embedded devices 
  VMs for real-time applications 
  Memory management and garbage collection 
  Hardware/software co-design 
  Persistence 
  Techniques, Tools, and Applications | Static and dynamic program analysis 
  Testing and debugging 
  Refactoring 
  Program understanding 
  Program synthesis 
  Security and privacy 
  Performance analysis and monitoring 
  Compiler and program verification and model checking 
  If you are unsure whether a particular topic falls within the scope of MPLR’24 or if you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Program Chair Christoph Kirsch at ck@cs.uni-salzburg.at   
 Submission Categories   
 MPLR accepts four types of submissions:  
 Regular research papers | , describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Work-in-progress research papers | , describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Industry and tool papers | , presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content); 
  Posters and demonstrations | , which will be evaluated similarly to work-in-progress papers. (Format: poster pdf and 1-page abstract). 
  Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.  
 MPLR 2024 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication   
 Author Instructions   
 Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan  style.  
 If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the acmart  document class with the sigplan  option ( not  the sigconf  option). In the acmart-primary.zip  file that downloads from the LaTeX (Version 1.90) link on the https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  page, look for samples/sample-sigplan.tex  as a guide. If you use Overleaf, be sure to change the documentclass  option manuscript  to sigplan  . For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX command \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  . Please use the standard setting, e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format uses two columns for the test.  
 All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing  . Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person.  We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Submission Site: https://mplr24.hotcrp.com   
 Important Dates   
 Paper Submission Deadline: May 25, 2024 
  Paper Author Notification: June 24, 2024 
  Camera Ready for Papers: July 31, 2024 
  Posters and Demos Submission Deadline: August 5, 2024 
  Posters and Demos Notification: August 12, 2024 
  Conference Date: September 19, 2024 
  All deadlines are 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h).  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  

 Call for Posters and Demos  
  
 Posters  are an excellent opportunity for researchers to submit novel ideas with preliminary results within the topics of the conference. Posters can also accompany a paper submission as a way to provide additional demonstration and discussion opportunities. They will be evaluated similarly to work-in-progress papers. The text should contain sufficient technical details of the work such that the committee can assess its relevance.  
 Submission format  : one-page poster draft accompanied by an abstract of maximum two pages (excluding references).  
 Demonstrations  allow authors to showcase their work in an interactive way. Demo submissions may include (but are not limited to) demonstrations of research prototypes, tool tutorials, live coding sessions, and demonstrations of (industrial or academic) applications. Authors of demos should submit a one-page abstract describing the tool/technology they have created and why it is relevant for the conference. In an additional page, the authors should indicated the intended duration of the demo and describe what participants of the demonstration will be able to see or do with the prototype. During the demonstration authors are expected to discuss scientific and technical aspects of the prototype and should not push any commercial agenda.  
 Submission format  : abstract and additional information of maximum one page each (excluding references). Optionally, a link to a video/media file can be submitted to support the submission.  
 The abstracts will not appear as part of the conference proceedings (because the camera-ready deadline is too early for that), but if at submission time you mark whether you would like to have the abstract appear online, we will put it online. You may want to use the ACM SIGPLAN format like the regular submissions.

 The purpose of the International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development is to provide a platform for researchers, engineers, academics as well as industrial professionals from all over the world to present their research results and development activities in using models and model driven engineering techniques for Software Development. Model-Driven Development (MDD) is an approach to the development of IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for analysis of these systems but also for their construction. MDD has emerged from modelling initiatives, most prominently the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) fostered by the Object Management Group (OMG). In the scope of MDA, a couple of technologies have been developed that became the cornerstones of MDD, like metamodelling and model transformations. MDD relies on languages for defining metamodels, like the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and Ecore (developed in the scope of the Eclipse Modelling Framework), and transformation specification languages like QVT and ATL.

 Mining Software Repositories 2025  
   
 Welcome to the website of the Mining Software Repositories 2025 conference!  
 The Mining Software Repositories  (MSR) conference is the premier venue for software analytics research, according to which software engineering data is analyzed using a mixture of data science, machine learning/artificial intelligence and qualitative methodologies. The goal of the conference is to improve software engineering practices by uncovering interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects using the vast amounts of software data such as source control systems, defect tracking systems, code review repositories, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, and run-time telemetry. Mining this information can help to understand software development and evolution, software users, and runtime behavior; support the maintenance of software systems; improve software design/reuse; empirically validate novel ideas and techniques; support predictions about software development; and exploit this knowledge in planning future development.  
 Six years after the successful Montreal edition, Canada is delighted to host the conference again, this time in its capital, Ottawa (Ontario). MSR 2025 continues the tradition of bringing together leading researchers and practitioners of the field, together with students and other participants eager to learn the latest and greatest MSR developments, in order to discuss the latest advancements, innovations, and insights in mining software repositories. With the abundant data available in modern software development, the conference will serve as an essential platform for the exchange of knowledge and the fostering of collaborations aimed at leveraging data science to address pressing challenges in software engineering.  
 We welcome you to Ottawa (Ontario, Canada) on the 28th and 29th of April, 2025  , and are looking forward to discuss the next advances in the field of mining software repositories!

 The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is the premier conference for data science (DS), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering. There are vast amounts of data available in software-related repositories, such as source control systems, defect trackers, code review repositories, app stores, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, package registries, and run-time telemetry. The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including: studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior; empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems; and cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.  
 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 We invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 Soundness | : This aspect pertains to how well the paper’s contributions — whether they involve new methodologies, applications of existing techniques to unfamiliar problems, empirical studies, or other research methods — address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures. For short papers, the expectation is for more limited evaluations given their narrower scope. 
  Relevance | : The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering. 
  Novelty | : How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies. 
  Presentation | : How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided. 
  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .

 Call for Papers 
  Call for Papers  
  
 The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is the premier conference for data science (DS), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering. There are vast amounts of data available in software-related repositories, such as source control systems, defect trackers, code review repositories, app stores, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, package registries, and run-time telemetry. The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including: studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior; empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems; and cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.  
 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 We invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 Soundness | : This aspect pertains to how well the paper’s contributions — whether they involve new methodologies, applications of existing techniques to unfamiliar problems, empirical studies, or other research methods — address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures. For short papers, the expectation is for more limited evaluations given their narrower scope. 
  Relevance | : The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering. 
  Novelty | : How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies. 
  Presentation | : How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided. 
  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .

  Call for Papers 
  The 20th International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR’23, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems around, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Papers accepted by MPLR’23 describe original research results and have not been published anywhere else. Each submitted paper has received a minimum of three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers have been selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the MPLR’23 symposium and present the paper.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 Call for Papers  
  
 The 20th International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Topics   
 The areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Languages and Compilers | Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …) 
  Portable intermediate representations such as WebAssembly 
  Domain-specific languages 
  Language design 
  Compilers and interpreters 
  Type systems and program logics 
  Language interoperability 
  Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency 
  Virtual Machines | Managed runtime systems (e.g., JVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, JavaScriptCore, LLVM, .NET CLR, RPython, GraalVM, …) 
  VM design and optimization 
  VMs for mobile and embedded devices 
  VMs for real-time applications 
  Memory management and garbage collection 
  Hardware/software co-design 
  Persistence 
  Techniques, Tools, and Applications | Static and dynamic program analysis 
  Testing and debugging 
  Refactoring 
  Program understanding 
  Program synthesis 
  Security and privacy 
  Performance analysis and monitoring 
  Compiler and program verification and model checking 
  If you are unsure whether a particular topic falls within the scope of MPLR’22 or if you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Program Chair (moss at cs dot umass dot edu).  
 Submission Categories   
 MPLR accepts four types of submissions:  
 Regular research papers | , describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Work-in-progress research papers | , describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Industry and tool papers | , presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content); 
  Posters and demonstrations | , which will be evaluated similarly to work-in-progress papers. (Format: poster pdf and 1-page abstract). 
  Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.  
 MPLR 2023 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/   
 Author Instructions   
 Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan  style.  
 If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the acmart  document class with the sigplan  option ( not  the sigconf  option). In the acmart-primary.zip  file that downloads from the LaTeX (Version 1.90) link on the https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  page, look for samples/sample-sigplan.tex  as a guide. If you use Overleaf, be sure to change the documentclass  option manuscript  to sigplan  . For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX command \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  . Please use the standard setting, e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format uses two columns for the test.  
 All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing  . Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person.  We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Submission Site: https://mplr23.hotcrp.com/

  Call for Papers 
  Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward!   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2023papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is the premier conference for data science (DS), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering. There are vast amounts of data available in software-related repositories, such as source control systems, defect trackers, code review repositories, app stores, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, package registries, and run-time telemetry. The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including: studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior; empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems; and cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.  
 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 We invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 Soundness | : This aspect pertains to how well the paper’s contributions — whether they involve new methodologies, applications of existing techniques to unfamiliar problems, empirical studies, or other research methods — address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures. For short papers, the expectation is for more limited evaluations given their narrower scope. 
  Relevance | : The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering. 
  Novelty | : How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies. 
  Presentation | : How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided. 
  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .

There are vast amounts of data available in software-related repositories, such as source control systems, defect trackers, code review repositories, app stores, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, package registries, and run-time telemetry. The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including: studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior; empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems; and cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.  
 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 We invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 Soundness | : This aspect pertains to how well the paper’s contributions — whether they involve new methodologies, applications of existing techniques to unfamiliar problems, empirical studies, or other research methods — address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures. For short papers, the expectation is for more limited evaluations given their narrower scope. 
  Relevance | : The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering. 
  Novelty | : How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies. 
  Presentation | : How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided. 
  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .

 The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is the premier conference for data science (DS), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering. There are vast amounts of data available in software-related repositories, such as source control systems, defect trackers, code review repositories, app stores, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, package registries, and run-time telemetry. The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including: studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior; empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems; and cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.  
 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.

  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .

  How are ratings calculated?   To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzes reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 NEW: Challenge preprint available here    
 Using package managers is a simple and common method for reusing code through project dependencies. However, these direct dependencies can themselves rely on additional packages, resulting in indirect dependencies. It may then become complex to get a grasp of the whole set of dependencies of a project. Beyond individual projects, a deep understanding of how software ecosystems work and evolve is also a critical prerequisite for achieving sustained success in software development.  
 This year’s mining challenge focuses on dependencies and dependency ecosystem analysis using the Goblin framework that has been presented at the previous edition of the MSR conference. Goblin is composed of a Neo4J Maven Central dependency graph  and a tool called Weaver  for on-demand metric weaving into dependency graphs. As a whole, Goblin is a customizable framework for ecosystem and dependency analysis.  
 Challenge   
 The analysis of a software ecosystem graph presents numerous research opportunities, allowing for the investigation of various questions in areas such as structural analysis, community detection, dependency optimization, and risk assessment within the Maven Central ecosystem.  
 The following suggested questions outline potential research inquiries: Questions in groups 1 to 5 can be addressed with the dependency graph database alone  , questions in group 6 require the additional use of the Weaver  , and questions in group 7 illustrate examples of inquiries that would require an extension of the Weaver  .  
 Ecosystem evolution | i. What are the patterns in the growth of the Maven Central graph across different time periods? | ii. Do libraries tend to use more dependencies than in the past? | iii. Is the rhythm of library releases higher than in the past, and how has this rhythm evolved over time? | iv. Does the emergence of project management methods (e.g., agile methods) have any impact on the release rhythm of libraries? | v. To what extent does the ecosystem contain unmaintained libraries? | vi. How do projects with unmaintained dependencies cope with the challenges they face? 
  Clustering | i. Can we deduce different clusters from Maven Central’s comprehensive dependency graph? How do these clusters interact with one another? | ii. Can dependency-based clustering reveal domain-specific groupings, and how well do they align with known categorizations of projects? | iii. How can clustering be used to identify high-risk clusters in the Maven Central ecosystem? | iv. Which artifacts serve as the most crucial dependencies for the ecosystem (i.e., most depended upon)? | v. How do these central nodes affect the overall health and stability of the ecosystem? 
  Dependency update | i. How often do projects update their dependencies, and what factors influence this frequency (e.g., project size, popularity, type)? | ii. Whenever an artifact releases a new version, how do its dependents react? | iii. How does the removal or failure of certain projects affect the overall network (e.g., log4j Vulnerability)? | iv. How do major versus minor dependency updates differ in frequency and impact? | v. Do projects tend to avoid major updates due to the potential for breaking changes? 
  Trends | i. How has the adoption of new frameworks (e.g., Spring Boot, Microservices) changed the dependency structures in Maven Central? | ii. What impact do modern dependency management tools (e.g., Dependabot) have on the ecosystem? | iii. How does the adoption of newer Java versions influence dependency graphs? | iv. Does an artifact’s number of dependents correlate with other popularity metrics such as GitHub stars? 
  Graph theory | i. How do metrics such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and average path length characterize the dependency graph? | ii. Is the graph scale-free, small-world, or does it exhibit other known graph structures? | iii. Are certain types of projects more likely to be central (hubs) or peripheral (leaves) in the graph structure? | iv. Is the graph made up of connected components with no relationship between them? | v. How do shortest path lengths between projects vary, and what does this tell us about the overall connectivity of the ecosystem? 
  Vulnerability | i. How do vulnerabilities propagate through the dependency network, and which projects are most affected? | ii. What proportion of releases have vulnerabilities? What is the proportion of releases directly and transitively impacted? | iii. What is the average time taken to patch a vulnerability in a dependency? | iv. How do users of an artifact react to the discovery of a vulnerability in that artifact? 
  Licensing and Compliance | i. Are there dominant license types, and how do they influence the usage and distribution of projects? | ii. How does the choice of licenses affect the artifact graph structure? | iii. What percentage of projects have conflicting licenses within their dependency trees? 
  Description of the Challenge Dataset and Tooling   
 The Goblin framework (see figure below) is organized around a Neo4J database of the whole Maven Central dependency graph. This database can be created and updated incrementally using Goblin Miner. The database can be queried directly using Cypher (the Neo4j query language) or through the Goblin Weaver tool. More generally, Goblin Weaver comes with an API for the on-demand weaving of user-programmed metrics of interest (added values) into the dependency graph. Several such metrics are already available: CVEs, popularity, freshness and release rhythm. As a whole, Goblin aims to be a customizable framework for working on software dependencies at the ecosystem level.  
   
 The dependency graph database  is composed of two node types (for libraries and for their releases) and two edge types (from releases to their dependencies and from libraries to their releases). The nodes for libraries (type Artifact) contain the Maven id (g.a) information. The nodes for releases (type Release) contain the Maven id (g.a.v), the release timestamp, and the version information. The edges for dependencies (type dependency) are from Release nodes to Artifact nodes and contain target version (which can be a range) and scope (compile, test, etc). The edges for versioning (type relationship_AR) edges are from Artifact nodes to Release nodes.  
 The latest version of our dataset, dated August 30th, 2024, contains 15,117,217 nodes (658,078 libraries and 14,459,139 releases) and 134,119,545 edges (119,660,406 dependencies and 14,459,139 versioning edges).  
 We also provide a second version of this dataset enriched with the Weaver metrics, which has the effect of creating new “AddedValue” nodes in the database containing the metrics (CVE (dated September 4, 2024), freshness, popularity and speed).  
 The Goblin Miner  allows you to update the dependency graph database or recreate it from scratch. The Miner Java source code is available.  
 The Goblin Weaver REST API  is available as an alternative for direct access to the database using the Cypher language and for on-demand enrichment of the dependency graph with new information. A memoization principle is available to avoid re-computing enrichments, as soon as the base graph is not re-computed or incremented. For this, new kinds of nodes (type AddedValue) and edges (type addedValues from an Artifact or Release node to an AddedValue node) are used in the graph database. One should be careful, as the graph is large, calculating metrics (especially aggregate ones) for the whole graph can be time-consuming. The Weaver Java source code is available.  
 A tutorial is available online on this GitHub repository  . The issue tracking system will also enable one to ask questions on the datasets and tooling.   
 How to Participate in the Challenge   
 First, familiarize yourself with the Goblin framework:  
 The Maven Central Neo4j dataset is available on this | Zenodo archive | . 
  To import this dump into Neo4J, please use a dbs version 4.x. 
  The Weaver project is available in our | GitHub repository | . 
  This paper | https://doi.org/10.1145/3643991.3644879 | gives a more in-depth presentation of how the Goblin framework works. 
  A project for simply setting up a Neo4j database and Weaver API using Docker is available here: | https://github.com/Goblin-Ecosystem/Neo4jWeaverDocker 
  Use the dataset to answer your research questions, and report your findings in a four-page challenge paper that you submit to our challenge. If your paper is accepted, present your results at MSR 2025 in Ottawa, Canada!  
 Submission   
 A challenge paper should describe the results of your work by providing an introduction to the problem you address and why it is worth studying, the version of the dataset you used, the approach and tools you used, your results and their implications, and conclusions. Make sure your report highlights the contributions and the importance of your work. See also our open science policy regarding the publication of software and additional data you used for the challenge.  
 To ensure clarity and consistency in research submissions:  
 When detailing methodologies or presenting findings, authors should specify which snapshot/version of the Goblin dataset (and the Weaver version if used) was utilized. 
  Given the continuous updates to the dataset, authors are reminded to be precise in their dataset references. This will help maintain transparency and ensure consistent replication of results. 
  Submissions must conform to the IEEE formatting instructions IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc  or compsocconf  options).  
 Submissions to the Challenge Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. We encourage authors to upload their paper info early (the PDF can be submitted later) to properly enter conflicts for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 Submissions must not exceed the page limit ( | 4 pages | plus 1 additional page of references). The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  Submissions must not reveal the authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person. Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found in the | Q&A page from ICSE | . 
  Submissions should consider the | ethical implications | of the research conducted within a separate section before the conclusion. 
  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM or IEEE Digital Libraries. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
  Purchases of additional pages in the proceedings are not allowed. 
  Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review. In addition, by submitting to the MSR Challenge Track, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the following policies:  
 The | ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | and the | IEEE Plagiarism FAQ | . In particular, papers submitted to MSR 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases (including immediate rejection and reporting of the incident to ACM/IEEE). To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  The | authorship policy of the ACM | and the | authorship policy of the IEEE | . 
  Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.

  Open Science Policy   
 Openness in science is key to fostering progress via transparency, reproducibility and replicability. Our steering principle is that all research output should be accessible to the public and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles. To increase reproducibility and replicability, we encourage all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of the software they used to retrieve and analyze the data 
  the (anonymized and curated) empirical data they retrieved in addition to the Goblin Maven dataset 
  a document with instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results 
  Already upon submission, authors can privately share their anonymized data and software on archives such as Zenodo  or Figshare  (tutorial available here  ). Zenodo accepts up to 50GB per dataset (more upon request). There is no need to use Dropbox or Google Drive. After acceptance, data and software should be made public so that they receive a DOI and become citable. Zenodo and Figshare accounts can easily be linked with GitHub repositories to automatically archive software releases. In the unlikely case that authors need to upload terabytes of data, Archive.org  may be used.  
 We recognise that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-blind your repository.  
 We encourage authors to self-archive pre- and post prints of their papers in open, preserved repositories such as arXiv.org. This is legal and allowed by all major publishers including ACM and IEEE and it lets anybody in the world reach your paper. Note that you are usually not allowed to self-archive the PDF of the published article (that is, the publisher proof or the Digital Library version). Please note that the success of the open science initiative depends on the willingness (and possibilities) of authors to disclose their data and that all submissions will undergo the same review process independent of whether or not they disclose their analysis code or data. We encourage authors who cannot disclose industrial or otherwise non-public data, for instance due to non-disclosure agreements, to provide an explicit (short) statement in the paper.  
 Best Mining Challenge Paper Award   
 As mentioned above, all submissions will undergo the same review process independently of whether or not they disclose their analysis code or data. However, only accepted papers for which code and data are available on preserved archives, as described in the open science policy, will be considered by the program committee for the best mining challenge paper award.  
 Best Student Presentation Award   
 Like in the previous years, there will be a public voting during the conference to select the best mining challenge presentation. This award often goes to authors of compelling work who present an engaging story to the audience. Only students can compete for this award.  

 Call for Mining Challenge Proposals  
  
 The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR)  has hosted a mining challenge since 2006. With this challenge, we call upon everyone interested to apply their tools to a common dataset. The challenge is for researchers and practitioners to bravely use their mining tools and approaches on a dare.  
 One of the secret ingredients behind the success of the International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is its annual Mining Challenge, in which MSR participants can showcase their techniques, tools, and creativity on a common data set. In true MSR fashion, this data set is a real data set contributed by researchers in the community, solicited through an open call. There are many benefits of sharing a data set for the MSR Mining Challenge. The selected challenge proposal explaining the data set will appear in the MSR 2025 proceedings, and the challenge papers using the data set will be required to cite the challenge proposal or an existing paper of the researchers about the selected data set. Furthermore, the authors of the data set will join the MSR 2025 organizing committee as Mining Challenge (co-)chair(s), who will manage the reviewing process (e.g., recruiting a Challenge PC, managing submissions, and reviewing assignments). Finally, it is not uncommon for challenge data sets to feature in MSR and other publications well after the edition of the conference in which they appear!  
 If you would like to submit your data set for consideration for the 2025 MSR Mining Challenge, prepare a short proposal (1-2 pages plus appendices, if needed) containing the following information:  
 Title of data set. 
  High-level overview: | Short description, including what types of artifacts the data set contains. 
  Summary statistics (how many artifacts of different types). 
  Internal structure: | How are the data structured and organized? 
  (Link to) Schema, if applicable 
  How to access: | How can the data set be obtained? 
  What are recommended ways to access it? Include examples of specific tools, shell commands, etc, if applicable. 
  What skills, infrastructure, and/or credentials would challenge participants need to effectively work with the data set? 
  What kinds of research questions do you expect challenge participants could answer? 
  A link to a (sub)sample of the data for the organizing committee to pursue (e.g., via GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare). 
  Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). Submit your proposal here  .  
 The first task of the authors of the selected proposal will be to prepare the Call for Challenge Papers, which outlines the expected content and structure of submissions, as well as the technical details of how to access and analyze the data set. This call will be published on the MSR website on September 2nd. By making the challenge data set available by late summer, we hope that many students will be able to use the challenge data set for their graduate class projects in the Fall semester.

 The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is the premier conference for data science (DS), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering. There are vast amounts of data available in software-related repositories, such as source control systems, defect trackers, code review repositories, app stores, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, package registries, and run-time telemetry. The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including: studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior; empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems; and cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.  
 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 We invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 Soundness | : This aspect pertains to how well the paper’s contributions — whether they involve new methodologies, applications of existing techniques to unfamiliar problems, empirical studies, or other research methods — address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures. For short papers, the expectation is for more limited evaluations given their narrower scope. 
  Relevance | : The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering. 
  Novelty | : How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies. 
  Presentation | : How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided. 
  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .

 Call for Papers 
  Call for Papers  
  
 The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is the premier conference for data science (DS), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering. There are vast amounts of data available in software-related repositories, such as source control systems, defect trackers, code review repositories, app stores, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, package registries, and run-time telemetry. The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including: studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior; empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems; and cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.  
 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 We invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 Soundness | : This aspect pertains to how well the paper’s contributions — whether they involve new methodologies, applications of existing techniques to unfamiliar problems, empirical studies, or other research methods — address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures. For short papers, the expectation is for more limited evaluations given their narrower scope. 
  Relevance | : The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering. 
  Novelty | : How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies. 
  Presentation | : How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided. 
  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .

 Call for Nominations 
  Call for Nominations  
  
 The Mining Software Repositories community gives three awards: the MSR Distinguished Doctoral Research Award, the MSR Ric Holt Early Career Achievement Award, and the MSR Foundational Contribution Award.  
 MSR Distinguished Doctoral Research Award   
 This award recognizes outstanding doctoral research that has the potential to have a strong and long-lasting impact in the research area of mining software repositories.  
 This award recognizes the research work for a dissertation submitted as a requirement for a PhD degree. To be eligible, the degree had to have been granted within the two years preceding the nomination date. Therefore, for nominations for 2025, PhD degrees awarded from December 16, 2022 to December 15, 2024 are eligible. Preference will be given to nominees who have had at least one publication in any MSR track during their doctoral research.  
 A 4-page dissertation summary, authored by the award winner, will be published in the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes (SEN) and referenced from the MSR Award website.  
 In 2024, the MSR Doctoral Research Award went to Gunnar Kudrjavets  for their contribution to improving code review velocity by empirically challenging prominent beliefs, presenting solutions, and identifying gaps in developers’ and industry needs.  
 Nomination procedure   
 This award is based on nominations written in English (the dissertation itself need not be written in English). Self-nominations are possible for this award. Nominations must be submitted through the following form: https://forms.gle/sj2sjHPEag8huMsP8   
 The nomination form will ask for the following:  
 The nominator’s name, affiliation, and email 
  The nominee’s name, affiliation, and email 
  A proposed citation for the award (max 180 characters, approx. 25 words) 
  (upload) a PDF of the PhD dissertation 
  (upload) the nominee’s CV including the list of publications (each entry in the publication list must specify the role of the nominee using the relevant CRediT roles, see | https://credit.niso.org/ | , and mark how it is related to the dissertation produced as part of the doctoral research) 
  The name, affiliation, and email of up to three references who are available to write a support letter within 4 weeks upon request (letters will be sought if the nominee is short-listed for the award) 
  MSR Ric Holt Early Career Achievement Award   
 This award recognizes outstanding junior researchers who have provided outstanding contributions in the area of mining software repositories. The award recognizes a candidate’s research output produced during the early stages of their career. To be eligible, a candidate’s most recent computer-related educational degree (baccalaureate, master’s, or doctoral degree) must have been awarded on or after January 1, 2018. If the degree included a defense, the defense must have occurred on or after January 1, 2018. If the degree included a thesis but did not require a defense, then the final submission of the thesis must have occurred on or after January 1, 2018. The award is named after Dr. Ric Holt (1941 – 2019) who was a professor at the University of Waterloo and made foundational contributions to our field, including organizing the 1st International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories in 2004.  
 The eligibility period may be extended under the following scenarios:  
 Extended sickness leave or part-time employment as a result of ongoing childcare or other caregiving responsibilities. Applicants can, with the prior approval of the Award Chairs, have their eligibility extended on a calculated pro rata for the year count. 
  Eligibility may also be extended to take into account any career interruptions experienced due to being the primary caregiver for young children born since their PhD was awarded. If the applicant is the primary caregiver of a dependent child, the applicant is able to extend the period of eligibility by two years per child. The extension of two years per dependent child is inclusive of any periods of parental leave. There is no maximum identified. 
  For the MSR 2024 Early Career Achievement Award, the recipient was Patanamon (Pick) Thongtanunam  for her contributions to understanding and improving modern code review practices using mining software repositories techniques.  
 Nomination procedure   
 This award is based on nominations written in English and submitted through the following form (self-nominations are not possible for this award): https://forms.gle/QytzM9hxS5xBvd6q6   
 The nomination form will ask for the following:  
 The nominator’s name, affiliation, and email 
  The nominee’s name, affiliation, and email 
  A proposed citation for the award (max 180 characters, approx. 25 words) 
  A short nomination statement (max 2.000 characters, approx. 250 words) 
  (upload) detailed nomination (unlimited length) in PDF format 
  The name and email of up to three references who are available to write a support letter within 4 weeks upon request (letters will be sought if the nominee is short-listed for the award) 
  MSR Foundational Contribution Award   
 The MSR Foundational Contribution Award recognizes individuals, or groups of individuals, having produced fundamental contributions in the field of mining software repositories, which helped many others (not limited to the MSR community) to build on it to advance the state of the art. It could be a tool, a dataset, a repository, or a mixture of contributions opening new research areas. It is not a requirement that such a research contribution has been presented at the MSR conference at some point. Having received other recognitions for the same contribution does not preclude an individual from being nominated for the MSR Foundational Contribution Award.  
 In 2024, the MSR Foundational Contribution Award went to Margaret-Anne (Peggy) Storey  for their methodological contributions to the community for work that goes beyond statistical models of mined repository data and encourages others to better understand their findings through triangulation using multiple methodologies.  
 Nomination procedure   
 This award is based on nominations written in English and submitted through the following form (self-nominations are not possible for this award): https://forms.gle/Nfd12bpGi4XxULx87   
 The nomination form will ask for the following:  
 The nominator’s name, affiliation, and email 
  The nominee(s)’s name, affiliation, and email (the MSR Foundational Contribution Award can be assigned to a set of people who, e.g., worked together on a contribution) 
  A proposed citation for the award (max 180 characters, approx. 25 words) 
  A short nomination statement (max 2.000 characters, approx. 250 words) 
  (upload) detailed nomination (unlimited length) in PDF format 
  The name and email of up to three references who are available to write a support letter within 4 weeks upon request (letters will be sought if the nominee is short-listed for the award) 
  Further information concerning all the awards   
 Eligibility criteria   
 Award Committee Chairs, Award Committee Members, the current and the 1st past Steering Committee Chairs of MSR cannot nominate, cannot be nominated, and cannot endorse (write letters). Everyone else, including Steering Committee Members, can nominate, be nominated, and endorse (write letters).  
 Awards Criteria   
 Research contribution: For all awards, we will consider the extent to which the candidate’s work advances the existing knowledge, theories, or practices. We’ll look for research that introduces novel concepts, approaches, or solutions to existing problems. For the Foundational Contribution Award, it will be expected that the contributions enable others in the MSR community and beyond to advance the state of the art. 
  Impact: For all awards, we will consider the extent to which the contributions have impacted or have the potential to impact the field of mining software repositories. 
  Merit relative to opportunity: The overall quality and impact of contributions and achievements will be given more weight than the quantity or rate of particular achievements, recognizing that these factors may be affected by personal circumstances and working arrangements.

 The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is the premier conference for data science (DS), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering. There are vast amounts of data available in software-related repositories, such as source control systems, defect trackers, code review repositories, app stores, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, package registries, and run-time telemetry. The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including: studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior; empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems; and cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.  
 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 We invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 Soundness | : This aspect pertains to how well the paper’s contributions — whether they involve new methodologies, applications of existing techniques to unfamiliar problems, empirical studies, or other research methods — address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures. For short papers, the expectation is for more limited evaluations given their narrower scope. 
  Relevance | : The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering. 
  Novelty | : How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies. 
  Presentation | : How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided. 
  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .

 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 We invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 Soundness | : This aspect pertains to how well the paper’s contributions — whether they involve new methodologies, applications of existing techniques to unfamiliar problems, empirical studies, or other research methods — address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures. For short papers, the expectation is for more limited evaluations given their narrower scope. 
  Relevance | : The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering. 
  Novelty | : How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies. 
  Presentation | : How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided. 
  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .

 Synopsis    
 This volume contains the proceedings of MPC 2000, the ?fth international c- ference on Mathematics of Program Construction. This series of conferences aims to promote the development of mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably useful and usable in the process of constructing c- puter programs (whether implemented in hardware or software). The focus is on techniques that combine precision with concision, enabling programs to be constructed by formal calculation. Within this theme, the scope of the series is very diverse, including programming methodology, program speci?cation and transformation, programming paradigms, programming calculi, and progr- ming language semantics. The quality of the papers submitted to the conference was in general very high. However,the number of submissions has decreased compared to the pre- ous conferences in the series. Each paper was refereed by at least ?ve and often more committee members. In order to maintain the high standards of the c- ference the committee took a stringent view on quality; this has meant that, in some cases, a paper was rejected even though there was a basis for a good c- ference or journal paper but the submitted paper did not meet the committee’s required standards. In a few cases a good paper was rejected on the grounds that it did not ?t within the scope of the conference.

 Sustainability statement  
 For all tracks, we strongly encourage work complying with the “Green AI” principles (Schwartz et al. 2020) and focusing on reducing the environmental cost of MT model training and usage by, among others, improving training and inference efficiency. Furthermore, we strongly encourage authors who carry out computational experiments to report average runtime for each model/algorithm, estimate energy cost and to add a carbon impact statement  to their paper following the guidelines by Henderson et al. (2020).  
 Below is a list of tools that can be used to estimate carbon emissions of an experiment:

 MTNS  is a major symposium in the general area of mathematical systems theory, networks and control. The symposium is interdisciplinary and attracts mathematicians, engineers and researchers working in all aspects of systems theory and its applications. The symposium is held every two years. Mathematical methods which play a role in the areas mentioned above stem from a broad range of fields of pure and applied mathematics, including ordinary and partial differential equations, real and complex analysis, numerical analysis, probability theory and stochastic analysis, operator theory, linear and commutative algebra as well as algebraic and differential geometry. Application areas range from biology, communications and mathematical finance to problems in electrical, mechanical, aerospace and chemical engineering, and robotics. The associated International Workshop on Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA 2024)  takes place at the University of Kent, Canterbury UK, 12-16 August 2024.  
 MTNS is co-sponsored by IFAC

  Title:  Architectural Questions in Distributed Systems and Controls  
  Abstract:  In the design and control of large-scale distributed systems, architectural considerations are arguably some of the most important ones. These include local versus global feedback in multi-agent systems, sensor and actuator placement in distributed control of PDEs, how far should sensor information travel in distributed controller architectures, the structure and realizations of distributed controllers, and many other related issues. Many of these questions have significant implications for plant and system co-design, which are perhaps even more important than controller design itself. We survey some of these questions using specific case studies to point out the role of optimal and robust control in determining limits of performance, which in turn inform controller and system architecture motifs. The case studies will evoke more questions than answers, indicating the need for a more developed theory of systems and controls architecture.

  Speaker:  Dennice Gayme (Johns Hopkins University)  
  Title:  A network view of wind farm modeling and control  
  Abstract:  Wind farms comprise a network of dynamical systems coupled through interactions with the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The ABL dynamics govern the velocity field that enters the farm as well as the turbulent mixing that regenerates energy for extraction at downstream rows, thereby playing a fundamental role in wind farm power production. Understanding the dynamic interactions between turbines, wind farms, and the ABL is therefore critical for improving wind farm performance. This talk introduces a suite of models that leverage ABL information to provide improved models of both static and dynamic conditions in the wind farm. An example of such a dynamic model in a control setting provides a case study wherein turbines are viewed as actuators that adjust the flow field to collectively produce more efficient power tracking performance.

  Speaker:  Suvrit Sra (TU Munich & MIT)  
  Title:  AI and optimization through a geometric lens  
  Abstract:  Geometry arises in a myriad ways across the sciences, and quite naturally also within AI and optimization. In this talk I wish to share with you examples where geometry helps us understand problems in machine learning, optimization, and sampling. For instance, when sampling from densities supported on a manifold, understanding geometry and the impact of curvature are crucial; surprisingly, progress on geometric sampling theory helps us understand certain generalization properties of SGD for deep-learning! Another fascinating viewpoint afforded by geometry is in non-convex optimization: geometry can either help us make training algorithms more practical for deep learning, it can reveal tractability despite non-convexity (e.g., via geodesic convexity), or it can simply help us understand important ideas better (e.g., eigenvectors, LLM training and inference, etc.)  
  My hope is to offer the audience insights into geometric thinking, and to share with them some new tools that can help us make progress on modeling, algorithms, and applications. To make my discussion concrete, I will recall a few foundational results arising from our research, provide several examples, and note some open problems.

  Speaker:  Wendelin Werner (University of Cambridge)  
  Title:  About Probability in the Continuum  
  Abstract:  The usual way to think about randomness is to start from the discrete world, where one tosses a finite collection of random variables. When the randomness is in fact “spread” in a fairly natural way over space, then in some cases, rather complex and interesting random geometric physically relevant structures with some surprising features can emerge. The aim of this talk is to illustrate this using some specific examples that arose in recent works.  
 Bio:  Wendelin Werner is Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics and Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Cambridge.

  Speaker:  Daniel Alpay (Chapman University)  
  Title:  Infinite dimensional analysis, Hida white noise space and applications to linear systems with random coefficients  
   Abstract:  Infinite dimensional analysis is at the crossroad of the theory of positive definite kernels, stochastic processes, complex analysis, and topological vector spaces. It has numerous applications, with connections to second quantization, stochastic linear systems, models for stochastic processes and their derivatives. In the talk we will survey some of these connections, focusing on links with the theory of linear systems. A non-commutative version of the theory will also be presented.

  Speaker:  Ravi Banavar (IIT Bombay)  
  Title:  The Ubiquity and Applications of Lie Groups  
  Abstract:  The comfort zone of most engineers is the Euclidean space. Most applications of the past century have relied on tools from the repository of this space – transforms, projections, norms and inner products. However, the intrinsic nature of many problems in engineering is not in this setting. Therefore, solutions that have been proposed in an Euclidean setting are necessary “local” and hence termed “coordinate-dependant.” This weakness has beckoned new paradigms. Not stepping too far away from the comfort zone of Euclidean space, we encounter Lie Groups. The umbilical connection of a Lie group to a Lie algebra (a vector space) brings in familiarity in terms of many tools commonly employed in Euclidean space. In this talk I shall present preliminary machinery for Lie groups, and four domains of applications – multiagent control, consensus, optimal control and observer design.  
  Bio:  Ravi N. Banavar is currently an Institute Chair Professor in Systems and Control Engineering at IIT Bombay. He received his B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras (1986), his Masters (Mechanical, 1988) and Ph.D. (Aerospace, 1992) degrees from Clemson University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively. He had a brief teaching stint at UCLA during 1991–92, soon after which he joined the Systems and Control Engineering group at IIT Bombay in early 1993.

  Speaker:  Silvère Bonnabel (Mines-Paris Tech)  
  Title:  Enhancing Kalman Filtering with Backpropagation: Theory and Examples  
  Abstract:  The Kalman filter (KF) and its nonlinear extension (EKF) are a cornerstone in estimating the state of a dynamical system from noisy measurements, crucial for many real-world applications. However, the accuracy of those filters, whether used in a probabilistic setting or as observers, hinge on precise tuning of various parameters. The sensitivity equations, developed by Gupta and Mehra in 1974 for maximum likelihood parameter estimation, allow for computation of the effect of small variations in these parameters on the KF estimates and its internal variables. By leveraging the gradient backpropagation method, a key technique in neural networks, we introduce a much more numerically efficient method to analytically compute these derivatives for the KF and the EKF. Their applicability is also extended beyond traditional maximum likelihood estimation.  
  We illustrate the potential of these novel sensitivity equations through several applications: fault detection, where gradient-based insights detect structured spurious measurements; adaptive filtering, where an EKF combined with a shallow neural network, that dynamically adapts its noise parameters at all times, allows for localization of a car over hours using only inertial measurements; and active sensing, where gradients of the EKF’s covariance matrix with respect to the control inputs allow for computation of trajectories that optimize the information gathered by sensors, demonstrated with real experiments.

  Speaker:  Venkat Chandresakaran (Caltech)  
  Title:  Any-dimensional optimization  
  Abstract:  Optimization problems in many applications arise naturally as sequences indexed by dimension. In extremal combinatorics and information theory, sequences of problems are indexed by graph size or number of channel uses, and it is of interest to obtain bounds on the optimal values of all problems in a sequence or on the limiting value. In other domains such as inverse problems and combinatorial optimization, the objective is to design tractable relaxations that are compatible across dimension in various ways depending on the application.  
  We present a systematic treatment of sequences of convex programs by explicitly considering relations between problem instances of different dimensions. We show that such sequences are often described in a manner that makes their instantiation in every dimension obvious. Such ‘free’ descriptions arise from a recently identified phenomenon in algebraic topology called representation stability.  
  Our framework yields two types of consequences. First, we show that certain sequences of invariant convex programs that are commonly seen in applications can be solved using a number of operations that is independent of dimension. Second, we present new approaches to design convex relaxations from data – in our setting, input-output training data are provided for problem instances of low dimension and we derive a sequence of convex relaxations that can be employed for problems in any dimension, including those not in the training set.  
  Bio:  Venkat Chandrasekaran is on the faculty at Caltech, where he is Tomiyasu Professor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences and of Electrical Engineering.

  Speaker:  Jie Chen (City University of Hong Kong)  
  Title:  When is a Time-Delay System Stable and Stabilizable? A Third-Eye View  
  Abstract:  Time delays are a prevailing scene in natural and engineered systems. While a recurring subject in classical studies, modern interconnected networks are especially prone and indeed, are vulnerable to long and variable delays; systems and networks in this category are many, ranging from communication networks, sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, to biological systems. A time-delay system may or may not be stable for different lengths of delay, and further, may or may not be stabilized under a conventional feedback mechanism. When will then a delay system be stable or unstable, and for what values of delay? When can an unstable delay system be stabilized? What range of delay can a feedback system tolerate to maintain stability? Fundamental questions of this kind have long eluded engineers and mathematicians alike, yet ceaselessly invite new thoughts and solutions. In this talk I shall present a nontraditional perspective on the stability and stabilization of time-delay systems, wherein we attempt to develop tools and techniques that answer to the questions alluded to above, seeking to provide exact and efficient computational solutions to stability and stabilization problems of time-delay systems. We develop in full an operator-theoretic approach that departs from both the classical algebraic and the omnipresent LMI solution approaches, notable for both its conceptual appeal and its computational efficiency. Preceding this development we shall also develop the necessary mathematical foundation centered at operator perturbation series, which characterize the analytical and asymptotic properties of eigenvalues of matrix-valued functions or operators. Extensions to contemporary topics such as networked control and multi-agent systems may also be addressed.

  Abstract:  Diffusion processes refer to a class of stochastic processes driven by Brownian motion. They have been widely used in various applications, ranging from engineering to science to finance. In this talk, I will discuss my experiences with diffusion and how this powerful tool has shaped my research programs. I will go over several research projects in the area of control, inference, and machine learning, where we have extensively utilized tools from diffusion processes. In particular, I will present our research on three topics: i) covariance control in which we aim to regulate the uncertainties of a dynamic system; ii) diffusion models for generative modeling in machine learning; iii) and Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling for general inference tasks.

  Speaker:  Jean-Charles Delvenne (UCLouvain)  
  Title:  Nanoscale control theory  
  Abstract:  Modelling and design of interconnected nanoscale systems, such as electronic circuits or biochemical networks, call for a rewriting of the rulebook of control theory. In order to agree with fundamental laws of nature, such as microscopic reversibility and ubiquitous thermal noise, one must merge dissipative systems theory on the one hand, with stochastic thermodynamics on the other hand.  
  An overarching theme is the trade-off between dissipation and various objective functions such as precision or speed. We introduce and illustrate those trade-offs on a range of systems, from molecular motors to ultra-low-power electronic memories.  
  Bio:  Jean-Charles Delvenne received the M. Eng. degree (2002) and a Ph.D. (2005) in Applied Mathematics from Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.

  Speaker:  Giulia Giordano (University of Trento)  
  Title:  Robustness and resilience of dynamical networks in nature  
  Abstract:  Biological, ecological and epidemiological systems can be seen as dynamical networks, namely dynamical systems that are naturally endowed with an underlying network structure, because they are composed of several subsystems that interact according to an interconnection topology. Despite their large scale and complexity, natural systems are often able to preserve fundamental properties and qualitative behaviours even in the presence of huge perturbations and uncertainties, both intrinsic and extrinsic. We look for the source of the extraordinary robustness that often characterises systems in nature, by identifying properties and emerging behaviours that exclusively depend on the system structure (the graph topology along with qualitative information), regardless of parameter values. We focus on the parameter-free assessment of important properties, such as the stability of equilibria and the sign of steady-state input-output influences, thus allowing structural model falsification and structural comparison of alternative mechanisms proposed to explain the same phenomenon. Finally, we discuss the limitations of structural methodologies, which may be overcome by integrating and complementing them with probabilistic approaches, and we propose definitions of resilience that complement the notion of robustness and can be effectively applied to biological models.

  Speaker:  Birgit Jacob (University of Wuppertal)  
  Title:  Port-Hamiltonian Systems: Modelling and Analysis  
  Abstract:  The port-Hamiltonian system formulation combines several traditions from mechanics, system modelling and control. One of these is port-based modelling, in which complex systems can be represented by the interconnection of simpler blocks. By using energy as a common language for the connection, this approach enables the modelling of systems belonging to different physical domains (mechanical, electrical, thermal, …). In particular, we model interacting particle systems as port-Hamiltonian systems and investigate analytical properties of a class of port-Hamiltonian systems on a one-dimensional spatial domain.  
  Bio:  Birgit Jacob received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from the University of Dortmund, Germany, in 1992 and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Bremen, Germany, in 1995.

  Speaker:  Timothy O’Leary (University of Cambridge)  
  Title:  Closed loop neurophysiology  
  Abstract:  The nervous system is the epitome of a dynamic network, operating in tight feedback with the environment. Due to the closed loop relationship between neural activity and behaviour, it is difficult to establish whether a signal in the brain drives a behavioural outcome or merely reports it, and it is even harder to manipulate brain activity in a systematic way. As a result, much of what we know about nervous system function is correlative, and most of the technology we have for manipulating the brain works despite its dynamics rather than in tandem with them.  
  In this talk I will highlight two aspects of our recent attempts to study nervous systems in closed loop with data driven models. First, I will describe brain-machine interfaces (BMI) we developed to understand how abstract representations of the environment are used by rodents to navigate virtual environments. I will show how the neural code can be surprisingly simple in some brain areas, enabling robust decoding with no learning required by the animal. I will also show how adaptive properties in other neural circuits can make them extremely sensitive to coupling via brain-machine interfaces, to the extent that the code itself may reconfigure completely during BMI use. In the second part of the talk, I will describe our efforts to use tools from system identification to constrict data-driven predictive models of neural activity. We focus on the dynamics of small central pattern generating circuits that control movement. The internal dynamics of these circuits is extremely rich, and this presents an obstacle to building predictive, data driven models with “the right level” of detail. I will describe work we are doing to build such models and ultimately use them to control the activity of living neural circuits in real time.  
  Bio:  Timothy O’Leary’s research interests lie at the intersection between physiology, neural computation and feedback control. Originally trained as a pure mathematician, he dropped out of a PhD in hyperbolic geometry to retrain as an experimental physiologist. After obtaining his doctorate from the University of Edinburgh in 2009, he pursued a mixture of theoretical and experimental research on homeostasis, neural circuit dynamics and neuromodulation. From 2012-2016 he worked with Prof Eve Marder in Brandeis University, USA, where he developed theory that reconciles nervous system variability with reliable function. For this work he was awarded the Gruber International Prize in 2014. In 2016 he embarked on mission to try to bring together control engineers and neuroscientists, forming an ERC-funded research group in the University of Cambridge. In 2017 he became a HFSP Young Investigator, leading an international collaboration between his group and experimentalists in the Weizmann Institute of Science and Harvard Medical School to attempt to understand how navigational information is represented in the brain. This has led to recent insights in how memories can be formed and maintained in the absence of stable synaptic connections, how neural circuit size influences learning performance, and how neural signals can be decoded to control movement in real time. He was elected a FENS-Kavli Fellow in 2021 and serves as a reviewing editor for The Journal of Neuroscience.  
  
  Speaker:  Amirhossein Taghvaei (University of Washington)  
  Title:  Towards data-driven nonlinear filtering algorithms  
  Abstract:  In this talk, I present a new variational formulation of the Bayes’ law, that will be used for construction of a new family of nonlinear filtering algorithms. The variational formulation is based on the optimal-transportation (OT) theory, and aims at approximating the Brenier Optimal transport map from the prior to the posterior distribution, as a solution to a stochastic optimization problem. Unlike sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle filters, the OT formulation does not require the analytical form of the likelihood. Moreover, it allows us to harness the approximation power of neural networks to model complex and multi-modal distributions and employ stochastic optimization algorithms to enhance scalability. I present error analysis and numerical results that illustrate the performance of the algorithm in comparison with the SIR particle filters, and present an extension of the algorithm that is model-free and only requires recorded data from the state and observation processes.  
  Bio:  Amirhossein Taghaei is an Assistant Professor in the William E. Boeing Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at University of Washington Seattle. Prior to that, he was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California Irvine in Prof. Tryphon Georgiou’s research lab.

His current research involves nonlinear filtering, computational optimal transport, and stochastic thermodynamics.  
  
  Speaker:  Melanie Zeilinger (ETH Zürich)  
  Title:  Optimization-based Control under Uncertainty: Guarantees, Performance & Computation  
  Abstract:  Increasing requirements on modern complex control systems amplify the challenging tradeoff between performance gains and safety concerns. Optimization-based control has a long history of providing rigorous control-theoretic guarantees, particularly for ensuring the satisfaction of critical safety constraints. Its popularity has recently surged due to its potential as a flexible framework for safe learning-based control. While a variety of methods are available to address model uncertainty, the context of learning and complex systems has emphasized the need for improved uncertainty handling to reduce conservativeness while maintaining strong controller guarantees.  
  The talk will begin with a holistic discussion of uncertainties arising in an optimization-based controller, ranging from model to numerical uncertainty. I will then discuss both the improved treatment of model uncertainty and concepts to reduce uncertainty through learning and data-driven techniques. The results will be accompanied by efficient computational methods, which are critical to enabling these advancements in practice.  
  Bio:  Melanie Zeilinger is an Associate Professor at the Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering at ETH Zurich, where she is leading the Intelligent Control Systems.

 *** APOLOGIES FOR CROSS-POSTINGS ***  
 20TH MACHINE TRANSLATION SUMMIT (GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, 23-24 JUNE 2025)  
 FIRST CALL FOR WORKSHOPS & TUTORIALS  
 *** Important dates ***  
 - Submission deadline: 25 November 2024  
  - Notification of acceptance: 13 December 2024  
  - Workshop date: 23 or 24 June 2025  
 *** Submission information ***  
 The European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT) invites proposals for tutorials & workshops to be held in conjunction with the MT Summit 2025 conference, taking place in Geneva, Switzerland. Workshops and tutorials will take place before the main conference, on 23 and 24 June 2025.  
 We seek proposals in all areas of machine translation, LLMs applied to translation, computer-assisted translation technologies, spoken language translation and related topics.  
 Please visit our official website for more information: https://mtsummit2025.unige.ch/   
 ***Call for Workshop Proposals***  
  Workshops will be held on June 23-24, 2025. We invite proposals for half-day or full-day workshops (up to 8 hours, including breaks). Workshops should provide an opportunity for MT-related communities to advance the state of thinking or practice in their area of interest.  
 MT Summit workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT­related communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state of thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or endeavour.  
 Workshops may be scheduled as half-day or full-day events (up to 8 hours, including coffee and lunch breaks). Proponents need to explicitly state the duration of the workshop.  
 ***Call for Tutorial Proposals***  
 The aim of a tutorial is primarily to help the audience to develop understanding of specific technical, applied, and business matters related to research, development, and use of MT and translation technology.  
 Presentations of specific technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations.  
 We recommend that the tutorial covers work by the presenters as well as by other researchers. The submission should explain that this breadth is ensured. Tutorials should not be “self-invited talks”.  
 Tutorials are generally scheduled as half-day events (up to 3.5 hours, including coffee break).

 List of Topics  
  ------------------  
  Just as coding assistants have dramatically increased productivity for coding tasks over the last two years, researchers in the NLP community have begun to explore methods and opportunities ahead for creating scientific assistants that can help with the process of scientific discovery and increase the pace at which novel discoveries are made. Over the last year, language models have been used to create problem-general scientific discovery assistants that are not restricted to narrow problem domains or formulations. Such applications hold opportunities for assisting researchers in broad domains, or scientific reasoning more generally. Beyond assisting, a growing body of work has begun to focus on the prospect of creating largely autonomous scientific discovery agents that can make novel discoveries with minimal human intervention.  
 These recent developments highlight the possibility of rapidly accelerating the pace of scientific discovery in the near term. Given the influx of researchers into this expanding field, this workshop proposes to serve as a vehicle for bringing together a diverse set of perspectives from this quickly expanding subfield, helping to disseminate the latest results, standardize evaluation, foster collaboration between groups, and allow discussing aspirational goals for 2025 and beyond. As such, the workshop welcomes and covers a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to):  
 ***Literature-based Discovery:*** This topic focuses on using existing scientific articles to facilitate novel discoveries, by finding “undiscovered public knowledge’’, conditioning novel studies based on existing work, or easing the search and reading process. Systems that read the literature at scale may ultimately help us come up with research ideas that are more novel, broader in scope, and operationalized in more useful experiments.  
 ***Agent-centered Approaches:*** Agent models are being used to form end-to-end scientific discovery pipelines, with separate agents taking on different roles, such as hypothesis generation, execution, and reviewing experiments.  
 ***Automated Experiment Execution:*** Agents that can automatically execute experiments require a large number of pragmatic skills that emerging benchmarks are beginning to evaluate, including downloading data, writing code, and interfacing with apps.  
 ***Automated Replication:*** Science is generally suffering a “reproducibility crisis”, and NLP is not immune to this, with (for example) 59% of reproducibility attempts finding worse performance than papers originally reported. Automated reproducibility attempts to read original papers, Github repositories, and instructions, to replicate experiments fully automatically.  
 ***Data-driven Discovery:*** Reading existing papers and combining or re-analyzing existing datasets frequently allows for novel data-driven discoveries without having to collect new data empirically, and may yield inexpensive novel discoveries.  
 ***Discovery in Virtual Environments:*** Virtual environments, including text-based simulations, allow training and evaluating agents at aspects of the scientific discovery process in simulated proxy tasks without running physical experiments, which are costly and time consuming.  
 ***Discovery with Humans in the Loop:*** How can we make the textual knowledge from literature best engage with humans in the discovery process, through various interfaces, processes, and surfaces?  
 ***Assistants for Scientific Writing:*** Language models can be used as assistants in the scientific dissemination process, either as planners for writing text such as academic articles, or blog posts intended for public consumption.  
 Submission Guidelines  
  --------------------------------  
  We welcome three types of papers: archival workshop papers, non-archival papers, and non-archival cross-submissions. Only regular archival workshop papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the OpenReview website set up for this workshop ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ). In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content.  
 ***Archival, regular workshop papers:*** Authors should submit a paper up to 8 pages (both short and long papers are welcome), with unlimited pages for references, following the ACL author guidelines. The reported research should be substantially original. All submissions will be reviewed in a single track, regardless of length. Accepted papers will be presented as posters by default, and best papers may be given the opportunity for a brief talk to introduce their work. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymised. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings. Preference for oral presentation slots in the workshop will be given to archival papers.  
  Non-archival regular workshop papers: This is the same as the option above, but these papers will not appear in the proceedings and will typically only receive poster presentation slots. Non-archival submissions in this category will still undergo the review process. This is appropriate for nearly finished work that is intended for submission to another venue at a later date.  
 ***Non-archival cross-submissions:*** We also solicit cross-submissions, i.e., papers on relevant topics that have already appeared in other venues (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NLP, ML, or cognitive science venues, among others). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the AISD audience. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format, and the submission length is determined by the original venue. The paper selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee in a non-blind fashion. These papers will typically receive poster presentation slots.  
  In addition, we welcome papers on relevant topics that are under review or to be submitted to other venues (including the ACL 2024 main conference). These papers must follow the regular workshop paper format and will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Papers in this category will be reviewed by workshop reviewers.  
 Note to authors: While you submit your paper through OpenReview ( https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/AISD  ), please select the “Submission Type” properly based on the guidelines.  
 For questions about the submission guidelines, please contact workshop organizers via aisd-organizers  [at] googlegroups.com

  Contact Information 

 NAACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. NAACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.  
 As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2024 October cycle using the following link:  
 https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2024/October   
 Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2024 October cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to NAACL using the following link:  
 https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Conference   
 Note that this link will be available only two weeks before the commitment deadline.  
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload  
 As our pace of research continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here  . As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.  
 Submission Topic  
 NAACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:  
 Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics 
  Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
  Discourse and Pragmatics 
  Efficient/Low-resource Methods for NLP 
  Ethics, Bias, and Fairness 
  Generation 
  Human-centered NLP 
  Information Extraction 
  Information Retrieval and Text Mining 
  Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP 
  Language Modeling 
  Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics 
  Machine Learning for NLP 
  Machine Translation 
  Multilinguality and Language Diversity 
  Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond 
  Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation 
  Question Answering 
  Resources and Evaluation 
  Semantics: Lexical, Sentence-level, Textual Inference and Other areas 
  Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining 
  Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding 
  Summarization 
  Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing / ML 
  NLP Applications 
  Special Theme: NLP in a Multicultural World 
  NAACL 2025 Theme Track: NLP in a Multicultural World  
 Current NLP tools and models, especially LLMs, require vast amounts of data to train. However, the data used often favors only a handful of over-represented languages, and even for these majoritarian languages only some of the existing geographical or cultural varieties are considered, leaving a large tail of under-represented languages, varieties, and cultures that have had considerably less attention from the NLP community. In this year’s theme track we would like to focus on work providing support to the vibrant multicultural world we live in. We welcome papers in the following non-exhaustive list of topics:  
 Cultural localization of language models. 
  New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures. 
  Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages. 
  Analysis of cultural biases in language models. 
  Historical considerations and diachronic analysis. 
  Two Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to NAACL  
 NAACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review  (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review  platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., NAACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
  NAACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with the other *ACL 2025 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference, or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  
 Important Dates for NAACL 2025  
 15 Oct 2024: Submission deadline for ARR 2024 October 
  30 Oct 2024 - 18 Nov 2024: Reviewing period for ARR 2024 October 
  11 Nov 2024: Notification of desk rejection for submissions to ARR 2024 October that violate policy 
  22 Nov 2024 - 26 Nov 2024: Author response period for ARR 2024 October 
  12 Dec 2024: Reviews and meta-reviews released for ARR 2024 October 
  16 Dec 2024: Commitment deadline for NAACL 2025 
  22 Jan 2025: Notification of acceptance for NAACL 2025 
  8 Feb 2025: Deadline for accepted papers to withdraw from NAACL 2025 or Findings of NAACL 2025 
  8 Feb 2025: Deadline for accepted papers to upload of final version for NAACL 2025 or Findings of NAACL 2025 
  Note:  All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).  
 Following the ACL and ARR policies  , there is no anonymity period requirement.   
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., NAACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected NAACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to NAACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than NAACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to NAACL 2025.  
 Paper Submission Details  
 Both long and short paper submissions should follow all of the ARR submission requirements  , including:  
 Long Papers | (8 pages) and | Short Papers | (4 pages) 
  Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review 
  Authorship 
  Citation and Comparison 
  Multiple Submission Policy | , | Resubmission Policy | , and | Withdrawal Policy 
  Ethics Policy | including the | responsible NLP research checklist 
  Limitations 
  Writing Assistance 
  Paper Submission and Templates 
  Optional Supplementary Materials 
  Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.  
 Presentation at the Conference  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline of NAACL 2025 may be subject to desk rejection.  
 Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.

During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here  . As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.  
 Submission Topic  
 NAACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:  
 Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics

  Special Theme: NLP in a Multicultural World 
  NAACL 2025 Theme Track: NLP in a Multicultural World  
 Current NLP tools and models, especially LLMs, require vast amounts of data to train. However, the data used often favors only a handful of over-represented languages, and even for these majoritarian languages only some of the existing geographical or cultural varieties are considered, leaving a large tail of under-represented languages, varieties, and cultures that have had considerably less attention from the NLP community. In this year’s theme track we would like to focus on work providing support to the vibrant multicultural world we live in. We welcome papers in the following non-exhaustive list of topics:  
 Cultural localization of language models. 
  New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures. 
  Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages. 
  Analysis of cultural biases in language models. 
  Historical considerations and diachronic analysis. 
  Two Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to NAACL  
 NAACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review  (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review  platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., NAACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
  NAACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with the other *ACL 2025 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference, or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  
 Important Dates for NAACL 2025  
 15 Oct 2024: Submission deadline for ARR 2024 October

  Note:  All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).  
 Following the ACL and ARR policies  , there is no anonymity period requirement.   
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., NAACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected NAACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to NAACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than NAACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to NAACL 2025.

 The 8th International Conference on Machine Vision and Applications (ICMVA 2025)  
 We are pleased to announce that The 8th International Conference on Machine Vision and Applications (ICMVA 2025) is to be held in Melbourne, Australia during June 12-14, 2025.    The conference is sponsored by Swinburne University, University of Stuttgart, University of Tartu, supported by Okayama University  ,  University of Évora, Gifu Shotoku Gakuen University, and National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.   
   
 The field of machine vision and application, has been growing at a fast pace.   As in most fast-developing fields, not all aspects of machine vision that are of interest to active researchers are useful to the designers and users of a vision system for a specific application. This conference is intended to provide a balanced introduction to machine vision. Basic concepts and application are introduced and discussed with various essential mathematical elements etc onsite. The details to allow implementation and use of vision algorithm in practical application are provided, and engineering aspects of techniques are emphasized. The problems to apply machine vision are going to be solved.  
 What's more, the aim of this conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry, and to stimulate the exchange of knowledge through intensive discussions on the cutting-edge research topics listed below: Vision Sensing, Machine Vision Applications, Factory Automation and Robotics, Intelligent Transport Systems, Surveillance, Human Computer Interaction, Biomedical, Multimedia, and Life Science and Engineering, etc.     
 We hope that the conference results constituted significant contribution to the knowledge in these up to date scientific field.  The organizing committee of conference is pleased to invite prospective authors to submit their original manuscripts to ICMVA 2025.     
  
 Conference Proceedings  
 Any paper submitted for the conference is reviewed by at least two international reviewers with expertise in the relevant subject area.    
  Based on the reviewer’s comments, papers are accepted, rejected or accepted with revision. Accepted and registered Papers can be published in   Conference Proceedings   , which can be indexed by  EI Compendex, SCOPUS, etc.

 NAACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. NAACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.  
 As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2024 October cycle using the following link:  
 https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2024/October   
 Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2024 October cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to NAACL using the following link:  
 https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Conference   
 Note that this link will be available only two weeks before the commitment deadline.  
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload

  Special Theme: NLP in a Multicultural World 
  NAACL 2025 Theme Track: NLP in a Multicultural World  
 Current NLP tools and models, especially LLMs, require vast amounts of data to train. However, the data used often favors only a handful of over-represented languages, and even for these majoritarian languages only some of the existing geographical or cultural varieties are considered, leaving a large tail of under-represented languages, varieties, and cultures that have had considerably less attention from the NLP community. In this year’s theme track we would like to focus on work providing support to the vibrant multicultural world we live in. We welcome papers in the following non-exhaustive list of topics:  
 Cultural localization of language models. 
  New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures. 
  Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages. 
  Analysis of cultural biases in language models. 
  Historical considerations and diachronic analysis. 
  Two Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to NAACL

   ACL Rolling Review   
 A peer review platform for the Association for Computational Linguistics  

 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The purpose of ARR is to improve the efficiency, turnaround, and process consistency of ACL reviewing, while keeping the diversity (topical, geographic and otherwise) and iterative improvement through collaborative work with conference program chairs. ARR will use Open Review as its platform (but reviews will not be open in ARR). The reviewing and acceptance of papers for publication will be done in two steps:  
 Step 1 – Centralized Rolling Review: Authors submit papers to a unified review pool with deadlines every two months. Review is handled by an area chair (AC), and revision and resubmission of papers are allowed. 
  Step 2 – Commitment to a Publication Venue: A publication venue is a conference or workshop that accepts reviews from ARR. When an opportunity to commit to a publication venue comes around, authors may submit papers with fully completed reviews (including meta reviews). Program chairs decide the process for committing ARR reviewed papers, as well as the criteria and process for deciding to accept a subset of these submissions into their event. 
  SCOPE OF SUBMISSIONS  
 All topics in Computational Linguistics / Natural Language Processing are welcome at ARR. At submission, papers must select a topic area to assist with AC and reviewer matching. The current set of areas are (in alphabetical order):  
 Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics 
  Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
  Discourse and Pragmatics 
  Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP 
  Ethics, Bias, and Fairness 
  Generation 
  Human-centered NLP 
  Information Extraction 
  Information Retrieval and Text Mining 
  Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP 
  Language Modeling 
  Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics 
  Machine Learning for NLP 
  Machine Translation 
  Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP 
  Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond 
  NLP Applications 
  Phonology, Morphology, and Word Segmentation 
  Question Answering 
  Resources and Evaluation 
  Semantics: Lexical and Sentence-Level 
  Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining 
  Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech and Spoken Language Understanding 
  Summarization 
  Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing 
  Theme tracks (proposed by participating publication venues and specific to those venues) 
  For more information about how to choose the right area, see this page  .  
 ARR welcomes diverse types of contributions in the above areas. When making a submission at ARR, the authors can indicate one or more of the following contribution types that their submission is making:  
 Approaches to low-resource settings 
  Approaches low compute settings-efficiency 
  Data resources 
  Data analysis 
  Model analysis & interpretability 
  NLP engineering experiment 
  Publicly available software and/or pre-trained models 
  Position papers 
  Reproduction study 
  Surveys (all papers are expected to include reviews of related literature. This category is meant for the papers that go beyond that, e.g. in scope or in establishing new interdisciplinary connections) 
  Theory 
  Both positive and negative results for experimental studies are welcome, and have the same challenge of justifying to the program committee why this particular result is interesting and important. A negative results paper might report on non-reproducibility or non-generalizability of previously published results, their misattribution (‘right for the wrong reasons’), or present an idea that seemed great (for well-justified reasons), but didn’t work.  
 ARR welcomes scholars from other communities who make a substantive contribution to the computational processing of language. Here are some points to keep in mind for a successful submission:  
 Interdisciplinary submissions typically aim to introduce concepts/methods/theories from one community to the CL/NLP community. 
  For machine learning application papers on areas other than language, if the authors feel that their work fits the NLP applications track (e.g. because it finds a new application for a language model), they are welcome to try to convince the reviewers and area chairs that their work should be presented in this venue. 
  A good rule-of-thumb to consider whether your work is connected to a given community is to consider whether your list of references has a substantial proportion of papers from that community. 
  PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION  
 Long Papers  
 Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Long papers may consist of:  
 up to eight (8) pages of content 
  unlimited extra space after the conclusion for limitations (required, see below) and optionally ethical considerations 
  plus unlimited pages of references 
  Submissions that exceed the length requirements, or are missing a limitations section, will be desk rejected.  
 Short Papers  
 Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a small, focused contribution that can be made in a few pages. Some common kinds of short papers are (non-)reproduction reports, negative results, opinion pieces, interesting application nuggets (but all these types of contributions could also be presented in long papers, given sufficient substance).  
 Short papers may consist of:  
 up to four (4) pages of content 
  unlimited extra space after the conclusion for limitations (required, see below) and optionally ethical considerations 
  plus unlimited pages of references 
  Submissions that exceed the length requirements, or are missing a limitations section, will be desk rejected.  
 Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review  
 Papers must not include authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the authors’ identities, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991)…” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)…” Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers.  
 Supplementary materials, including any links to repositories, should also be anonymized. This includes author responses during the review process. Links to file hosting services that can track downloads, such as Dropbox, are not allowed.  
 Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.  
 ARR is subject to the ACL Policies for Review and Citation  , which were updated in early 2024. Beginning with the February 15, 2024 ARR deadlines, there is no anonymity period or limitation on posting or discussing non-anonymous preprints while the work is under peer review. However, the new policy  incentivizes anonymous submissions by special paper awards and priority in acceptance decisions for borderline papers.  
 Authorship  
 The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to ARR will be notified of submissions and reviews. Please refer to the new ACL policy publication ethics  for authorship criteria.  
 Please notice that once the paper has been submitted, no changes to the list of authors are allowed. There are additional authorship rules for resubmissions (see below).  
 Citation and Comparison  
 Authors are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to their submission but may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited).  
 In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited in addition to or instead of the preprint version.  
 Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to a submission, and authors are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.  
 For more information, see the ACL Policies for Review and Citation  .  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 There are several cases to consider:  
 ARR + Other Venue | : ARR precludes multiple submissions. ARR will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the ARR review period. This policy covers all journals and refereed and archival conferences and workshops without exception (e.g., TACL, Computational Linguistics, IJCAI, SIGIR, AAAI, ICASSP, ICML, NeurIPS, etc). In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, without exception. 
  ARR + Commitment | : The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. That means (a) while in an active review cycle at ARR, a paper cannot be committed to a conference, and (b) between commitment to a conference and a decision or withdrawal, a paper cannot be submitted to ARR. For example, if you got reviews in the June 2023 cycle, you cannot both commit to EMNLP (August 22nd deadline) and submit a revised version to the August 2023 ARR cycle. Note that this is a change of policy relative to the early days of ARR, when this type of dual submission was permitted for ACL and NAACL 2022. 
  Commitment + Commitment/Other Venue | : Whether you can commit/submit to two venues simultaneously depends on the dual submission policies of those venues. Typically, it is not permitted. 
  ARR + ARR | : For the sake of clarity, this policy also covers ARR itself; authors may not resubmit to ARR work that is already under review to ARR. As of 2023, ARR does not have overlapping cycles, and so this is a moot point. 
  Submissions that violate requirements 1, 2, or 4 will be desk rejected.  
 Resubmission Policy  
 Authors may resubmit to ACL Rolling Review.  
 When resubmitting, the | authors must provide a link to the previous submission | . Any paper previously submitted that does not acknowledge its earlier version will be desk rejected. To count as a new paper rather than a revision, the submission must be on a sufficiently different topic that the prior reviews no longer apply (e.g., further improving the proposed methods or extending the set of experiments or analysis does not qualify, nor does extending a short paper to a long one). Please note that resubmission does | not | mean that papers are stuck with old reviewers: revised papers can still be sent to new reviewers and meta-reviewers on authors’ request (see below), with the authors indicating why they prefer that option. 
  To reduce the workload for the ACs and reviewers, and to focus the new reviews on the changes, the | authors must provide a summary of changes and revisions | in response to reviews from the previous round. For the latter, there should be an overview of changes and a point-by-point response to each weakness and suggestion from all reviewers (including meta-review where relevant), either describing the revision or arguing against it. It is recommended to refer to the location of revisions using section and line numbers. Some authors find it useful to color-code the changed parts in the text of the submission; this is allowed, but not mandated. A color-coded version of the paper may be included with the explanation of revisions in the same PDF. 
  Resubmissions must be modified versions of the original submission that address issues raised by the reviewers and meta-review; the authors may not simply resubmit the exact same paper, nor may they submit a completely new paper as if it were a resubmission. Resubmissions that ignore relevant feedback provided during the previous review round can be desk rejected by the EiC team. 
  If the authors want to add an author as part of a resubmission, they may do so with a (brief) justification; except in extremely rare circumstances, authors may not be removed. 
  Resubmitted papers will go back to the original reviewers and area chair, where possible, unless the authors request new reviewers or AC (with justification, e.g. violations of reviewer guidelines). Note that new reviewers are instructed to form their own view of the paper first: they only see the previous reviews and author explanation of revisions after they submit their initial reviews. See the information for authors ( | https://aclrollingreview.org/authors#step4 | ) for further discussion. 
  Submissions that had previously received very low evaluation from reviewers and a meta-review score of 1 generally need a wholesale revision that can be expected to take a lot of time. We reserve the right to desk reject such resubmissions if they are sent back to ARR within 6 months of the original submission without such a revision.  
 Authors considering a resubmission should also refer to the withdrawal policy  below.  
 Withdrawal Policy  
 Authors may withdraw their submission at any time. However, a submission that is withdrawn more than 48 hours after the submission deadline may not be resubmitted until the second subsequent ARR cycle, so withdrawing after this time requires contacting the ACs.  
 Once the submission receives the ARR meta-review, it is no longer considered under review, and can be submitted or committed elsewhere with no restrictions. There is no need to withdraw a meta-reviewed paper to resubmit to ARR or commit to a conference that accepts ARR reviews. When resubmitting a revised version, please follow the resubmission policy above.  
 Once a paper receives even one review at ARR, it cannot be simply withdrawn and submitted as a new publication.  If you intend to resubmit to ARR, do not  withdraw the previous version. Simply resubmit following the above resubmission policy.  
 Ethics Policy  
 Authors are required to honour the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics  .  
 The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Authors are encouraged to devote a section of their paper to concerns about the ethical impact of the work and to a discussion of broader impacts of the work, which will be taken into account in the review process. This discussion does not count towards the page limit, as long as it is placed in the end of the paper. In addition, we provide a responsible NLP research checklist  , which authors must complete as part of their paper submission. The content of checklists is used in the review process, and incorrect or misleading information in the checklist can result in desk rejection. Furthermore, ACL’25 will resume the publication of responsible NLP checklists for accepted papers for improving the overall transparency of the scientific process.  
 We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work. Indeed, the ARR review form includes a section addressing these issues and papers flagged for ethical concerns by reviewers or ACs will be further reviewed by the Ethics Advisory Committee (EAC).  
 AI Writing/Coding Assistance Policy  
 Generally, generative AI tools do not qualify for authorship. Their use for writing or coding, as well as its scope, must be disclosed in the Acknowledgements section, as well as flagged in the Responsible NLP Checklist. For coding, details may also be included in the README files.  
 ARR follows the new ACL Policy on AI Writing Assistance  , which recognizes the following cases are recognized as appropriate use of such tools:  
 a. | Assistance purely with the language of the paper. | This covers models used for paraphrasing or polishing the author’s original content, rather than for suggesting new content—similar to tools like grammar checkers, spell checkers, dictionaries, and synonym tools. The use of tools that only assist with proofreading, like grammar or spell checkers, does not need to be disclosed. 
  b. | Short-form input assistance. | This covers predictive keyboards or tools that offer suggestions during typing, that might be powered by generative language models. The use of such tools does not need to be disclosed. 
  c. | Literature search. | This covers search assistants, e.g., to identify relevant literature. The usual requirements for citation accuracy and thoroughness of literature reviews apply. 
  d. | Low-novelty text. | This covers the automatic generation of text about pre-existing ideas. Authors should specify where such automatically generated text was used, and convince the reviewers that the generation was checked to be accurate and is accompanied by relevant and appropriate citations. If the generation copies text from existing work, the publication ethics policy applies to that text. Authors need (for example) to acknowledge all relevant citations: both the source of the text used and the source of the idea(s). 
  e. | New ideas. | This covers when generative model output reads to the authors as new research ideas that would deserve co-authorship or acknowledgment from a human colleague (e.g., topics to discuss, framing of the problem), which the authors then develop themselves. As with all new ideas, the authors should conduct a literature search to determine relevant prior work and cite to ensure proper credit. The authors should disclose if models were used in this manner. 
  f. | New ideas + new text. | ACL does not consider a generative model to be an entity that can fulfill the requirements of co-authorship. 
  In all cases, all  authors are fully responsible for the correctness of their methods, results, and writing. They should check for potential plagiarism, both of text and code.  
 Limitations (required section)  
 Authors are required to discuss the limitations of their work in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section should be included at the end of the paper, before the references, and it will not count toward the page limit. This includes both, long and short papers. Papers without a limitations section will be desk rejected. Note, prior to the December 2023 cycle, this was optional.  
 Please note that this section should not introduce new methods, analysis, or results. We reserve the right to desk reject the submissions that use this section to introduce more content that should have been part of the main paper. It can only discuss the limitations of the work presented in the main content of the paper.  
 Reviewing Requirements  
 Submitting to ARR comes with a reviewing requirement. A t least one author must participate in the review process  , unless an exception applies (e.g., every author is either new to the community, has insufficient experience, or is already serving in another capacity). Papers that do not meet this requirement, and are not covered by an exception, may be desk rejected. There are of course legitimate reasons for one to suddenly be unavailable to review, and we will respect these (e.g. already serving in ARR in another capacity).  
 Authors who will review are nominated at submission time. They must:  
 Have an updated OpenReview profile, including affiliation, semantic scholar link, dblp link, ACL anthology link, and an email address where they can receive OpenReview messages. See | here | for how to maximize the likelihood of well-matched review assignments. 
  Have published at least three papers in the main computational linguistics and NLP venues in the last 5 years. (we consider publication history recorded at ACL anthology, which covers AACL/IJCNLP, ACL, CL, COLING, CONLL, EACL, EMNLP, NAACL, LREC, and TACL). Both short and long papers count, as do Findings papers.) 
  Once added as a reviewer, the new reviewers must complete their reviewer registration form for the cycle and set their availability to at least 4 papers within 48 hours. 
  The nominated authors who already have ARR reviewer profiles must also set their load for the current cycle to at least 4 papers per submission, prior to submission. In case of the same research group submitting multiple papers, it is the authors’ responsibility to coordinate within the group and ensure that either different senior authors are nominated, or the senior author undertakes a proportionately higher review load and will | mentor junior subreviewers | . 
  All reviewers must familiarize themselves with the latest version of the | ARR reviewer guidelines | and perform the reviews on time and in line with ARR requirements. 
  The number of papers assigned to each reviewer in a given cycle depends in part on the paper matching process. To mitigate the issue of overwhelming volume of assignments, ARR has implemented a load balance check across cycles. Please note that even with four assigned papers, contributing four reviews doesn’t fully reciprocate the volunteer effort that the authors receive for their submission to complete a full review cycle (it involves not just three reviews and a meta-review from the AC, potentially with emergency substitutions, but also effort from the SACs and PCs during paper commitment).  
 See this blog post  for further information about this requirement (as of April 2024).  
 Paper Submission Process, Criteria and Templates  
 Submission is electronic, using the OpenReview.net platform. All long, short, and theme papers must follow the ACL Author Guidelines  . Here  are the paper submission form fields for your reference.  
 ARR provides a submission checklist  . The checklist is intended as a reminder to help authors improve the quality of their papers, and decrease the risk of a desk rejection.  
 Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available here  (Latex and Word). Please follow the paper formatting guidelines general to “*ACL” conferences available here  . Authors may not modify these style files or use templates designed for other conferences.  
 Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.  
 Here  is the current version of the review form, and here  is the current version of the AC meta-review form. These forms will be re-assessed and updated periodically.  
 Desk Rejection  
 Papers can be desk-rejected for a variety of reasons, including format and anonymity violations, dual submissions, and self-plagiarism (significant overlap in content with other submissions or publications by the same authors). We provide authors with a checklist  to assist with avoiding some of the common issues (the list is not exhaustive).  
 Starting from December 2024, ARR will also enforce desk rejections for incorrect or misleading filing of the responsible NLP checklist, and for violating the resubmissions policy (i.e. submissions that are not accompanied with either revisions in response to prior reviews, or justifications for not doing so, as described in the section on resubmissions).  
 Note that while we do our best for the bulk of desk rejections to happen before the start of the review process, sometimes serious problems are missed at initial checks and discovered late. Hence, desk-rejections can happen at any time in the review cycle.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software, and Data  
 ARR encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. Supplementary materials may include appendices, software, or data. For example, pre-processing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into appendices.  
 However, reviewers are not required to consider material in appendices. If the pseudo-code, or derivations, or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper rather than appendices.  
 Appendices should come after the references in the submitted pdf. They do not count towards the page limit. Software should be submitted as a single .tgz or .zip archive, and data as a separate single .tgz or .zip archive. Supplementary materials must be fully anonymized to preserve the two-way anonymized reviewing policy.  
 If supplementary software is provided through a link to an online repository, it should be properly anonymized (e.g., Anonymous GitHub  ). Links to cloud services like Google Drive, Dropbox etc. are not acceptable, as they might track the download activity.

 Workshops and Tutorials  
 Go to: workshops  | tutorials   
 MUM 2024, the 23rd International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia  will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, December 1st - 4th.  
 Workshops  
 The International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia (MUM 2024) welcomes proposals for workshops. A MUM Workshop is a forum for attendees with shared interests to present, discuss, and develop new ideas around a specific theme or domain  related to Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia. It is the perfect opportunity for putting the best minds in the field together to build new communities, to explore new ideas, and to develop emerging topics.  
 All workshops will take place on Sunday, the first day of the conference (Seminar rooms with equipment will be provided), on the 1st of December  . Because workshops are meant to encourage ideas exchange, we encourage proposals that go beyond being a mini-conference and that engage participants in hands-on activities and in discussion. We also encourage organisers to open the workshops to conference attendees without a workshop paper, but who would be interested in participating.  
 For the first time at MUM, workshop proposals will be peer-reviewed and archived in the ACM digital library. By that, we hope to attract a higher number of high-quality workshops at MUM.   
 If you are interested in submitting a proposal and wish to discuss your ideas prior to the submission deadline, the workshop chairs welcome any inquiries. You can contact us at workshoptutorial2024@mum-conf.org  .  
 Workshop proposal submissions should be in the ACM Primary Article Template  . Submissions should be 6 pages or less  (excluding references), describing your goals for the workshop, how you plan to run the workshop, and any anticipated long-term outcomes that will impact the field. Additionally, include information on how you will publish your call and reach out to potential participants. Workshop proposal submissions contain an abstract that is less than 150 words long that clearly states the purpose of the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed by experts in the field. Submissions must be submitted via EasyChair   . Please select Workshops and Tutorials track in EasyChair   . Accepted workshop proposals will be included in the conference proceedings published by ACM Press and included in the ACM Digital Library.  

 Submission deadline | October 4th, 2024 (AoE) 
 Notification of acceptance | October 9th, 2024 (AoE) 
  
 Recommended timeline for internal workshops submissions  

 Workshop submission deadline | October 28th, 2024 (AoE) 
 Notification | November 11th, 2024 (AoE) 
  
 Upon Acceptance of your MUM Workshop or Tutorial  
 Workshop organisers will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the notification date. 
  Final acceptances for participants’ submissions must be completed by the acceptance deadline. This will give participants enough time for early registration to the conference. 
  Before the Conference  
 Organisers of the accepted workshops are responsible for the following tasks during the time leading up to the conference:  
 Announce/disseminate their Workshop: Organisers of an accepted workshop must set up and maintain their own website in which they provide further and updated information about their workshop. The workshop page will be linked to from the official MUM workshop site. 
  Solicit Submissions from Potential Participants: While some organizers may choose alternate formats, a position paper is generally 2-4 pages long and outlines the submitter’s view on the workshop theme and the reasons for the submitter’s interest in the topic. Proceedings of the workshop's submissions will be in charge of the workshop organizers. Commonly, the workshop's proceedings are included on each workshop's webpage. 
  Select Participants: Choose participants on the basis of position papers submitted and your goals for the workshop. 
  Workshop organizers and participants have to register for the conference. 
  Provide a Participant List: A list of confirmed participants should be sent to the Workshop & Tutorials Chairs ( | workshoptutorial2024@mum-conf.org | ). 
  Develop a final agenda of workshop activities. 
  Develop a plan for any follow-up activities. 
   
 Previous Workshops at MUM  
 Some example workshops from previous years include:  
 Tangible Web: Supporting Mobile and Cross-Device Interactions 
  Mixed Reality Applications for In-Vehicle Experiences in Automated Driving 
  Workshop on Amplified and Memorable Food Interactions 
  Character Computing: Computer Science meets Psychology 
   
 Tutorials  
 The International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia (MUM 2024) welcomes proposals for tutorials. We invite academic and industry leaders in all topics related to Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia to submit a proposal following the guidelines below. We encourage proposals that include practical activities inside and outside the classroom.  
 All tutorials will take place on the Sunday before the conference, on the 1st of December  and you can choose between three formats: 90min, half-day, or full-day. If you are interested in submitting a proposal and wish to discuss your ideas prior to the submission deadline, the workshop chairs welcome any inquiries. You can contact us at workshoptutorial2024@mum-conf.org  .  
 Tutorial proposal submissions should be in the ACM Primary Article Template  . Submissions should be 6 pages or less  (excluding references), and include the following details:

  Papers should be grounded in existing literature and knowledge, and should be written for an interdisciplinary audience. Papers must be submitted via EasyChair  by August 29th, 2024, AoE  at the latest. Accepted papers will appear in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide. The correct template for submissions is the ACM Primary Article Template in single-column format (in PDF format). Submissions should be prepared using either the single-column Word Submission Template or the single-column LaTeX template  (using the “manuscript, review, anonymous” style available in the template). Submissions can be of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution, with 16 pages (excluding references) in single-column format being valued as long papers in past editions and 7 pages (excluding references) in single-column format being valued as short papers in past editions.  
 Successful submissions of around 16 pages typically represent significant empirical, theoretical, or methodological advances in the field. 
  Successful submissions of around 7 pages offer more focused contributions; they are not intended to be work-in-progress reports. Instead, they should offer complete, rigorously developed work with a solid contribution to the field. Short papers have a smaller scope or more focused contribution than long papers. 
  Please note that the maximum length for full papers is 16 pages, and the maximum length for short papers is 7 pages. 
  Submissions should not have been previously published or be concurrently under submission. Papers must be anonymized. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind review process managed by the Program Chairs. Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers, chosen from the pool of members of the Program Committee listed below. This pool of reviewers features experts from the previous edition and new researchers to address new emerging research areas and underrepresented communities. Papers will be assigned through a bidding process. Authors are encouraged to submit an optional video of a maximum of 6 minutes to support their submission. To ensure all reviewers can view videos, authors should use the H.264 encoding and the MP4 file format. The bit rate of videos can be lowered to accommodate the upload limits of EasyChair (max. 50 MB per file).  
 Link to Submission System: EasyChair   
 Reviewing Process  
 There will be a single round of reviews with three potential outcomes: desk-rejects  (papers that are significantly out of scope, not written in English, etc.), rejection, and conditional acceptance  . No rebuttal phase is planned. Authors of conditionally accepted papers will find in the reviews a list of revisions and requested changes they need to satisfy to have their paper be officially accepted into the program. Accepted papers will follow the ACM TAPS workflow instructions  , and at least one author from each accepted paper must register to the conference.

 Mensch und Computer 2024 and Look-Ahead to MuC 2025 in Chemnitz  
 2024-09-11   
  Our team from TU Chemnitz recently gathered at the Mensch und Computer 2024 (MuC 2024) conference, held at the KIT in Karlsruhe, Germany. This year's event was an inspiring journey through the diverse world of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), bringing together open-minded individuals to engage in critical discussions on current and future trends.  
  MuC 2024 stands out not only as the largest HCI conference in Europe but also as a unique blend of academic research and practical industry insights, with participation from organizations like the German UPA. After days of insightful sessions, we continued our discussions in the local pubs of Karlsruhe, fostering deeper connections in a more relaxed setting.  
  We deeply appreciate Prof. Dr. Alexander Maedche, Kathrin Gerling, and their team for organizing this event, which offered a welcoming environment for sharing experiences and networking. It was a fantastic opportunity to explore topics from User Experience (UX) to the complex relationships between humans, technology, and society.  
  We are excited to announce that Mensch und Computer 2025 (MuC 2025) will be hosted at TU Chemnitz. As Chemnitz becomes the European Cultural Capital (Kulturhauptstadt) in 2025, we will welcome the HCI community to explore "Digital Diversity" and continue the conversations started this year in Karlsruhe.  
  Stay tuned for more information on how to get involved with MuC2025 and join us in shaping the future of HCI! The website for next year is currently under construction and you can get to it here  .

  Frequently Asked Questions 
  Industry Track Chairs 

 Language technologies and their applications are an integral and critical part of our daily lives. The development of many of these technologies trace their roots to academic and industrial research laboratories where researchers invented a plethora of algorithms, benchmarked them against shared datasets and perfected the performance of these algorithms to provide plausible solutions to real-world applications. While a controlled laboratory setting is vital for a deeper scientific understanding of the problems underlying language technologies and the impact of algorithmic design choices on the performance of a technology, transitioning the technology to real-world industrial-strength applications raises a different and challenging set of technical issues.  
 We invite submissions describing innovations and implementations in all areas of speech and natural language processing technologies and systems that are relevant to real-word applications. The primary focus of this track is on papers that advance the understanding of, and demonstrate the effective handling of, practical issues related to the deployment of language processing technologies in non-trivial real-world systems. By “non-trivial real-world system” we mean an application that is deployed for real-world use, i.e., outside controlled environments such as laboratories, classrooms or experimental crowd-sourced setups, and that uses natural language processing (including speech technology), even if not state-of-the-art in terms of research. There is no requirement that the system be made by a for-profit company, but the users of the system are most likely outside the NLP research community.

 Paper submission deadline | December 2, 2024  December 7, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance | February 5, 2025 
 Camera-ready version of papers due | February 14, 2025 
 Main conference, including industry track | April 30–May 2, 2025 
  
 Following the ACL and ARR policies  , there is no anonymity period requirement.  
 Topics of Interest  
 The industry track welcomes submissions describing innovations and implementations of applications in all areas of speech and natural language processing, ranging from early prototypes to production-ready systems. With the rapid development observed recently in Generative Ai and large language models (LLM), this year we are particularly encouraging submissions of papers leveraging this technology to develop real-world applications. We also welcome papers describing publicly available open-source or open-access systems. The focus of this track is on papers that advance the understanding of, and demonstrate the effective handling of, practical issues related to the deployment of language processing technologies in real-world systems. There is no requirement that systems are for commercial use or not. This track provides an opportunity to highlight the key insights and new research challenges that arise from real world implementations. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following (in alphabetical order):  
 Best practices and lessons learned 
  Continuous maintenance and improvement of deployed systems 
  Case studies from design to deployment 
  Design of application-relevant datasets 
  Ethics and bias in deployed NLP systems 
  Handling unexpected user behavior 
  Implementation at speed, scale, and low-cost 
  Negative results related to real-world applications 
  Novel previously unsolved NLP problems 
  Offline and online system evaluation methodologies 
  Online learning for deployed systems 
  Robustness against various perturbations in deployed systems 
  System combination and hybridization 
  In addition, opinion/vision papers related to real-world applications are also welcome. 
  Submissions must clearly identify one of the following three areas they fall into:  
 Deployed | : Must describe a system that solves a non-trivial real-world problem. The focus may include describing the problem related to actual use cases, its significance (against opportunity size, value proposition, and ideal end state), design/formulation of methods, tradeoff design decision for solutions, deployment challenges, and lessons learned. 
  Emerging | : Must describe the development of a system that solves a non-trivial real-world problem (it need not be deployed or even close, but there needs to be evidence that this development is intended for real-world deployment). Papers that describe enabling infrastructure for large-scale deployment of natural language processing techniques also fall in this category. 
  Discovery | : Must include results obtained from NLP applications in real world scenarios that result in actionable insights. These discoveries should reveal promising directions in their application areas, leading to further system or societal enhancements. For example, an actionable discovery from an analysis of call center transcripts may reveal that certain language choices negatively impact customer experience, leading to better training of service representatives and improved customer experience. 
  Evaluation Criteria  
 Submissions will be reviewed in a double-blind manner and assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. Submissions in the industry track should emphasize real-world implementations of natural language processing systems, the development of such systems, or provide insights based on real-world datasets with obvious industry impact. For papers that rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental methods and results should be clear, well executed, and repeatable (though the data may be proprietary).  
 Paper submission  
 Submission  
 Authors are invited to submit original, full-length (6 page) industry track papers that are not previously published, accepted to be published, or under consideration for publication in any other forum. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically, in PDF format and formatted using NAACL 2025 formatting requirements. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review. Industry Track papers cannot exceed 6 pages in length; however, references do not count toward the 6-page limit, nor do the following optional sections: acknowledgements (only in the final version), ethical considerations, and appendices. Appendices may include, for example, pre-processing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, information about user studies, additional errors analysis and other details that are necessary for the replication of the work described in the paper. In addition, authors may submit a separate file with supplementary materials such as software or data. Note that the 6-page paper needs to remain fully self-contained: appendices and supplementary material are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them.  
 The papers should be submitted through the NAACL 2025 industry track online submission system in Open Review.  
 Final Version  
 Accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 7 pages; ethical considerations, acknowledgements and references do not count against this limit) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. Previous presentations of the work (e.g., preprints on arXiv.org) should be indicated in a footnote that should be excluded from the review submission, but included in the final version of papers appearing in the NAACL 2025 proceedings.  
 The final version should remove anonymization in text, citation, and figures. For example, the final version may include the name of the authors’ institutions, trade names, and screenshots of identifiable products.  
 In addition to the final version of the paper, authors of all papers accepted to the Industry Track will be given an option to submit a presentation video, slides, and/or a pdf of their poster.  
 Presentation Requirement for Accepted Papers  
 Industry track papers will be presented orally or as posters to be determined by the program committee. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference (either via online or onsite presence). All papers accepted to the Industry Track must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings, and at least one author must register for NAACL 2025. The Industry Track paper sessions will run in parallel with the regular research paper sessions of the conference.  
 Presentation Mode  
 Accepted papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters.  
 Authorship  
 The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to NAACL 2025 Industry Track will be notified of submissions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to NAACL 2025 Industry Track after the paper submission deadline.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 NAACL 2025 will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the NAACL 2025 review period. This policy covers all refereed and archival conferences and workshops (e.g., NeurIPS, ACL workshops), as well as ACL Rolling Reviews (ARR). In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL 2025 must ensure that their submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.  
 Submissions of identical or closely related work to multiple NAACL 2025 tracks (e.g., to research track and industry track) will be treated as duplicate submissions. Such submissions violating the multiple submission policy will be rejected without review. The authors should also include the papers that their paper overlaps or extends in the references section as follows: Anonymous Authors  , “ Title of the paper  ”, Under submission at NAACL 2025 (TRACK NAME)  .  
 Ethics Policy  
 Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics  . The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work.  
 Authors will be allowed extra space after the 6th page for an optional broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics. The NAACL review form will include a section addressing these issues and papers flagged for ethical concerns by reviewers or Senior Area Chairs will be further reviewed by an ethics committee. Note that an ethical considerations section is not required, but papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks that do not discuss these issues will not be accepted. Conversely, the mere inclusion of an ethical considerations section does not guarantee acceptance. In addition to acceptance or rejection, papers may receive a conditional acceptance recommendation. Camera-ready versions of papers designated as conditional accept will be re-reviewed by the ethics committee to determine whether the concerns have been adequately addressed. Please read the Ethics FAQ  for more guidance on some problems to look out for and key concerns to consider relative to the code of ethics.  
 Frequently Asked Questions  
 Is the industry track only for participants from industry?   
 No, the industry track welcomes participants from the entire ACL community. Researchers working on real-world applications that match the industry track call for papers are invited to submit papers. Everyone is welcome to attend industry track sessions.  
 What do you mean by real-world applications?   
 We are looking for applications that are deployed (or expected to be deployed) for real-world use, i.e., outside controlled environments such as laboratories or experimental crowd-sourced setups.  
 Can students also submit papers to industry track?   
 Yes! If your work matches the industry track call for papers, consider submitting a paper to the industry track.  
 Will the papers in the industry track be published in the proceedings?   
 Yes, industry track papers will be published as a separate volume of the proceedings. For example, see the EMNLP 2022 proceedings.  
 I work in industry. Can I still submit my paper to the research track?   
 Absolutely. The industry track offers a forum to submit papers describing aspects of real-world applications that may differ in focus from the research track reviewing criteria.  
 How do I decide whether to submit to the research track or the industry track?   
 Papers describing key lessons learned and challenges pertaining to real-world deployment of NLP and speech technologies are best suited for industry track. Authors are advised to review the call for papers for both tracks and submit to the track that best matches your work. The list of topics and reviewing criteria may be helpful. You can also reach out to the track chairs if you need help deciding.  
 When should I submit to the Industry Track vs. the NLP Applications Track in the Research Track?   
 The NLP Applications area of the Research Track is a potential alternative venue to publish applied NLP research. Consider the following questions when deciding where to submit: (1) Does the paper include experiments only  on proprietary data? If so, the Industry Track might be a better fit. (2) Is the main contribution of the paper related to a deployment aspect of the application, such as considerations of speed, robustness, usability, or some problem that was discovered during deployment that your results begin to address but more research effort would be required to solve more comprehensively? If so, the Industry Track might be a better fit. (3) Does the paper report new state-of-the-art on a task that is likely to be feasible and interesting outside of your specific setting? If so, the NLP Applications Track might be a better fit. (4) Is your system evaluated only on usability subjects? If so, the NLP Applications Track might be a better fit.

  Contact Information 

 NAACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. NAACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.  
 As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2024 October cycle using the following link:  
 https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2024/October   
 Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2024 October cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to NAACL using the following link:  
 https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Conference   
 Note that this link will be available only two weeks before the commitment deadline.  
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload  
 As our pace of research continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here  . As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.  
 Submission Topic  
 NAACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:  
 Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics 
  Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
  Discourse and Pragmatics 
  Efficient/Low-resource Methods for NLP 
  Ethics, Bias, and Fairness 
  Generation 
  Human-centered NLP 
  Information Extraction 
  Information Retrieval and Text Mining 
  Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP 
  Language Modeling 
  Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics 
  Machine Learning for NLP

  Summarization 
  Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing / ML 
  NLP Applications 
  Special Theme: NLP in a Multicultural World 
  NAACL 2025 Theme Track: NLP in a Multicultural World  
 Current NLP tools and models, especially LLMs, require vast amounts of data to train. However, the data used often favors only a handful of over-represented languages, and even for these majoritarian languages only some of the existing geographical or cultural varieties are considered, leaving a large tail of under-represented languages, varieties, and cultures that have had considerably less attention from the NLP community. In this year’s theme track we would like to focus on work providing support to the vibrant multicultural world we live in. We welcome papers in the following non-exhaustive list of topics:  
 Cultural localization of language models. 
  New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures. 
  Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages. 
  Analysis of cultural biases in language models. 
  Historical considerations and diachronic analysis. 
  Two Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to NAACL  
 NAACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review  (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review  platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., NAACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
  NAACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with the other *ACL 2025 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference, or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  
 Important Dates for NAACL 2025

  Workshop Timelines 
  Workshop Chairs 

 The Association for Computational Linguistics, the European Language Resource Association and International Committee on Computational Linguistics invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with ACL 2025, NAACL 2025, or EMNLP 2025. We solicit proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines such as linguistics, speech, information retrieval, and multimodal processing.  
 Workshops will be held at one of the following conference venues:  
 NAACL 2025 | (The 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics), which will be a hybrid conference, and physically held in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA from April 29 - May 4, 2025 
  ACL 2025 | (The 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics) which will be held as a hybrid conference, and physically held in Vienna, Austria from July 27 - August 1, 2025 
  EMNLP 2025 (The 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing) which will be held as a hybrid conference, with the physical location and dates to be confirmed. 
  The workshop and tutorial co-chairs will work together to assign workshops to the four conferences. They will take into account location preferences and technical constraints provided by the workshop proposers.  
 Important Dates  
 NAACL/ACL/EMNLP 2025 shared dates:  
  
 Proposal submission deadline | October 1, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance | October 23, 2024 
  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).  
 Submission Information  
 Proposals should be submitted as PDF documents. Note that submissions should be ready to be turned into a Call for Papers to the workshop within one week of notification.  
 The proposals should be at most two pages for the main proposal and at most two additional pages for information about the organizers, program committee, and references. Thus, the whole proposal should not be more than four pages long. Please use the LaTeX template  for your submission.  
 The two pages for the main proposal must include:  
 A title, short name / acronym, and a brief description of the workshop topic and content. 
  A list of invited speakers, if applicable, with an indication of which ones have already agreed and which are indicative, and sources of funding for the speakers. 
  Some conferences might take place only or partially virtually. We request submissions to contain a brief discussion on measures planned to make sure a workshop is successful and productive in case of a hybrid or virtual-only attendance. 
  (Optional) A description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop, and estimate of the number of participants. Having a shared task is optional. 
  A description of special requirements and technical needs. 
  The preferred venue(s) (ACL / NAACL / EMNLP), if any, and description of any constraints (e.g., if the workshop is compatible with only one of these events, logistically, thematically or otherwise, or if the workshop cannot be held at a venue for logistical reasons). While we will do our best to adhere to these preferences, we cannot guarantee that preferences will be satisfied. 
  Diversity and Inclusion Efforts (see more details below) 
  If the workshop has been held before, a note specifying where previous workshops were held, how many submissions the workshop received and how many papers were accepted (also specify if they were not regular papers, e.g., shared task system description papers), and an estimate of how many in-person posters the workshop attracted. 
  The submission form will request information that does not factor into the decision process, but are necessary for logistical reasons:  
 An estimate of the number of attendees maximum at one given time 
  Number of estimated in-person posters 
  Preferred Venue (first and second preference) 
  Duration of the workshop (1-day / 2-day workshop) 
  Note that the only financial support available to workshops is a single free workshop registration for an invited speaker. The workshop organizers must bear all other costs independently, including registration for more than one invited speaker.  
 The two pages for information about organizers, program committee, and references must include:  
 The names, affiliations, and email addresses of the organizers, with a brief statement (2-5 sentences) of their research interests, areas of expertise, and experience in organizing workshops and related events. 
  A list of Program Committee members, with an indication of which members have already agreed. Organizers should do their best to estimate the number of submissions (especially for recurring workshops) in order to (a) ensure a sufficient number of reviewers so that each paper receives 3 reviews, and (b) anticipate that no one is committed to reviewing more than 3 papers. This practice is likely to ensure on-time and thoughtful reviews. 
  An indication whether the workshop will consider papers submitted through ACL Rolling Review (ARR); use OpenReview as a platform (both to take papers from ARR and for their own review); or whether the workshop will only use START as a platform, and will not use ARR. In making this choice, please pay careful attention to the ARR deadlines and conference notifications. 
  References 
  All workshop organizers will additionally be required to agree to the policy on non-compliant ACL workshops  , a failure for any of the workshop organizers to agree to this policy will result in a desk rejection of the workshop proposal.  
 Submission is electronic at the following link: https://softconf.com/p/acl-workshops2025/   
 The workshop proposals will be evaluated according to their originality and impact, and the quality of the organizing team and Programme Committee.  
 Diversity and Inclusion  
 The proposals should describe the ways in which the workshop will support diversity in NLP. We suggest organizers consider the following points, while developing the proposal:  
 Contribution to academic diversity: The proposals could explain how the subject matter of the workshop will contribute to the diversity of the field, e.g. use of multilingual data, indications of how the described methods scale up to various languages or domains, accessibility of resources, supporting underrepresented communities of NLP and so on. 
  Diversifying representation: Following the | WiNLP | initiative, we recognize the current problems of demographic imbalance in the field. Therefore, we particularly encourage submissions including members of under-represented groups in computational linguistics. The proposals should describe how their selection of invited speakers, panelists, organizers, and program committee promotes diverse representation (for example, considering underrepresented demographics based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, and so on). We also suggest including speakers and panelists, who have not appeared as a keynote speaker or panelist in recent conferences. 
  Diversifying participation: The proposals could describe how the call-for-papers and outreach will encourage people from marginalized groups to attend and submit to the workshop. Some examples include providing mentoring, subsidies, coordinating with affinity groups, diversifying the selection of papers and so on.

 The organizers of the accepted proposals will be responsible for publicizing and running the workshop, including reviewing submissions, producing the camera-ready workshop proceedings, organizing the meeting days, and playing their part to ensure that all participants are aware of ACL’s anti-harassment policy. It is crucial that organizers commit to all deadlines. In particular, failure to produce the camera-ready proceedings on time will lead to the exclusion of the workshop from the unified proceedings and author indexes. Workshop organizers cannot accept submissions for publication that will be (or have been) published  
 elsewhere, although they are free to set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. However, it is worth noting that workshops may also accept non-archival submissions, such as findings papers, for presentation, which are allowed in this case. Since the conferences will occur at different times, the timelines for the submission and reviewing of workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be different for each conference. Suggested timelines for each of the conferences are given below. The workshop organizers are free to deviate from the proposed schedule for all dates that are not marked as inflexible, though changes should be made in consultation with the relevant workshop chairs.  
 In submitting a proposal, workshop chairs will be asked to agree to the workshop non-compliance policy  . All workshops must agree to this policy, which states that egregious  cases of not living up to the responsibilities of running a workshop will be penalized by a 1-year ban on the organizers from submitting another workshop proposal. Workshop proposals for which all authors do not agree to this policy will be desk rejected.  
 The ACL has a set of policies on workshops. You can find the ACL’s general policies on workshops, the financial policy for workshops, and the financial policy for SIG workshops in the Conference Handbook  .

  Contact Information 

 NAACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. NAACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.  
 As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2024 October cycle using the following link:  
 https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2024/October   
 Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2024 October cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to NAACL using the following link:  
 https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Conference   
 Note that this link will be available only two weeks before the commitment deadline.  
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload  
 As our pace of research continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here  . As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.  
 Submission Topic  
 NAACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:  
 Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics 
  Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
  Discourse and Pragmatics 
  Efficient/Low-resource Methods for NLP 
  Ethics, Bias, and Fairness 
  Generation 
  Human-centered NLP 
  Information Extraction 
  Information Retrieval and Text Mining 
  Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP 
  Language Modeling 
  Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics 
  Machine Learning for NLP 
  Machine Translation 
  Multilinguality and Language Diversity 
  Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond 
  Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation

  Summarization 
  Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing / ML 
  NLP Applications 
  Special Theme: NLP in a Multicultural World 
  NAACL 2025 Theme Track: NLP in a Multicultural World  
 Current NLP tools and models, especially LLMs, require vast amounts of data to train. However, the data used often favors only a handful of over-represented languages, and even for these majoritarian languages only some of the existing geographical or cultural varieties are considered, leaving a large tail of under-represented languages, varieties, and cultures that have had considerably less attention from the NLP community. In this year’s theme track we would like to focus on work providing support to the vibrant multicultural world we live in. We welcome papers in the following non-exhaustive list of topics:  
 Cultural localization of language models. 
  New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures. 
  Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages. 
  Analysis of cultural biases in language models. 
  Historical considerations and diachronic analysis. 
  Two Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to NAACL  
 NAACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review  (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review  platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., NAACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
  NAACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with the other *ACL 2025 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference, or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  
 Important Dates for NAACL 2025  
 15 Oct 2024: Submission deadline for ARR 2024 October 
  30 Oct 2024 - 18 Nov 2024: Reviewing period for ARR 2024 October 
  11 Nov 2024: Notification of desk rejection for submissions to ARR 2024 October that violate policy

  Note:  All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).  
 Following the ACL and ARR policies  , there is no anonymity period requirement.   
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., NAACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected NAACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to NAACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than NAACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to NAACL 2025.

 Presentation at the Conference  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline of NAACL 2025 may be subject to desk rejection.  
 Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.
