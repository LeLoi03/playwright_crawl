 The International Conference on Research Infrastructures (ICRI 2024) has released its full program with 90 global experts speaking across more than 20 sessions from 3 to 5 December 2024.  
  
 ICRI 2024 will showcase the world’s best strategies and networks for efficient, effective and accessible infrastructure, and explore how it can help confront global challenges, improve collaboration, and deliver societal impact.  
  
 Australia’s national science agency, CSIRO, is hosting ICRI 2024 in cooperation with the European Commission and the Australian Department of Education.  
 “By providing an opportunity for the ongoing exchange of information, ideas and talent it will increase the capacity of research infrastructures to respond to, and cooperate on, complex and global societal and research challenges,” Professor Elanor Huntington, CSIRO’s Digital, National Facilities and Collections Executive Director, said.  
  
 Sessions will cover pandemic preparedness, how research infrastructure can address climate change over the next 30 years, the global energy transition, and developing new crops and management systems suited to changing climates.  
  
 For the first time ICRI will cover Indigenous knowledge.  
 Maori, Lakota, Sami, and Australian First Nations peoples will discuss how to build ethical, meaningful and respectful collaborations with local and Indigenous communities.  
 “Attendees will gain practical insights into fostering equitable and impactful research infrastructure alongside Indigenous communities,” Professor Huntington said.  
  
 “Australia is hosting ICRI 2024 to ensure the greatest possible attendance from our Southeast Asia and Pacific neighbours, to increase their ability to network and collaborate with the global research infrastructure community,” said Claire Sainsbury, Assistant Secretary of Research Policy and Programs at the Australian Department of Education.  
 “It is also a chance to showcase Australian research infrastructure and the globally recognised National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) model that underpins so much of it”.  
  
 The role and future uses of large-scale facilities such as synchrotrons, lasers, neutron sources, electron microscopy, quantum and high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, and astronomy will be highlighted.  
  
 ICRI 2024 will also consider the future RI workforce, with a focus on developing the next generation of leaders, and hear from global Early Career Scientists as they pitch their visionary ideas for the research infrastructures the world will need by 2050.  
  
 ICRI 2024 will be a hybrid event, held both in person and online, to ensure the greatest possible level of global involvement and benefit from the sessions />

 Special  Session on:   AIGC and E-commerce Platforms Governance      
      
 Introduction:      
 The extensive application of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) across e-commerce platforms brings significant conveniences to both consumers and merchants. However, it also generates a series of challenges. For instance, some consumers exhibit resistance and stereotypical biases towards AIGC. Additionally, AIGC itself faces issues such as low-quality information. This session, focusing from the viewpoint of e-commerce platforms, investigates the mechanisms by which consumers on e-commerce platforms develop attitudes towards various forms of AIGC. The objective is to aid platforms in optimizing their use of AIGC and refining their governance strategies. Key topics include but are not limited to: consumer attitudes and perceptions towards AIGC on e-commerce platforms, consumer online engagement based on AIGC, detection of misinformation in AIGC, the impact of platform AIGC applications strategies on consumer experiences, and platform governance strategies for AIGC.

 Session Title   :   AIGC in E-Commerce Marketing      
 Session Description   :    Explore how AIGC is reshaping e-commerce marketing by transforming content creation, distribution models, and customer engagement. This session focuses on the following key areas:    
 (1) Brand Storytelling: Analyze how AIGC-generated personalized content helps brands create unique identities and forge emotional connections with consumers.    
 (2) Consumer Social Interactions: Examine the role of AIGC in enhancing social media advertising, user-generated content interactions, and community building.    
 (3) Dynamic Marketing: Investigate how AIGC enables rapid responses to market demands, including real-time personalized recommendations, dynamic pricing, and multi-channel marketing.    
 (4) Optimizing Marketing Process Efficiency: Highlight how AIGC-driven content automation and data analytics improve decision-making efficiency, reduce marketing costs, and optimize resource allocation.    
 This session provides insights into how AIGC drives innovation in e-commerce marketing strategies and transforms the customer experience.

  Welcome to ICECCS 2025  
 Driven by advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed systems, autonomous intelligent systems, and cyber-physical systems, complex computer systems increasingly shape every aspect of human life, from manufacturing and communications to healthcare, defense, transportation, and energy, the demand for advanced methodologies and tools is growing. These systems are often distributed across heterogeneous networks, leveraging vast amounts of data alongside emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques. Recent trends, including the rise of large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence, have introduced additional challenges and opportunities in the engineering of such systems. The complexity of modern systems arises from dynamic operating environments, diverse functional requirements, and conflicting needs such as performance, scalability, security, dependability, and adaptability. These challenges are compounded by factors like real-time behavior, fault tolerance, robustness, and long-term sustainability, making the engineering of these systems a multidisciplinary effort.  
 The 29th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2025) is a well-established event that has been held around the world for over 29 years. It aims to bring together experts from industry, academia, and government to exchange ideas on the engineering of intricate systems.

The ultimate goal is to build a rich and comprehensive conference program that can fit the interests and needs of different classes of attendees: professionals, researchers, managers, and students. A program goal is to organize several sessions that include both academic and industrial papers on a given topic and culminate panels to discuss relationships between industrial and academic research.  
  
  Submission and Publication   
 ICECCS 2025 accepts both full papers and short papers.  
 Full papers are divided into two categories: Technical Papers and Experience Reports. The papers submitted to both categories will be reviewed by the program committee members, and papers accepted in either category will be published in the conference proceedings. Technical papers should describe original research, and experience reports should present practical projects carried out in the industry, and reflect on the lessons learnt from them. 
  Short paper submissions describe early-stage, ongoing or PhD research. All short papers will be reviewed by the program committee members, and accepted short papers will be published in the conference proceedings. 
  Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference.  
 Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style of LNCS format. Full papers should not exceed 20 papers (including bibliography, etc.), and short papers should not exceed 11 pages (including bibliography, etc.). All submissions should be in PDF format. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately without review. Please prepare your manuscripts in accordance with the Springer LNCS guidelines: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   
 We invite all prospective authors to submit their manuscripts via the ICECCS 2025 portal, hosted by the EasyChair conference management system: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iceccs2025  .

 Calls for Submissions  
 1. Journal and Conference Tracks  
 Full papers are the main media for presenting high impact, mature research with original new results. Submissions should describe novel unpublished work addressing one or more of the research topics listed. As a new feature this year, authors can submit their papers to either the journal track or the conference track.  
 The Journal track will publish accepted papers in a special issue of the Elsevier’s Journal of Entertainment Computing (ENTCOM). Accepted papers will be presented at the conference, and published in the journal at a later date. Papers presented for the journal track should follow the submission and publication process of ENTCOM. Papers submitted to the journal could be either conditionally accepted in the journal track, conditionally accepted after resubmission in the conference track, or rejected. Note that the deadline for the conference track will be after the journal track notification. Papers accepted to this track will be published in the special issue only if at least one author registers and presents their work at the conference.  
 Accepted conference papers will be published in a book form in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Papers submitted to the conference track could be either conditionally accepted in the conference track, conditionally accepted in the Works in Progress track, or rejected. Accepted papers will be scheduled for long presentations and discussions at the conference. Papers accepted to this track will be published in LNCS, only if at least one author registers and presents their work at the conference.  
 Paper length should reflect the contribution and maturity of the submission and reviewers from the program committee will be instructed to judge the contribution of a paper relative to its length. For example, typical contributions presenting significant research advances/results should not exceed 12 pages in length excluding references.  
 In addition, videos are encouraged and can be included in the paper or as Electronic Supplementary Material. See the guidelines for the journal or the conference track for more details.  
 2 Works in Progress  
 Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will be included into the official Springer LNCS proceedings and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference.  
 WiP submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length, excluding references, in Springer LNCS format. Submissions with exceeding length relative to their contribution can be rejected. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs.

 4 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works  
 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works are interactive demonstrations, installations, and games that show early implementations of novel, interesting, and important entertainment computing concepts, systems, installations, or games, or can serve to showcase results not previously described in the research literature.  
 Both research and industry are encouraged to send in and showcase demonstrators of novel approaches to entertainment. We particularly encourage demonstrations with which attendees can interact and play.  
 An Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works submission is a shorter submission describing a novel approach to entertainment computing concepts. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and should be composed of a document with 4-5 pages using Springer LNCS format, and structured as follows:  
 Up to four pages for an extended abstract 
  A final page that contains the link to an online video, a list of technical requirements (including electrical and connectivity needs), and physical space requirements (including display and footprint needs) 
  Successful submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. Submissions should follow the underlying extended abstract structure and must be clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. The extended abstract must contain the following sections: abstract and keywords, introduction, methodology, findings, conclusion, and references. Sections can be named differently, and subsections can be included.

 Calls for Submissions  
 1. Journal and Conference Tracks  
 Full papers are the main media for presenting high impact, mature research with original new results. Submissions should describe novel unpublished work addressing one or more of the research topics listed. As a new feature this year, authors can submit their papers to either the journal track or the conference track.  
 The Journal track will publish accepted papers in a special issue of the Elsevier’s Journal of Entertainment Computing (ENTCOM). Accepted papers will be presented at the conference, and published in the journal at a later date. Papers presented for the journal track should follow the submission and publication process of ENTCOM. Papers submitted to the journal could be either conditionally accepted in the journal track, conditionally accepted after resubmission in the conference track, or rejected. Note that the deadline for the conference track will be after the journal track notification. Papers accepted to this track will be published in the special issue only if at least one author registers and presents their work at the conference.  
 Accepted conference papers will be published in a book form in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Papers submitted to the conference track could be either conditionally accepted in the conference track, conditionally accepted in the Works in Progress track, or rejected. Accepted papers will be scheduled for long presentations and discussions at the conference. Papers accepted to this track will be published in LNCS, only if at least one author registers and presents their work at the conference.  
 Paper length should reflect the contribution and maturity of the submission and reviewers from the program committee will be instructed to judge the contribution of a paper relative to its length. For example, typical contributions presenting significant research advances/results should not exceed 12 pages in length excluding references.  
 In addition, videos are encouraged and can be included in the paper or as Electronic Supplementary Material. See the guidelines for the journal or the conference track for more details.  
 2 Works in Progress  
 Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will be included into the official Springer LNCS proceedings and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference.  
 WiP submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length, excluding references, in Springer LNCS format. Submissions with exceeding length relative to their contribution can be rejected. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs.  
 3 Workshops and Tutorials  
 We invite proposals for workshops and tutorials that will be held at IFIP-ICEC 2025.  
 3.1 Workshops  
 We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing and serious games research (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends in these areas. Workshop proposals must include the following information:  
 Workshop or tutorial title and short abstract (max. 50 words) 
  Workshop summary, short review of state of the art, motivation and goals 
  Workshop format (an activity plan and its rationale towards the goals) 
  Workshop format for participant enrollment (e.g., position papers, prior expression of interest, or other applicable requirements for planning and organization) 
  Profile of participants (and estimated number of participants) 
  Contact of the organizers (name, affiliation, address, phone#, email) 
  Short but relevant bio information of the organizers 
  Expected workshop outcomes (proceedings, special issue of journals, project proposals, etc.) 
  Proposed workshop due dates (take into consideration conference schedules); workshops can be scheduled for either half a day (4h) or a full day (8h) 
  Workshops are open to all IFIP-ICEC attendees at no additional cost, even if they do not submit any contribution to the workshops. 
  Submissions need to adhere to the stated workshop proposal deadline. Additionally, to be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of workshop proposals may also submit a 6-page (maximum, excluding references) paper in the Springer LNCS format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular workshop proposals will not be included in the proceedings.  
 3.2 Tutorials  
 We invite proposals for tutorials that will be held in conjunction with ICEC 2025. We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends. Tutorial proposals should be two pages in length and must include the following information:  
 Contact information (name, affiliation, address, phone number and email) of the tutorial organizer(s) 
  Relevant CV information of the tutorial leader(s) 
  Tutorial title 
  Tutorial objective 
  Background/relevance of tutorial topic 
  Intended duration (3h or 6h) 
  Brief summary of the content 
  To be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of tutorial proposals may also submit a 6-page (maximum) paper in the Springer LNCS format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular tutorial proposals will not be included in the proceedings.  
 4 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works  
 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works are interactive demonstrations, installations, and games that show early implementations of novel, interesting, and important entertainment computing concepts, systems, installations, or games, or can serve to showcase results not previously described in the research literature.  
 Both research and industry are encouraged to send in and showcase demonstrators of novel approaches to entertainment. We particularly encourage demonstrations with which attendees can interact and play.  
 An Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works submission is a shorter submission describing a novel approach to entertainment computing concepts. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and should be composed of a document with 4-5 pages using Springer LNCS format, and structured as follows:  
 Up to four pages for an extended abstract 
  A final page that contains the link to an online video, a list of technical requirements (including electrical and connectivity needs), and physical space requirements (including display and footprint needs) 
  Successful submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. Submissions should follow the underlying extended abstract structure and must be clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. The extended abstract must contain the following sections: abstract and keywords, introduction, methodology, findings, conclusion, and references. Sections can be named differently, and subsections can be included.

 Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will be included into the official Springer LNCS proceedings and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference.  
 WiP submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length, excluding references, in Springer LNCS format. Submissions with exceeding length relative to their contribution can be rejected. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs.  
 3 Workshops and Tutorials  
 We invite proposals for workshops and tutorials that will be held at IFIP-ICEC 2025.  
 3.1 Workshops  
 We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing and serious games research (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends in these areas.

  Profile of participants (and estimated number of participants) 
  Contact of the organizers (name, affiliation, address, phone#, email) 
  Short but relevant bio information of the organizers 
  Expected workshop outcomes (proceedings, special issue of journals, project proposals, etc.) 
  Proposed workshop due dates (take into consideration conference schedules); workshops can be scheduled for either half a day (4h) or a full day (8h) 
  Workshops are open to all IFIP-ICEC attendees at no additional cost, even if they do not submit any contribution to the workshops. 
  Submissions need to adhere to the stated workshop proposal deadline. Additionally, to be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of workshop proposals may also submit a 6-page (maximum, excluding references) paper in the Springer LNCS format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular workshop proposals will not be included in the proceedings.  
 3.2 Tutorials  
 We invite proposals for tutorials that will be held in conjunction with ICEC 2025. We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends. Tutorial proposals should be two pages in length and must include the following information:  
 Contact information (name, affiliation, address, phone number and email) of the tutorial organizer(s) 
  Relevant CV information of the tutorial leader(s) 
  Tutorial title 
  Tutorial objective 
  Background/relevance of tutorial topic 
  Intended duration (3h or 6h) 
  Brief summary of the content 
  To be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of tutorial proposals may also submit a 6-page (maximum) paper in the Springer LNCS format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular tutorial proposals will not be included in the proceedings.  
 4 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works  
 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works are interactive demonstrations, installations, and games that show early implementations of novel, interesting, and important entertainment computing concepts, systems, installations, or games, or can serve to showcase results not previously described in the research literature.  
 Both research and industry are encouraged to send in and showcase demonstrators of novel approaches to entertainment. We particularly encourage demonstrations with which attendees can interact and play.  
 An Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works submission is a shorter submission describing a novel approach to entertainment computing concepts. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and should be composed of a document with 4-5 pages using Springer LNCS format, and structured as follows:  
 Up to four pages for an extended abstract 
  A final page that contains the link to an online video, a list of technical requirements (including electrical and connectivity needs), and physical space requirements (including display and footprint needs) 
  Successful submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. Submissions should follow the underlying extended abstract structure and must be clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. The extended abstract must contain the following sections: abstract and keywords, introduction, methodology, findings, conclusion, and references. Sections can be named differently, and subsections can be included.

  Student Game and Interactive Entertainment Competition  
 All students up to and including PhD candidate level are eligible to send in their game or interactive entertainment installation, as long as the demonstrator is fully experiential, and the demonstrator is part of a research endeavor. This could be a platform to perform research with, a research through design contribution, or a design exemplar of something that advances the state of the art, but the paper detailing the game or interactive entertainment installation should make clear what the development of it may add to our knowledge of games and entertainment.  
   
 Submission Deadline:  May 5th  New Deadline: July 28th   - Click here for more information.   

  Doctoral Consortium  
 The Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished researchers in entertainment computing and/or serious games. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply for this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The strongest candidates will be those who have a clear idea and an area, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes. Also, as well as stating how you will gain from acceptance, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium..  
   
 Submission Deadline: August 15th  - Click here for more information.   

  Workshops and Tutorials Proposals  
 We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing and serious games research (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends in these areas.

  ICER Conference 

 ICER Conference  
 Computing education, as a research discipline, is the study of how people come to understand computational processes and devices, and how to improve that understanding. As computation becomes ubiquitous in our world, understanding of computing in order to design, structure maintain, and utilize these technologies becomes increasingly important both for the technology professional, but also for the technologically literate citizen. The research study of how the understanding of computation develops, and how to improve that understanding, is critically important for the technology-dependent societies in which we live.  
 The International Computing Education Research (ICER) conference aims at gathering high-quality contributions to the computing education research discipline. It has been held annually since 2005 at sites around the world, and recently has been attracting an audience of over 100 computing education researchers.

 28th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2024)  
 (Collocated with ICSR 2024  )   
   
 19-21 June,  2024     
 Limassol, Cyprus      

 The registration system is now OPEN    

 WELCOME   

 Recent years have witnessed a rapidly rising emphasis on the design, implementation and management of complex computer systems which are present in every aspect of human activities, such as manufacturing, communications, defence, transportation, aerospace, hazardous environments, energy, and healthcare. These complex systems are frequently distributed over heterogeneous networks and process a large amount of data, leveraging emerging artificial intelligence (AI), large language models, and machine learning techniques. Complexity arises from many factors, including the dynamic environment and the scenarios these systems operate in, demanding and sometimes conflicting requirements in functionality, efficiency, scalability, security, dependability and adaptability, data heterogeneity, as well as the wide range of development methodologies, programming languages and implementation details. Performance, real-time behaviour, fault tolerance, robustness, security, adaptability, development time and cost, and long life concerns are some of the key issues arising in the development of such systems.   
 The International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS) is a well-established event that has been held around the world for over 25 years. The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, and government experts from a variety of application domains and software disciplines, to discuss how the disciplines’ problems and solution techniques interact within the whole system. Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer experts are all welcome. The scope of the conference includes long-term research issues, near-term requirements and challenges, established complex systems, emerging promising tools, and retrospective and prospective reflections of research and development into complex systems   
 ICECCS is a B-ranked  international conference by the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE)  2023 ranking.   

 ICECCS 2024 will be collocated with ICSR 2024   .

 To facilitate the dissemination of high-quality research presented at ICECCS 2024, selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their accepted conference papers to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM). Authors of these selected papers are kindly requested to submit their extended manuscripts within six months following their conference presentation. Upon the authors’ acceptance of this invitation, TOSEM will provide comprehensive instructions and requirements for the submission and review process. TOSEM will conduct its rigorous review process and make final decisions on acceptance.  
 Submission and Publication   
 Full papers are divided into two categories: Technical Papers and Experience Reports. The papers submitted to both categories will be reviewed by the program committee members, and papers accepted in either category will be published in the conference proceedings. Technical papers should describe original research, and experience reports should present practical projects carried out in the industry, and reflect on the lessons learnt from them.   
 Short paper submissions describe early-stage, ongoing or PhD research. All short papers will be reviewed by the program committee members, and accepted short papers will be published in the conference proceedings.   
 Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).  
 Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style of LNCS format. Full papers should not exceed 20 papers (including bibliography, etc.), and short papers should not exceed 11 pages (including bibliography, etc.). All submissions should be in PDF format. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately without review.  
 Please prepare your manuscripts in accordance with the Springer LNCS guidelines:  
 https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   
 We invite all prospective authors to submit their manuscripts via the ICECCS 2024 portal, hosted by the EasyChair conference management system.

 View track page for all details   
 Aims and Scope   
 The 20th annual ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER) aims to gather high-quality contributions to the Computing Education Research discipline. The “Research Papers” track invites submissions describing original research results related to any aspect of teaching and learning computing, from introductory through advanced material. Submissions are welcome from across the research methods used in Computing Education Research and related fields. Each contribution will be assessed based on:  
 the appropriateness and soundness of its methods 
  its relevance to teaching or learning computing, and 
  the depth of its contribution to the community’s understanding of the question at hand. 
  Research areas of particular interest include:

 Call for Papers  
  
 Aims and Scope   
 The 20th annual ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER) aims to gather high-quality contributions to the Computing Education Research discipline. The “Research Papers” track invites submissions describing original research results related to any aspect of teaching and learning computing, from introductory through advanced material. Submissions are welcome from across the research methods used in Computing Education Research and related fields. Each contribution will be assessed based on:  
 the appropriateness and soundness of its methods 
  its relevance to teaching or learning computing, and 
  the depth of its contribution to the community’s understanding of the question at hand. 
  Research areas of particular interest include:  
 design-based research, learner-centered design, and evaluation of educational technology supporting computing knowledge or skills development, 
  discipline based education research (DBER) about computing, computer science, and related disciplines, 
  informal learning experiences related to programming and software development (all ages), ranging from after-school programs for children, to end-user development communities, to workplace training of computing professionals, 
  learnability of programming languages and tools for learning programming and computing concepts, 
  learning analytics and educational data mining in computing education contexts, 
  learning sciences work in the computing content domain, 
  measurement instrument development and validation (e.g., concept inventories, attitudes scales, etc) for use in computing disciplines, 
  pedagogical environments fostering computational thinking, 
  psychology of programming, 
  rigorous replication of empirical work, relevant to computing education, to compare with or extend previous empirical research results, 
  professional development for computing educators at all levels. 
  While this above list is non-exclusive, authors are also invited to consider the call for papers for the “Lightning Talks & Posters” and “Work-in-Progress” tracks if in doubt about the suitability of their work for this track.  
 Please see the Submission Instructions  for details on how to prepare your submission. It includes links to the relevant ACM policies including the ACM Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  as well as the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.   
 All questions about this call should go to the ICER 2024 program committee chairs at pc-chairs@icer.acm.org  .

 Submission Instructions  
   
 Submission Process   
 Submit at the ICER 2024 HotCRP site  .  
 When you submit the abstract or full version ready for review, you need to perform the following actions:  
 Check the checkbox “ready for review” at the bottom of the submission form. (Otherwise it will be marked as a draft). 
  Check the checkbox “I have read and understood the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  ”. Note: “Where such research is conducted in countries where no such local governing laws and regulations related to human participant and subject research exist, Authors must at a bare minimum be prepared to show compliance with the above detailed principles.” 
  Check the checkbox “I have read and understood the ACM Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  ; in particular, no version of this work is under submission elsewhere.”. Make sure to disclose possible overlap with your own previous work (“redundant publication”) to the ICER Program Committee co-chairs  . 
  Check the checkbox “I have read and understood the ICER Anonymization Policy” (see below). 
  ICER Anonymization Policy   
 ICER research paper submissions will be reviewed using a double-anonymous process: the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers and the reviewers do not know the identity of the authors. To ensure this:  
 Avoid titles that indicate a clearly identifiable research project. 
  Remove author names and affiliations. (If you are using LaTeX, you can start your document declaration with \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart}  to easily anonymize these. 
  Avoid referring to yourself when citing your own work. 
  Redact (just for review) portions of positionality statements that would identify you within the community (perhaps due to demographics shared by few others). 
  Avoid references to your affiliation. For example, rather than referring to your actual university, you might write “A Large Metropolitan University (ALMU)” rather than “Auckland University of Technology (AUT)”. 
  Redact any other identifying information such as contributors, course numbers, IRB names and numbers, grant titles and numbers, from the main text and the acknowledgements. 
  Omit author details from the PDF you generate, such as author name or the name of the source document. These are often automatically inserted into exported PDFs, so be sure to check your PDF before submission. 
  Do not simply cover identifying details with a black box, as the text can easily be seen from under the box by dragging the cursor over it, and will still be read by screen readers.  
 Work that is not sufficiently anonymized will be desk-rejected by the PC chairs without offering an option to redact and resubmit.   
 Authoring Guidelines   
 The ICER conference maintains an evolving author guide  , full of recommendations about scope, statistics, qualitative methods, theory, and other concerns that may arise when drafting your submission. These guidelines are a ground truth for reviewers; study them closely as you plan your research and prepare your submission.  
 Conflict of Interests   
 The SIGCSE Conflict of Interest policy  applies to all submissions. You can review how conflicts will be managed by consulting our reviewer training  , which details our review process.  
 Submission Format and Publication Workflow   
 Papers submitted to the research track of ICER 2023 have to be prepared according to the ACM TAPS workflow system  . Read this page carefully to understand the new workflow.  
 Starting in 2021, ICER switched to a publication format (called TAPS) that separates content from presentation in support of accessibility. This means that the submission format and the publication format differ. For submission, we standardize on a single-column presentation.  
 The | submission | template is either the single column Word Submission Template or the single column LaTeX (using the “manuscript,review,anonymous” style available in template, which you can see an example of in the | sample-manuscript.tex | example in the LaTeX master template samples). Reviewers will review in this single column format. You can download these templates on the | ACM Master Article Templates | page 
  The | publication | template is either the single column Word Submission Template or LaTeX template using “sigconf” style in acmart. You can download the templates on the | ACM TAPS workflow page | page, where you can also see example papers using the TAPS-compatible Word and LaTeX templates. If your paper is accepted, you will use the TAPS system to generate your final publication outputs. This will involve more than just submitting a PDF, requiring you to instead submit your Word or LaTeX source files and fix any errors in your source before the final version deadline listed above. The final published versions will be the ACM two-column conference PDF format (as well as XML, HTML, and ePub formats in the future). 
  For LaTeX users, be aware that there is a list of approved LaTeX packages  for use with ACM TAPS. Not all packages are allowed.  
 This separation of submission and publication format results in several benefits:  
 Improved quality of paper metadata, improving ACM Digital Library search. 
  Multiple paper output formats, including PDFs, responsive HTML5, XML, and ePub. 
  Improved accessibility of paper content for people with disabilities. 
  Streamlined publication timelines. 
  Submission Length   
 Authors may submit papers up to 11,000 words in length, excluding acknowledgements, references, figures, but including all other text, including tables. To clarify, “all other text” does include appendices. ICER papers must be self-contained in the sense that reviewers can assess the contribution without referring to any external material. Appendices in the submitted PDF are considered to be part of the main text and thus are subject to the word count. If authors want to provide additional material, e.g., codebooks, they must do so in an anonymized way via an external web resource of their choice; reviewers will neither be required nor asked, however, to consult such resources when assessing a paper’s contribution. The PC chairs will use the following procedures for counting words for TAPS approved formats:  
 For papers written in the Microsoft Word template, Word’s built-in word-count mechanism will be used, selecting all text except acknowledgements and references. 
  For papers written in the LaTeX template, the document will be converted to plain text using the “ExtractText” functionality of the Apache pdfbox suite (see | here | ) and then post processed with a standard command-line word count tool (“wc -w”, to be precise). Line numbers added by the “review” class option for LaTeX will be removed prior to counting by using “grep -v -E ‘^[0-9]+$’” (thanks to N. Brown for this). | We acknowledge that many authors may want to use Overleaf to avoid dealing with command-line tools and, consequently, may be less enthusiastic about using another command-line tool for assessing the word count. As it is configured by default, Overleaf does not count text in tables, captions, and math formula and, thus, is very likely to significantly underestimate the number obtained through the tool described above. To obtain a more realistic word count during the writing of the manuscript, authors need to take these additional steps: | Add the following lines at the very beginning of your Overleaf LaTeX document: | %TC:macro \cite [option:text,text] %TC:macro \citep [option:text,text] %TC:macro \citet [option:text,text] %TC:envir table 0 1 %TC:envir table* 0 1 %TC:envir tabular [ignore] word %TC:envir displaymath 0 word %TC:envir math 0 word %TC:envir comment 0 0 | Make sure to write math formulae delimited by | \begin{math} \end{math} | for in-line math and | \begin{displaymath} \end{displaymath} | for equations. Do not use dollar signs or | \[ \] | ; these will result in Overleaf not counting math tokens (unlike Word and pdfbox) and thus underestimate your word count. 
  The above flags will ensure that in-text citations, tables, and math formulae will be counted but that comments will be ignored. 
  The above flags do not cover more advanced LaTeX environments, so if authors use such environments, they should interpret the Overleaf word count with care (then again, if authors know how to work with such environments it is very reasonable to assume that they also know how to work with command-line tools such as pdfbox). 
  Authors relying on Overleaf word count should be advised that the submission chairs will not have access to the source files and cannot re-run or verify any counting mechanism done by the submitting authors. To provide a fair treatment across all submission types, only the approved tools mentioned above will be used for word count. That said, submission chairs will operate under a | bona fide | assumption when it comes to extreme borderline cases. 
  Papers in either format may not use figures to render text in ways that work around the word count limit; papers abusing figures in this way will be desk-rejected. 
  A paper under the word count limit with either of the above approved tools is acceptable. The submissions chairs will evaluate each submission using the procedures above, notify the PC chairs of papers exceeding the limit, and desk-reject any papers that do.  
 We expect papers to vary in word count. Abstracts may vary in length, less than 300 words is a good guideline for conciseness. Submission length should be commensurate with its contributions; we expect most papers to be less than 9,000 words according to the rules above, though some may use up to the limit in order to convey details authors deem necessary to evaluate the work. Papers may be judged as too long if they are repetitive, verbose, violate formatting rules, or use figures to save on word count. Papers may be judged as too short if they omit critical details or ignore relevant prior work. See the reviewer training  for more on how reviewers will be instructed to assess conciseness.  
 All of the procedures above, and the TAPS workflow, will likely undergo continued iteration in partnership with ACM, the ICER Steering Committee, and the SIGCSE board. Notify the chairs of questions, edge cases, and other concerns to help improve this new workflow.  
 Acceptance and Conditional Acceptance   
 All papers recommended for acceptance after the Senior PC meetings are either accepted or conditionally accepted. For accepted papers, there is no resubmission required other than the final camera-ready version. For conditionally-accepted papers, meta-reviews will indicate one or more minor revisions that are necessary for final acceptance; authors are responsible for submitting these revisions to HotCRP prior to the “Conditional Accept revisions due” deadline in the Call for Papers. The Senior PC and Program Chairs will review the final revisions; if they are acceptable, the paper will be officially accepted, and authors will have one week to submit an approved camera-ready version to TAPS for publication. If the Senior PC and Program Chairs judge that the request for revisions were not suitably addressed, the paper will be rejected.  
 Because the turnaround time for conditional acceptance is only one week, requested revisions will necessarily be minor: they may include presentation issues or requests for added clarity or details helpful for future readers of the archived paper. New results, new methodological details that change the interpretation of the results, or other substantially new content will neither be asked for nor allowed to be added.  
 Kudos   
 After a paper has been accepted and uploaded into the ACM Digital Library, authors will receive an invitation from Kudos to create an account and add plain-language text into Kudos on its platform. The Kudos “Shareable PDF” integration with ACM will then allow an author to generate a PDF to upload to websites, such as author homepages, institutional repositories, and preprint services, such as ArXiv. This PDF contains the author’s plain-text summary of the paper as well as a link to the full-text version of an article in the ACM Digital Library, adding to the DL download and citation counts there, as well as adding views from other platforms to the author’s Kudos dashboard.  
 Using Kudos is entirely optional. Authors may also use the other ACM copyright options  to share their work (retaining copyright, paying for open access, etc.).  
 ACM Publications Policy   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
   
 Author Guidelines  
   
 If you are reading this page, you are probably considering submitting to ICER. Congratulations! We are excited to review your work. Whether your research is just starting or nearly finished, this guide is intended to help authors meet the expectations of the computing education research community. It reflects a community-wide perspective on what constitutes rigorous research on the teaching and learning of computing.  
 Read on for our community’s current guidelines, and if you like, read our reviewer guidelines  to understand our review process and review criteria.  
 What’s in scope at ICER?   
 ICER’s goal is to be an inclusive conference, both with respect to epistemology (how we know we know things) and with respect to phenomena (who is learning and in what context). Therefore, any research related to the teaching and learning of computing is in scope, using any definition of computing, and using any methods. We particularly encourage work that goes beyond the community’s past focus on introductory programming courses in post-secondary education: such as work on primary and secondary education, work on more advanced computing concepts, informal learning in any setting or learning amongst adults. (However, note that simply using computing technology to perform research in an educational setting is not in itself enough, the focus must be on the teaching or learning of computing topics.) If you have not seen a particular topic published on a topic at ICER, or you have not seen a particular method be used, that is okay. We value new topics, new methods, new perspectives, and new ideas, just as much as more broadly accepted ones.  
 That said, under the current review process, we cannot promise that we have recruited all the necessary expertise to our program committee to fairly review your work. Check who is on the program committee this year, and if you do not see a lot of expertise on your methods or phenomena, make sure your submission spends a bit of extra time explaining theories or methods that reviewers are unlikely to know. If you have any questions regarding this, email the program chairs ( pc-chairs@icer.acm.org  ).  
 Note that we used the word “research” above. Research is hard to define, but we can say that ICER is not a place to submit practical descriptions of courses, curriculum, or instruction materials you want to share. If you’re looking to share your experiences at a conference, consider submitting to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium’s Experience Report or Position and Curricula Initiatives tracks. Research, in contrast, should meet the criteria presented throughout this document.  
 What makes a good computing education research paper?   
 It’s impossible to anticipate every kind of paper that might be submitted. The current ICER review criteria are listed in the reviewer guidelines  . These will evolve over time as the community grows. There are many other criteria that reviews could discuss in relation to specific types of research contributions, but the criteria listed there are generally inclusive to many epistemologies and contribution types. This includes empirical studies that answer research questions, replicate prior results, or present negative research results as well as other, non-empirical types of research that provide novel or deepened insights into the teaching and learning of computer science content.  
 What prior work should be cited?   
 As with any research work, your submission should cite all significant publications that are relevant to your research questions. With respect to ICER submissions, this may include not only work that has been published in ACM-affiliated venues like ICER, ITiCSE, SIGCSE, Koli Calling, but also the wide range of conferences and journals in the learning sciences, education, educational psychology, HCI, and software engineering. If you are new to research, consider guides on study design  and surveys of prior work like the 2019 Cambridge Handbook of Computing Education Research  , which attempts to survey most of what we know about computing education up to 2018.  
 Papers will be judged on how adequately they are grounded in prior work published across academia. They will also be assessed regarding their accuracy of citing related work: read what you cite closely and ensure the discoveries in published work are supporting your claims; many of the authors of the works you are likely to cite are members of the computing education research community and may be your reviewers. Finally, papers will also be expected to return to prior work in a discussion of a paper’s contributions. All papers should explain how the paper’s contributions advance upon prior work, cause us to reinterpret prior work, or reveal conflicts with prior work.  
 How might theory be used?   
 Different disciplines across academia vary greatly on how they use and develop theory. At the moment, the position of the community is that theory can be a useful tool for framing research, connecting it to prior work, and interpreting findings. Papers can also contribute new theories, or refine them. However, it may also be possible for papers to be atheoretical, discovering interesting new relationships or interventions that cannot yet be explained. All of these uses of theory are appropriate.  
 It is also possible to misuse theory. Sometimes the theories used are too general for a question, where a theory more specific to computing education might be appropriate. In other cases, a theory might be wrongly applied to some phenomena, or a paper might use a theory that has been discredited. Be careful when using theory to understand its history, its body of evidence in support of and against its claims, and its scope of relevance.  
 Note that our community has discussed the role of theory multiple times, and that conversations about how to use theory are evolving:  
 Nelson and Ko (2018)  argued that there are tensions between expectations of theory building and innovative exploration of design ideas, and that our field’s theory building should focus on theories specific to computing education. 
  Malmi et al. (2019)  found that while computing education researchers have widely cited many dozens of unique theoretical ideas about learning, behavior, beliefs, and other phenomena, the use of theory in the field remains somewhat shallow. 
  Kafai et al. (2019)  argued that there are many types of theories, and that we should more deeply leverage their explanatory potential, especially theories about the sociocultural and societal factors at play in computing education, not just the cognitive factors. 
  In addition to using theories when appropriate, ICER encourages the contribution of new theories. There is not a community-level consensus on what constitutes a good theory contribution, but there are examples  you might learn from. Papers proposing a new theoretical model should consider including concrete examples of said model.  
 How should educational contexts be described?   
 If you’re reporting empirical work in a specific education context or set of contexts, it is important to remember that our research community is global, and that education systems across the world are structured differently. This is of particular importance when describing research that took place in primary and secondary schools. Keep in mind that not all readers can be familiar with your educational context. Describe the structure of the educational system. Define terminology related to your education system. Characterize who is teaching, and what prior knowledge and preparation they have. When describing learners, at a minimum, describe their gender, race, ethnicity, age, level in school, and prior knowledge (assuming collecting and publishing this type of data is legal in the context in which the study was conducted, see also the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  ). Include information about other structural factors that might affect how the results are interpreted, including whether courses are required or elective, what incentives students have to enrol in courses, how students in courses vary. For authors in the United States, common terminology to avoid include “elementary school”, “middle school”, “high school”, and “college”, which do not have well-defined meanings elsewhere. Use the more common globally inclusive phrases “primary”, “secondary”, and “post-secondary”. Given the broad spectrum of, e.g., introductory computing courses that run under the umbrella of “CS1”, make sure to provide enough information on the course content rather than relying on an assumed shared understanding.  
 What details should we report about our methods?   
 ICER values a wide range of methods of all kinds, including quantitative, qualitative, design, argumentation, and more. It is critical to describe your methods in detail, both so that reviewers and readers can understand how you arrived at your conclusions, and so they can evaluate the appropriateness of your methods both to the work and, for readers, to their own contexts.  
 Some contributions might benefit from following the Center for Open Science’s recommendations  to ensure replicable, transparent science. These include practices such as:  
 Data should be posted to a trusted repository. 
  Data in that repository is properly cited in the paper. 
  Any code used for analysis is posted to a trusted repository. 
  Results are independently reproduced. 
  Materials used for the study are posted to a trusted repository. 
  Studies and their analysis plans are pre-registered prior to being conducted. 
  Our community is quite far from adopting any of these standards as expectations. Additionally, pursuing many of these goals might impose significant barriers to conducting research ethically, as educational data can often not be sufficiently anonymized to prevent disclosing identity. Therefore, these supplementary materials are not required for review, but we encourage you to include them where feasible and ethical.  
 The ACM has adopted a new policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  that requires research to be conducted in accordance with ethical and legal standards. In accordance with the policy, your methods description should briefly describe how these standards were met. This can be as simple as a sentence that your study design was reviewed by a local review board (IRB), or a few sentences with key details if you engaged with human subjects and an IRB review was not appropriate to your context or work. Read the ACM policy for additional details.  
 How should we report statistics?   
 The world is moving beyond p-values  , but computing education, like most of academia, still relies on them  . When reporting the results of statistical hypothesis tests, it is critical to report:  
 The test  used 
  The rationale  for choosing the test, including a discussion of the data characteristics that allowed this test to be used 
  The test statistic  computed 
  The actual p-value  (not just whether it was greater than or less than an arbitrary threshold) 
  An effect size  and its confidence intervals. 
  Effect sizes are especially relevant, as they indicate the extent to which something impacts or explains some phenomena in computing education; small effect sizes might not be that significant to learning. The above data should be reported regardless of whether a hypothesis test was significant. Chapters that introduce statistical methods can be found in the Cambridge Handbook of Computing Education Research  .  
 Do not assume that reviewers or future readers have a deep understanding of statistical methods (although they might). If you’re using more advanced or non-standard techniques, justify them in detail, so that the reviewers and future readers understand your choice of methods. We recognize that length limits might prevent a detailed explanation of methods for entirely unfamiliar readers; reviewers are expected to not criticize papers for excluding extensive explanations when there was not space to include them.  
 How should we report on qualitative methods?   
 Best practices in other fields for addressing the reliability of qualitative methods suggest providing detailed arguments and rationale for qualitative approaches and analyses. Some fields that rely on qualitative methods have moved toward a recoverability  criterion, which like replicability in quantitative methods, aims to ensure a study’s core methods are available for inspection and interpretation; however, recoverability does not imply repeatability, as qualitative methods rely on interpretation, which may not be repeatable.  
 When qualitative data is counted and used for quantitative methods, authors should report on the inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the qualitative judgements underlying those counts. There are many ways of calculating inter-rater reliability  , each with tradeoffs. However, note that IRR analysis is not ubiquitous across social sciences  , and not always appropriate; authors should make a clear soundness argument for why it was or was not performed.  
 Another challenge in reporting qualitative results is that they require more space in a paper; an abundance of quotes, after all, may take considerably more space than a table full of aggregate statistics. Be careful to provide enough evidence of your claims, while being mindful with your use of space.  
 What makes a good abstract?   
 A good abstract should summarize the question your paper asks and what answers it found. It is not enough to just say “We discuss our results and their implications”; say what you actually discovered, so future readers can learn that from your summary.  
 If your paper is empirical in nature, ICER recommends (but does not require) using a structured abstract  that contains the following sections, each 1-2 sentences:  
 Background and Context.  What is the problem space you are working in? Which phenomena are you considering and why are they relevant and important for an ICER audience? 
  Objectives.  What research questions were you trying to answer? 
  Method.  What did you do to answer your research questions? 
  Findings.  What did you discover? Both positive and negative results should be summarized. 
  Implications.  What implications does your discovery have on prior and future research, and on the practice of computing education? 
  Not all papers may fit this structure, but if yours does, it will greatly help reviewers and future readers understand your paper’s research design and contribution.  
 What counts as plagiarism?   
 Read ACM’s policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  ; these criteria will be applied during review. In particular, attention will be paid to avoiding redundant publication.  
 Who should be an author on my paper?   
 ICER follows ACM’s Authorship Policy  and Publications Policy on the Withdrawal, Correction, Retraction, and Removal of Works from ACM Publications and ACM DL  . These state that any person listed as an author on a paper must (1) have made substantial contributions to the work, (2) have participated in drafting/revising the paper, (3) be aware that the paper has been submitted, and (4) agree to be held accountable for the content of the paper. Note that this policy allows enforcement of plagiarism sanctions, but it could impact people who work in large, collaborative research groups, and on postgraduate advisors who have not contributed directly to a paper.  
 Must submissions be in English?   
 At the moment, yes. Our reviewing community’s only lingua franca is English, and any other language would greatly limit the pool of expert reviewers to evaluate your work. We recognize that this is a challenging barrier for many authors globally, and that it greatly limits the diversity of voices in global discourse on computing education. Therefore, we wish to express our support of other computing education conferences around the world that you might consider submitting papers to. To mitigate this somewhat, papers will not be penalized for minor English spelling and grammar errors that can easily be corrected with minor revisions.

    1. Goals of the ICER Reviewing Process  
 The ICER Reviewing Process as outlined in this document is designed to support reaching the following goals:  
 Accept high quality papers 
  Give clear feedback to papers of insufficient quality 
  Evaluate papers consistently 
  Provide transparency in the review process 
  Embrace diversity of perspectives, but work in an inclusive, safe, collegial environment 
  Drive decisions by consensus among reviewers 
  Strive for manageable workload for PC members 
  Do our best on all of the above 
    2. Action Items  
 Prior to continuing to read this document, please do the following:  
 Read the call for papers at | https://icer2024.acm.org/track/icer-2024-papers | . This is the ground truth for scope and submission requirements. We expect you to account for these in your reviews. 
  Read the author guidelines at | https://icer2024.acm.org/track/icer-2024-papers#Author-Guidelines | . We expect your reviews and meta-reviews to be consistent with these guidelines. After having read this document, please block off a number of time slots in your calendar: 
  PC/Reviewers   
 Key dates:  
 Prior to March 29, 2024: Familiarize yourself with the ICER 2024 Reviewing Guidelines 
  March 22 – 29, 2024: Bid on papers and declare conflicts 
  March 29 – April 26, 2024: Review roughly 5 papers, depending on submission volume 
  April 26 – May 6, 2024: Asynchronously discuss papers with other reviewers and the Senior PC members assigned to your papers. 
  SPC/Meta-Reviewers   
 Key dates:  
 Prior to March 29, 2024: Familiarize yourself with the ICER 2024 Reviewing Guidelines 
  March 22 – 29, 2024: Bid on papers and declare conflicts 
  March 29 – April 26, 2024: Monitor the reviewing of 7-9 papers, depending on submission volume 
  April 26 – May 6, 2024: Asynchronously discuss papers with the reviewers assigned to those papers, prepare meta-review and recommendation. 
  Tuesday May 7, 2024: Complete submission of meta-reviews for all papers 
  Friday May 10 – Wednesday May 15, 2024: Skim the paper and read reviews for 1-2 submissions (which you did not handle) that will be discussed at the Senior PC meeting. 
  Wednesday May 15 – Friday May 17, 2024: Participate in synchronous, online SPC meetings to discuss and decide on papers without consensus and finalize your meta-reviews. Based on last year’s experiences, we are currently planning for up to four such virtual meetings to accommodate different time zones. As last year, we also expect that your participation in two of these meetings would be necessary and sufficient. Overall, expect it to be a four-hours commitment during this week, plus time to review your 1-2 assigned discussion papers. 
  Thursday May 30 – Thursday June 6, 2024: Re-check (a hopefully very, very small number of) minor revisions against the requests made in “conditional accept” decisions. 
  If you are new to reviewing in the Computing Education Research community, the following ITiCSE Working Group Report may serve as an introduction:  
 Petre M, Sanders K, McCartney R, Ahmadzadeh M, Connolly C, Hamouda S, Harrington B, Lumbroso J, Maguire J, Malmi L, McGill MM, Vahrenhold J. 2020. “Mapping the Landscape of Peer Review in Computing Education Research.” In ITiCSE-WGR ’20: Proceedings of the Working Group Reports on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, edited by Rφίling G, Krogstie B, 173-209. New York, NY: ACM Press. doi: 10.1145/3437800.3439207. 
    3. Submission System  
 ICER 2024 uses the HotCRP platform for its reviewing process. If you are unfamiliar with this, you will find a basic tutorial below. But first, make sure you can sign in, then bookmark it: http://icer2024.hotcrp.com  If you have trouble signing in, or you need help with anything, contact Rodrigo Duran rodrigo.duran@ifms.edu.br  and Juho Leinonen juho.2.leinonen@aalto.fi  , the ICER 2024 submission chairs, for help. Make sure that you can log in to HotCRP and that your name and other metadata is correct. Check that emails from HotCRP are not marked as spam and that HotCRP email notifications are enabled.  
   4. Roles in the Review Process  
 Program Committee (PC) Chairs   
 Each year there are two program committee co-chairs. The PC chairs are solicited by the ICER steering committee and appointed by the SIGCSE board to serve a two-year term. One new appointment is made each year so that in any given year there is always a continuing program chair from the prior year and a new program chair. Appointment criteria include prior attendance and publication at ICER, past service on the ICER Program Committee, research excellence in Computing Education, collaborative and organizational skills to share oversight of the program selection process. The ICER Steering Committee solicits and selects candidates for future PC chairs.  
 Program Committee (PC) Members / Reviewers   
 PC members write reviews of submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. The PC chairs invite and appoint the reviewers. The committee is sized so that each reviewer will serve for 5-6 paper submissions, or more depending on the size of the submissions pool. Each reviewer will serve a one-year term, with no limits on reappointment. Appointment criteria include expertise in relevant areas of computing education research and past reviewing experience in computing education research venues. Together, all reviewers constitute the program committee (PC). The PC chairs are responsible for inviting returning and new members of the PC, keeping in mind the various forms of diversity that are present at ICER.  
 Senior Program Committee Members (SPC) / Meta-Reviewers   
 SPC members review the PC members’ reviews, ensuring that the review content is constructive and aligned with the review criteria, as well as summarizing reviews and making recommendations for a paper’s acceptance and rejection. They also moderate discussions about each paper and provide feedback on reviews if necessary, asking reviewers to improve the quality of reviews. Finally, they participate in a synchronous SPC meeting to make final recommendations about each paper, and review authors’ minor revisions. The PC chairs invite and appoint Senior PC members, with the approval of the steering committee, again, keeping in mind the various forms of diversity that are present at ICER. Each Senior PC member can be appointed for up to three years in a row; after a hiatus of at least one year, preferably two years, re-appointment is possible. The committee is sized so that each meta-reviewer will handle 8-10 papers, depending on the submission pool.  
   5. Principles Behind ICER Reviewing  
 The ICER review process is designed to work towards these goals:  
 Maximize the alignment between a paper and expertise required to review it. 
  Minimize conflicts of interests and promoting trust in the process. 
  Maximize our community’s ability to make excellent, rigorous, trustworthy contributions to the science of computing education. 
  The call for papers and author guide should make this clear, but ICER is broadly scoped. The conference publishes research on teaching and learning of computer science content that happens in any context. In consequence, reviewers should not downgrade papers for being about a topic they personally perceive to be less important to computing education. If the work is sufficiently ready for publication and reviewers believe it is of interest to some part of the computing education community, it should be published such that the community can decide its importance over time.  
   6. Conflicts of Interest  
 ICER takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the ICER conference is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that he or she can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (SPC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
   7. The Reviewing Process  
 Step 1: Authors Submit Abstracts   
 Authors will submit a title and abstract one week prior to assigning papers. Authors are allowed to revise their title and abstract before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and Meta-Reviewers Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and meta-reviewers will be asked to bid on papers for which they have sufficient expertise (in both phenomena and methods) and then the PC chairs will assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is not to express interest in papers you want to read. It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes.  
 Specify all of your conflicts of interest. Conflicts are any situation where you have any connection with a submission that is in tension with your role as an independent reviewer (you advised an author, you have collaborated with an author, you are at the same institution, you are close friends, etc.). After declaring conflicts, you will be excluded from all future evaluation, discussion, and decisions of that paper. Program chairs and submissions chairs will also specify conflicts of interest at this time. 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. Sufficient expertise includes knowledge of research methods used and prior research on the phenomena. Practical knowledge of a topic is helpful, but insufficient. 
  Do not bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you strongly oppose. That precludes authors from being fairly reviewed by authors with negative bias; see below for positive biases and how to control for them. 
  Step 3: Authors Submit Papers   
 Submissions are due one week after the abstracts are due. As you read in the submission instructions ( https://icer2024.acm.org/track/icer-2024-papers#Submission-Instructions  ), submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous that a reader cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of ICER’s anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. (Most guesses will be wrong anyway.) See the submission instructions for what constitutes sufficient anonymization. When in doubt, write the PC chairs for clarity at pc-chairs@icer.acm.org  .  
 Step 4: PC Chairs Decide on Desk-Rejects   
 The PC chairs, with the help of the submissions chairs, will review each submission for papers that violate anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk rejected papers will be notified immediately. The PC chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during review that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the chairs before you write a review; the PC chairs will make the final judgement about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 PC chairs with conflicts are excluded from deciding on desk rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other program chair.  
 Step 5: PC Chairs Assign Reviewers   
 Based on the bids and their judgement, the PC chairs will collaboratively assign at least three reviewers (PC members) and one meta-reviewer (SPC member) for each submission. The PC chairs will be advised by HotCRP’s assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. Remember, for these assignments to be fair and good, your bids should only be based on your expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding on a paper. The chairs will review the algorithm’s assignments to identify potential misalignments with expertise. Managing Conflicts of Interest PC chairs with conflicts are excluded from assigning reviewers to any papers for which they have a conflict. Assignments in HotCRP can only be made by a PC chair without a conflict.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned reviewers submit their anonymous reviews through HotCRP by the review deadline, evaluating each of their papers against the review criteria (see Review Criteria). The time allocated for reviews is four weeks in which 5-6 reviews need to be written. Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, there cannot be any extensions.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers they are conflicted on during this process.  
 Step 6b: Meta-Reviewers and PC Chairs Monitor Progress   
 Meta-reviewers and PC chairs will periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made.  
 Step 7: Reviewers and Meta-Reviewers Discuss Reviews   
 After the reviewing period, the assigned meta-reviewer asks the reviewers to read the other reviewers’ reviews and begin a discussion about any disagreements that arise. All reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the review criteria to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgements. 
  If your judgement does shift, update your review to reflect your new views. There is no need to indicate to the authors that you changed your review but do leave a comment for the other reviewers and the meta-reviewer indicating what you changed and why (HotCRP does not track changes). Discussing a paper is not about who wins or who is right. It is about how, in the light of all information, a group of reviewers can find the best decision on a paper. All reviewers (and the authors!) have their unique perspective and competence. It is perfectly normal that they may have seen things you have not, just as you may have seen things they have not. The important thing is to accept that the group will see more than the individual. Therefore, you can always (and are encouraged to!) shift your stance in light of the extra knowledge.  
 PC chairs will periodically check in. If you have configured HotCRP notifications correctly, you will be notified as soon as new information (another review or a new discussion item) about your paper comes in. It is important that you react to these, and as soon as possible. Do not let your colleagues wait for days when all that is needed is some short statement from your side.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the discussions of the papers they are conflicted on during this process.  
 Step 8: Meta-Reviewers Write Meta-Reviews   
 After the discussion phase, meta-reviewers use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the work to write a meta-review and recommendation. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper, in light of the review criteria, and explain how these led to the decision. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to ICER standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient. There are four possible meta-review recommendations: reject, discuss, conditional accept, and accept. The recommendation needs to be entered in the meta-review.  
 Reject. Ensure that the meta-review constructively summarizes the reviews and the rationale for rejection. The PC chairs will review all meta-reviews to ensure that reviews are constructive, and may request meta-reviewers to revise their meta-reviews as necessary. The PC chairs will make the final rejection decision based on the meta-review rationale; if necessary, this paper will be discussed at the SPC meeting. 
  Discuss. Ensure that the meta-review summarizes the open questions that need to be resolved at the SPC meeting discussion, where the paper will either be recommended as reject, conditional accept, or accept. Papers marked discussed will be scheduled for discussion at the SPC meeting. All papers for which the opinion of the meta-reviewer and the majority of reviewer recommendations do not align should be marked “discuss” as well. 
  Conditional Accept. Ensure that the meta-review explicitly and clearly states the conditions that must be met with minor revisions before the paper can be accepted. To accept with conditions, the conditions must be feasible to make within the one-week revision period, so they must be minor. The PC chairs will make the final decision on whether the requested revisions are minor enough to warrant conditional acceptance; if necessary, this paper will be discussed at the SPC meeting. 
  Accept. These papers will be accepted, assuming authors deanonymize the paper and meet the final version deadline. For technical reasons, “accept” recommendations are recorded internally as “conditional accept” recommendations that do not state any conditions for acceptance other than submitting the final version. The PC chairs will make the final acceptance decision based on the meta-review rationale; if necessary, this paper will be discussed at the SPC meeting. 
  Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the recommendations or meta-reviews of the papers they are conflicted on during this process.  
 Step 9: PC Chairs and Meta-Reviewers Discuss Papers   
 The PC chairs will host synchronous SPC meetings with all available meta-reviewers (SPC members) to discuss and decide on all “discuss” and “conditional accept” papers. Before this meeting, a second meta-reviewer will be assigned to each such paper, ensuring that there are at least two meta-reviewers to facilitate discussion. Each meta-reviewer assigned to a paper should come prepared to present the paper, its reviews, and the HotCRP discussion. Each meta-reviewer’s job is to present their recommendation, and/or if they requested discussion, present the uncertainty that prevents them from making one. All meta-reviewers who are available to attend a SPC meeting session should, at a minimum, skim each of the papers to be discussed and their reviews (excluding those for which they are conflicted), so they are familiar with the papers and their reviews prior to the discussions. At the meeting, the goal is to collectively reach consensus, rather than relying on the PC chairs alone to make final decisions. Papers may move from “discuss” to either “reject”, “conditional accept”, or “accept”; if there are conditions, they must be approved by a majority of the non-conflicted SPC and PC chairs at the discussion. After a decision is made in each case, the original SPC member will add a summary of the discussion at the end of their meta-review, explaining the rationale for the final decision, as well as any conditions for acceptance, and updating the recommendation tag in HotCRP.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Meta-reviewers conflicted on a paper will not be assigned as a second reader. Any meta-reviewer or PC chair conflicted on a paper will be excluded from the paper’s discussion, returning after the discussion is over.  
 Step 10: PC Chair Review   
 Before announcing decisions, the non-conflicted PC chairs will review all meta-reviews to ensure as much clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 PC chairs cannot change the outcome of an accept or reject decision after the SPC meeting.  
 Step 11: Notifications   
 After the SPC meeting, the PC chairs will notify all authors of the decisions about their papers; these notification will be via email through HotCRP. Papers that are (unconditionally) accepted will be encouraged to make any changes that may have been suggested but not required; papers that are conditionally accepted will be reminded of the revision evaluation deadline.  
 Step 12: Authors of Conditionally Accepted Papers Revise their Papers   
 Authors of conditionally accepted papers have one week to incorporate the requested revisions and to submit their final versions for review by the assigned meta-reviewer.  
 Step 13: Meta-Reviewers Check Revised Papers   
 Meta-reviewers will check the revised papers against the required revisions. Based on the outcome of this, they will change their recommendation to either “accept” or “reject” and will update their meta-reviews to reflect this.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the recommendations or meta-reviews of the papers they are conflicted on during this process.  
 Step 14: Notifications   
 PC chairs will sanity-check all comments on those papers for which revisions were submitted. Conditionally accepted papers for which not revisions were received will be marked as “reject”. PC chairs then finalize decisions. After this review, all recommendations will be converted to official accept or reject decisions in HotCRP and authors will be notified of these final decisions via email sent through HotCRP. Authors will then have one week to submit to ACM TAPS for final publication.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the recommendations or meta-reviews of the papers they are conflicted on during this process. PC chairs with conflicts cannot see or edit any final decision on these papers.  
   8. Review Criteria  
 ICER currently evaluates papers against the following reviewing criteria, as independently as possible. These have been carefully chosen to be inclusive to many phenomena, epistemologies, and contribution types.  
 Criterion A: The submission is grounded in relevant prior work and leverages available theory when appropriate. 
  Criterion B: The submission describes its methods and/or innovations sufficiently for others to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how an innovation works. 
  Criterion C: The submission’s methods and/or innovations soundly address its research questions. 
  Criterion D: The submission advances knowledge of computing education by addressing (possibly novel) questions that are of interest to the computing education community. 
  Criterion E: Discussion of results clearly summarizes the submission’s contributions beyond prior work and its implications for research and practice. 
  Criterion F: The submission is written clearly enough to publish. 
  To be published at ICER, papers should be positively evaluated on all of these. The summary of this is another criterion:  
 Summary: Based on the criteria above, this paper should be published at ICER. 
  Below, we discuss each criterion in turn.  
   Criterion A: The submission is grounded in relevant prior work and leverages available theory when appropriate.  
 Papers should draw on relevant prior work and theories, and explicitly show how they are tied to the questions addressed. After reading the paper, one should feel more informed about prior literature and how that literature is related to the paper’s contributions. Such coverage of related work might come before a work’s contributions, or it might come after (e.g, connecting a new theory derived from observations to prior work. Note that not all types of research will have relevant theory to discuss, nor do all contribution types need theory to make significant advances. For example, a surprisingly robust but unexplained correlation might be an important discovery that later work could develop theory to explain. Reviewers should identify related work the authors might have missed and include pointers. Missing a paper that is relevant, but would not dramatically change the paper, is not sufficient grounds for rejecting a paper. Such citations can be added upon reviewers’ request prior to publication. Instead, criticism in reviews that leads to downgrading a paper should focus on missing prior work or theories that would significantly alter research questions, analysis, or interpretation of results.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since prior work and theories needs to be covered sufficiently and in a meaningful way but not necessarily completely, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from downgrading work based on missing one or two peripherally related papers. Just note them, helping the authors to broaden their citations. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on not citing the reviewer’s own work, unless it really is objectively highly relevant. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on where in a paper they address prior work. Sometimes a dedicated section is appropriate, sometimes it is not. Sometimes prior work is better addressed at the end of a paper, not at the beginning. 
  Make sure to critically note if work simply lists papers without meaningfully addressing their relevance to the paper’s questions or innovations. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on making discoveries inconsistent with theory. The point of empirical work is to test and refine theories, not conform to them. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on not building upon theory when there is no sufficient theory available that can be pointed out in the review. Conversely, if there is a missing and relevant theory, it should be named. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on not using the reviewer’s interpretation of a theory. Many theories have multiple competing interpretations and multiple distinct facets that can be seen from multiple perspectives. 
    Criterion B: The submission describes its methods and/or innovations sufficiently for others to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how an innovation works.  
 An ICER paper should be self-contained in the sense that readers should be able to understand most of the key details about how the authors conducted their work or made their innovation possible. This is key for replication and meta-analysis of studies that come from positivist or post-positivist epistemologies. For interpretivist works, it is also key for what Checkland and Howell called “recoverability” (See Tracy et al. 2010 for a detailed overview for evaluating qualitative work). Reviews thus should focus on omissions of research process or innovation details that would significantly alter your judgment of the paper’s validity.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since ICER papers have to adhere to a word count limit and since there are always more details a paper can describe about methods, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from downgrading work based on not describing every detail. 
  Refrain from asking authors to write substantially new method details unless you can identify content for them to cut, or there is space to add those details within the length restrictions. 
  Refrain from asking authors of theory contributions for a traditional methods section; such contributions do not require them, as they are not empirical in nature. 
  Feel free to ask authors for minor revisions that would support replication or meta-analysis for positivist or post-positivist works, and recoverability for interpretivist works using qualitative methods. 
    Criterion C: The submission’s methods and/or innovations soundly address its research questions.  
 The paper should answer the questions it poses, and it should do so with rigor, broadly construed. This is the single most important difference between research papers and other kinds of knowledge sharing in computing education (e.g., experience reports), and the source of certainty researchers can offer. Note that soundness is relative to claims. For example, if a paper claims to have provided evidence of causality, but its methods did not do that, that would be grounds for critique. But if a paper only claimed to have found a correlation, and that correlation is a notable discovery that future work could explain, downgrading it for not demonstrating causality would be inappropriate.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since soundness is relative to claims and methods, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from applying criteria for quantitative methods to qualitative methods (e.g., critiquing a case study for a “small N” makes no sense; that is the point of a case study). 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on a lack of a statistically significant difference if the study demonstrates sufficient power to detect a difference. A lack of difference can be discovery, too. 
  Refrain from asking for the paper to do more than it claims if the demonstrated claims are sufficiently publishable (e.g., “I would publish this if it had also demonstrated knowledge transfer”). 
  Refrain from relying on inexpert, anecdotal judgments (e.g., “I don’t know much about this but I played with it once and it didn’t work”). 
  Refrain from assuming that because a method has not been used in computing education literature that it is not standard somewhere else. The field draws upon methods from many communities. Look for evidence that the method is used elsewhere. 
    Criterion D: The submission advances knowledge of computing education by addressing (possibly novel) questions that are of interest to the computing education community.  
 A paper can meet the previous criteria and still fail to advance what we know about the phenomena. It is up to the authors to convince you that the discoveries advance our knowledge in some way, e.g., by confirming uncertain prior work, adding a significant new idea, or making progress on a long-standing open question. Secondarily, there should be someone who might find the discovery interesting. It does not have to be interesting to a particular reviewer, and a particular reviewer does not have to be absolutely confident that an audience exists. As the PC cannot possibly reflect the broader audience of all readers, a probable audience is sufficient for publication.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since advances can come in many forms, there are many criticisms that are inappropriate in isolation (if, however, many of these apply, they may justify rejection), and, thus, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from downgrading work because another, single paper was already published on the topic. Discoveries accumulate over many papers, not just one. 
  Refrain from downgrading work that contributes a really new idea for not yet having everything figured out about it. Again, new discoveries may require multiple papers. 
  Refrain from downgrading work because the results do not appear generalizable or were only obtained at a specific institution. Many papers explicitly discuss such limitations and possible remedies. Also, generalizability takes time, and, by their very nature, some qualitative methods do not lead to generalizable results. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on “only” being a replication. Replications, if done with diligence, are important. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on investigating phenomena you personally do not like (e.g., “I hate object-oriented languages, this work does not matter”). 
    Criterion E: Discussion of results clearly summarizes the submission’s contributions beyond prior work and its implications for research and practice.  
 It is the authors’ responsibility to help interpret the significance of a paper’s discoveries. If it makes significant advances, but does not explain what those advances are and why they matter, the paper is not ready for publication. That said, it is perfectly fine if you disagree with the paper’s interpretations or implications. Readers will vary on what they think a discovery means or what impact it might have on the world. All that is necessary is that the work presents some reasonably sound discussion of one possible set of interpretations.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Because there is no single “right” interpretation or discussion of implications, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following  
 Refrain from downgrading work because you do not think the idea would work in your institution. 
  Refrain from downgrading work because you think that the impact is limited. Check the discussion of limitations and threats to validity and evaluate the paper with respect to the claims made. 
  Make sure to critically note if work makes interpretations that are not grounded in evidence or proposes implications that are not grounded in evidence. 
    Criterion F: The submission is written clearly enough to publish.  
 Papers need to be clear and concise, both to be comprehensible to diverse audiences, but also to ensure the community is not overburdened by verboseness. We recognize that not all authors are fluent English writers; if, however, the paper requires significant editing to be comprehensible to fluent English readers, or it is unnecessarily verbose, it is not yet ready for publication.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since submissions should be clear enough, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from downgrading work based on having easily fixed spelling and grammar issues. 
  Refrain from downgrading a sufficiently clear paper because it could be clearer. All writing can be clearer in some way. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on not using all of the available word count. It is okay if a paper is short but significant. 
  Refrain from asking for more detail unless you are certain there is space or - if there is not space - you can provide concrete suggestions for what to cut. 
    Summary: Based on the criteria above, this paper should be published at ICER.  
 Based on all of the previous criteria, decide how strongly you believe the paper should be accepted or rejected, assuming authors make any modest, straightforward minor revisions you and other reviewers request before publication. Papers that meet all of the criteria should be strongly accepted (though this does not imply that they are perfect). Papers that fail to meet most of the criteria should be strongly rejected. Each paper should be reviewed independently of others, as if it were a standalone journal submission. There are no conference presentation “slots”; there is no target acceptance rate. Neither should be a factor in reviewing individual submissions.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Because each paper should be judged on its own, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from recommending to accept a paper because it was the best in your set. It is possible that none of your papers sufficiently meet the criteria. 
  Refrain from recommending to reject a paper because it should not take up a “slot”. The PC chairs will devise a program for however many papers sufficiently meet the criteria, whether that is 5 or 50. There is no need to preemptively design the program through your review; focus on the criteria. 
    9. Award Recommendations  
 On the review form, reviewers may signal to the meta-reviewer and PC chairs that they believe the submission should be considered for a best paper award. Selecting this option in the review form is visible to the other (meta-)reviewers as part of your review, but it is not disclosed to the authors. Reviewers should recognize papers that best illustrate the highest standards of computing education research, taking into account the quality of its questions asked, methodology, analysis, writing, and contribution to the field. This includes papers that meet all of the review criteria in exemplary ways (e.g., research that was particularly well designed, executed, and communicated), or papers that meet specific review criteria in exemplary ways (e.g., discoveries are particularly significant or sound). The meta-review form for each paper includes an option to officially nominate a paper to the Awards Committee for the best-paper award. Reviewers may flag papers for award consideration during review, but meta-reviewers are ultimately responsible for nominating papers for the best paper award. Each meta-reviewer may nominate at most two papers for the best paper award. Nominated papers may or may not have been flagged by one or more reviewers. Nominations should be recorded in HotCRP and be accompanied by a paragraph outlining the rationale for nomination. NOTE: Whether a paper has been nominated and the accompanying rationale are not disclosed to the authors as part of the meta-review.  
  Meta-reviewers are encouraged to review and finalize their nominations at the conclusion of the SPC meeting to allow for possible calibration. Once paper decisions have been sent, the submission chair will make PDFs and the corresponding rationales for all nominated papers available to the Awards Chair. Additionally, a list of all meta-reviewers that have handled any nominated paper or have one or more conflicts of interest with any nominated paper will be disclosed to the Awards Chair, as those members are not eligible to serve on the Awards Committee.  
   10. Possible Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  
 If after reading a submission, you suspect that it has in some way plagiarized from some other source, do the following:  
 Read the | ACM guidelines on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification | . 
  If you think there is a potential issue, write the PC chairs at | pc-chairs@icer.acm.org | to escalate the potential violation, and share any information you have about the case. Authors are required to disclose any potentially overlapping work to the PC chairs upon submission. 
  The chairs will investigate and decide as necessary prior to the acceptance notification deadline. You should not mark the paper for rejection based on suspected plagiarism. Mark it based on the paper as it stands, while the PC chairs investigate.  
   11. Practical Suggestions for Writing Reviews  
 The following suggestions may be helpful when reviewing papers:  
 Before reading, remind yourself of the preceding reviewing criteria. 
  Read the paper, and as you do, note positive and negative aspects for each of the preceding reviewing criteria. 
  Use your notes to outline a review organized by the seven criteria, so authors can understand your judgments for each criterion. 
  Draft your review based on your outline. 
  Edit your review, making it as constructive and clear as possible. Even a very negative review should be respectful to the author(s), helping to educate them. Avoid comments about the author(s) themselves; focus on the document. 
  Based on your review, choose scores for each of the criteria. 
  Based on your review and scores, choose a recommendation score and decide whether to recommend the paper for consideration for a best paper award. 
  Thank you very much for reading this document and thank you very much for being part of the ICER reviewing process. Do not hesitate to email the Program Co-Chairs at pc-chairs@icer.acm.org  if you have any questions.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Aims and Scope   
 The 20th annual ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER) aims to gather high-quality contributions to the Computing Education Research discipline. The “Research Papers” track invites submissions describing original research results related to any aspect of teaching and learning computing, from introductory through advanced material. Submissions are welcome from across the research methods used in Computing Education Research and related fields. Each contribution will be assessed based on:  
 the appropriateness and soundness of its methods 
  its relevance to teaching or learning computing, and 
  the depth of its contribution to the community’s understanding of the question at hand. 
  Research areas of particular interest include:  
 design-based research, learner-centered design, and evaluation of educational technology supporting computing knowledge or skills development, 
  discipline based education research (DBER) about computing, computer science, and related disciplines, 
  informal learning experiences related to programming and software development (all ages), ranging from after-school programs for children, to end-user development communities, to workplace training of computing professionals, 
  learnability of programming languages and tools for learning programming and computing concepts, 
  learning analytics and educational data mining in computing education contexts, 
  learning sciences work in the computing content domain, 
  measurement instrument development and validation (e.g., concept inventories, attitudes scales, etc) for use in computing disciplines, 
  pedagogical environments fostering computational thinking, 
  psychology of programming, 
  rigorous replication of empirical work, relevant to computing education, to compare with or extend previous empirical research results, 
  professional development for computing educators at all levels. 
  While this above list is non-exclusive, authors are also invited to consider the call for papers for the “Lightning Talks & Posters” and “Work-in-Progress” tracks if in doubt about the suitability of their work for this track.  
 Please see the Submission Instructions  for details on how to prepare your submission. It includes links to the relevant ACM policies including the ACM Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  as well as the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.   
 All questions about this call should go to the ICER 2024 program committee chairs at pc-chairs@icer.acm.org  .

 Submission Instructions  
   
 Submission Process   
 Submit at the ICER 2024 HotCRP site  .  
 When you submit the abstract or full version ready for review, you need to perform the following actions:  
 Check the checkbox “ready for review” at the bottom of the submission form. (Otherwise it will be marked as a draft). 
  Check the checkbox “I have read and understood the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  ”. Note: “Where such research is conducted in countries where no such local governing laws and regulations related to human participant and subject research exist, Authors must at a bare minimum be prepared to show compliance with the above detailed principles.” 
  Check the checkbox “I have read and understood the ACM Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  ; in particular, no version of this work is under submission elsewhere.”. Make sure to disclose possible overlap with your own previous work (“redundant publication”) to the ICER Program Committee co-chairs  . 
  Check the checkbox “I have read and understood the ICER Anonymization Policy” (see below). 
  ICER Anonymization Policy   
 ICER research paper submissions will be reviewed using a double-anonymous process: the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers and the reviewers do not know the identity of the authors. To ensure this:  
 Avoid titles that indicate a clearly identifiable research project. 
  Remove author names and affiliations. (If you are using LaTeX, you can start your document declaration with \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart}  to easily anonymize these. 
  Avoid referring to yourself when citing your own work. 
  Redact (just for review) portions of positionality statements that would identify you within the community (perhaps due to demographics shared by few others). 
  Avoid references to your affiliation. For example, rather than referring to your actual university, you might write “A Large Metropolitan University (ALMU)” rather than “Auckland University of Technology (AUT)”. 
  Redact any other identifying information such as contributors, course numbers, IRB names and numbers, grant titles and numbers, from the main text and the acknowledgements. 
  Omit author details from the PDF you generate, such as author name or the name of the source document. These are often automatically inserted into exported PDFs, so be sure to check your PDF before submission. 
  Do not simply cover identifying details with a black box, as the text can easily be seen from under the box by dragging the cursor over it, and will still be read by screen readers.  
 Work that is not sufficiently anonymized will be desk-rejected by the PC chairs without offering an option to redact and resubmit.   
 Authoring Guidelines   
 The ICER conference maintains an evolving author guide  , full of recommendations about scope, statistics, qualitative methods, theory, and other concerns that may arise when drafting your submission. These guidelines are a ground truth for reviewers; study them closely as you plan your research and prepare your submission.  
 Conflict of Interests   
 The SIGCSE Conflict of Interest policy  applies to all submissions. You can review how conflicts will be managed by consulting our reviewer training  , which details our review process.  
 Submission Format and Publication Workflow   
 Papers submitted to the research track of ICER 2023 have to be prepared according to the ACM TAPS workflow system  . Read this page carefully to understand the new workflow.  
 Starting in 2021, ICER switched to a publication format (called TAPS) that separates content from presentation in support of accessibility. This means that the submission format and the publication format differ. For submission, we standardize on a single-column presentation.  
 The | submission | template is either the single column Word Submission Template or the single column LaTeX (using the “manuscript,review,anonymous” style available in template, which you can see an example of in the | sample-manuscript.tex | example in the LaTeX master template samples). Reviewers will review in this single column format. You can download these templates on the | ACM Master Article Templates | page 
  The | publication | template is either the single column Word Submission Template or LaTeX template using “sigconf” style in acmart. You can download the templates on the | ACM TAPS workflow page | page, where you can also see example papers using the TAPS-compatible Word and LaTeX templates. If your paper is accepted, you will use the TAPS system to generate your final publication outputs. This will involve more than just submitting a PDF, requiring you to instead submit your Word or LaTeX source files and fix any errors in your source before the final version deadline listed above. The final published versions will be the ACM two-column conference PDF format (as well as XML, HTML, and ePub formats in the future). 
  For LaTeX users, be aware that there is a list of approved LaTeX packages  for use with ACM TAPS. Not all packages are allowed.  
 This separation of submission and publication format results in several benefits:  
 Improved quality of paper metadata, improving ACM Digital Library search. 
  Multiple paper output formats, including PDFs, responsive HTML5, XML, and ePub. 
  Improved accessibility of paper content for people with disabilities. 
  Streamlined publication timelines. 
  Submission Length   
 Authors may submit papers up to 11,000 words in length, excluding acknowledgements, references, figures, but including all other text, including tables. To clarify, “all other text” does include appendices. ICER papers must be self-contained in the sense that reviewers can assess the contribution without referring to any external material. Appendices in the submitted PDF are considered to be part of the main text and thus are subject to the word count. If authors want to provide additional material, e.g., codebooks, they must do so in an anonymized way via an external web resource of their choice; reviewers will neither be required nor asked, however, to consult such resources when assessing a paper’s contribution. The PC chairs will use the following procedures for counting words for TAPS approved formats:  
 For papers written in the Microsoft Word template, Word’s built-in word-count mechanism will be used, selecting all text except acknowledgements and references. 
  For papers written in the LaTeX template, the document will be converted to plain text using the “ExtractText” functionality of the Apache pdfbox suite (see | here | ) and then post processed with a standard command-line word count tool (“wc -w”, to be precise). Line numbers added by the “review” class option for LaTeX will be removed prior to counting by using “grep -v -E ‘^[0-9]+$’” (thanks to N. Brown for this). | We acknowledge that many authors may want to use Overleaf to avoid dealing with command-line tools and, consequently, may be less enthusiastic about using another command-line tool for assessing the word count. As it is configured by default, Overleaf does not count text in tables, captions, and math formula and, thus, is very likely to significantly underestimate the number obtained through the tool described above. To obtain a more realistic word count during the writing of the manuscript, authors need to take these additional steps: | Add the following lines at the very beginning of your Overleaf LaTeX document: | %TC:macro \cite [option:text,text] %TC:macro \citep [option:text,text] %TC:macro \citet [option:text,text] %TC:envir table 0 1 %TC:envir table* 0 1 %TC:envir tabular [ignore] word %TC:envir displaymath 0 word %TC:envir math 0 word %TC:envir comment 0 0 | Make sure to write math formulae delimited by | \begin{math} \end{math} | for in-line math and | \begin{displaymath} \end{displaymath} | for equations. Do not use dollar signs or | \[ \] | ; these will result in Overleaf not counting math tokens (unlike Word and pdfbox) and thus underestimate your word count. 
  The above flags will ensure that in-text citations, tables, and math formulae will be counted but that comments will be ignored. 
  The above flags do not cover more advanced LaTeX environments, so if authors use such environments, they should interpret the Overleaf word count with care (then again, if authors know how to work with such environments it is very reasonable to assume that they also know how to work with command-line tools such as pdfbox). 
  Authors relying on Overleaf word count should be advised that the submission chairs will not have access to the source files and cannot re-run or verify any counting mechanism done by the submitting authors. To provide a fair treatment across all submission types, only the approved tools mentioned above will be used for word count. That said, submission chairs will operate under a | bona fide | assumption when it comes to extreme borderline cases. 
  Papers in either format may not use figures to render text in ways that work around the word count limit; papers abusing figures in this way will be desk-rejected. 
  A paper under the word count limit with either of the above approved tools is acceptable. The submissions chairs will evaluate each submission using the procedures above, notify the PC chairs of papers exceeding the limit, and desk-reject any papers that do.  
 We expect papers to vary in word count. Abstracts may vary in length, less than 300 words is a good guideline for conciseness. Submission length should be commensurate with its contributions; we expect most papers to be less than 9,000 words according to the rules above, though some may use up to the limit in order to convey details authors deem necessary to evaluate the work. Papers may be judged as too long if they are repetitive, verbose, violate formatting rules, or use figures to save on word count. Papers may be judged as too short if they omit critical details or ignore relevant prior work. See the reviewer training  for more on how reviewers will be instructed to assess conciseness.  
 All of the procedures above, and the TAPS workflow, will likely undergo continued iteration in partnership with ACM, the ICER Steering Committee, and the SIGCSE board. Notify the chairs of questions, edge cases, and other concerns to help improve this new workflow.  
 Acceptance and Conditional Acceptance   
 All papers recommended for acceptance after the Senior PC meetings are either accepted or conditionally accepted. For accepted papers, there is no resubmission required other than the final camera-ready version. For conditionally-accepted papers, meta-reviews will indicate one or more minor revisions that are necessary for final acceptance; authors are responsible for submitting these revisions to HotCRP prior to the “Conditional Accept revisions due” deadline in the Call for Papers. The Senior PC and Program Chairs will review the final revisions; if they are acceptable, the paper will be officially accepted, and authors will have one week to submit an approved camera-ready version to TAPS for publication. If the Senior PC and Program Chairs judge that the request for revisions were not suitably addressed, the paper will be rejected.  
 Because the turnaround time for conditional acceptance is only one week, requested revisions will necessarily be minor: they may include presentation issues or requests for added clarity or details helpful for future readers of the archived paper. New results, new methodological details that change the interpretation of the results, or other substantially new content will neither be asked for nor allowed to be added.  
 Kudos   
 After a paper has been accepted and uploaded into the ACM Digital Library, authors will receive an invitation from Kudos to create an account and add plain-language text into Kudos on its platform. The Kudos “Shareable PDF” integration with ACM will then allow an author to generate a PDF to upload to websites, such as author homepages, institutional repositories, and preprint services, such as ArXiv. This PDF contains the author’s plain-text summary of the paper as well as a link to the full-text version of an article in the ACM Digital Library, adding to the DL download and citation counts there, as well as adding views from other platforms to the author’s Kudos dashboard.  
 Using Kudos is entirely optional. Authors may also use the other ACM copyright options  to share their work (retaining copyright, paying for open access, etc.).  
 ACM Publications Policy   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
   
 Author Guidelines  
   
 If you are reading this page, you are probably considering submitting to ICER. Congratulations! We are excited to review your work. Whether your research is just starting or nearly finished, this guide is intended to help authors meet the expectations of the computing education research community. It reflects a community-wide perspective on what constitutes rigorous research on the teaching and learning of computing.  
 Read on for our community’s current guidelines, and if you like, read our reviewer guidelines  to understand our review process and review criteria.  
 What’s in scope at ICER?   
 ICER’s goal is to be an inclusive conference, both with respect to epistemology (how we know we know things) and with respect to phenomena (who is learning and in what context). Therefore, any research related to the teaching and learning of computing is in scope, using any definition of computing, and using any methods. We particularly encourage work that goes beyond the community’s past focus on introductory programming courses in post-secondary education: such as work on primary and secondary education, work on more advanced computing concepts, informal learning in any setting or learning amongst adults. (However, note that simply using computing technology to perform research in an educational setting is not in itself enough, the focus must be on the teaching or learning of computing topics.) If you have not seen a particular topic published on a topic at ICER, or you have not seen a particular method be used, that is okay. We value new topics, new methods, new perspectives, and new ideas, just as much as more broadly accepted ones.  
 That said, under the current review process, we cannot promise that we have recruited all the necessary expertise to our program committee to fairly review your work. Check who is on the program committee this year, and if you do not see a lot of expertise on your methods or phenomena, make sure your submission spends a bit of extra time explaining theories or methods that reviewers are unlikely to know. If you have any questions regarding this, email the program chairs ( pc-chairs@icer.acm.org  ).  
 Note that we used the word “research” above. Research is hard to define, but we can say that ICER is not a place to submit practical descriptions of courses, curriculum, or instruction materials you want to share. If you’re looking to share your experiences at a conference, consider submitting to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium’s Experience Report or Position and Curricula Initiatives tracks. Research, in contrast, should meet the criteria presented throughout this document.  
 What makes a good computing education research paper?   
 It’s impossible to anticipate every kind of paper that might be submitted. The current ICER review criteria are listed in the reviewer guidelines  . These will evolve over time as the community grows. There are many other criteria that reviews could discuss in relation to specific types of research contributions, but the criteria listed there are generally inclusive to many epistemologies and contribution types. This includes empirical studies that answer research questions, replicate prior results, or present negative research results as well as other, non-empirical types of research that provide novel or deepened insights into the teaching and learning of computer science content.  
 What prior work should be cited?   
 As with any research work, your submission should cite all significant publications that are relevant to your research questions. With respect to ICER submissions, this may include not only work that has been published in ACM-affiliated venues like ICER, ITiCSE, SIGCSE, Koli Calling, but also the wide range of conferences and journals in the learning sciences, education, educational psychology, HCI, and software engineering. If you are new to research, consider guides on study design  and surveys of prior work like the 2019 Cambridge Handbook of Computing Education Research  , which attempts to survey most of what we know about computing education up to 2018.  
 Papers will be judged on how adequately they are grounded in prior work published across academia. They will also be assessed regarding their accuracy of citing related work: read what you cite closely and ensure the discoveries in published work are supporting your claims; many of the authors of the works you are likely to cite are members of the computing education research community and may be your reviewers. Finally, papers will also be expected to return to prior work in a discussion of a paper’s contributions. All papers should explain how the paper’s contributions advance upon prior work, cause us to reinterpret prior work, or reveal conflicts with prior work.  
 How might theory be used?   
 Different disciplines across academia vary greatly on how they use and develop theory. At the moment, the position of the community is that theory can be a useful tool for framing research, connecting it to prior work, and interpreting findings. Papers can also contribute new theories, or refine them. However, it may also be possible for papers to be atheoretical, discovering interesting new relationships or interventions that cannot yet be explained. All of these uses of theory are appropriate.  
 It is also possible to misuse theory. Sometimes the theories used are too general for a question, where a theory more specific to computing education might be appropriate. In other cases, a theory might be wrongly applied to some phenomena, or a paper might use a theory that has been discredited. Be careful when using theory to understand its history, its body of evidence in support of and against its claims, and its scope of relevance.  
 Note that our community has discussed the role of theory multiple times, and that conversations about how to use theory are evolving:  
 Nelson and Ko (2018)  argued that there are tensions between expectations of theory building and innovative exploration of design ideas, and that our field’s theory building should focus on theories specific to computing education. 
  Malmi et al. (2019)  found that while computing education researchers have widely cited many dozens of unique theoretical ideas about learning, behavior, beliefs, and other phenomena, the use of theory in the field remains somewhat shallow. 
  Kafai et al. (2019)  argued that there are many types of theories, and that we should more deeply leverage their explanatory potential, especially theories about the sociocultural and societal factors at play in computing education, not just the cognitive factors. 
  In addition to using theories when appropriate, ICER encourages the contribution of new theories. There is not a community-level consensus on what constitutes a good theory contribution, but there are examples  you might learn from. Papers proposing a new theoretical model should consider including concrete examples of said model.  
 How should educational contexts be described?   
 If you’re reporting empirical work in a specific education context or set of contexts, it is important to remember that our research community is global, and that education systems across the world are structured differently. This is of particular importance when describing research that took place in primary and secondary schools. Keep in mind that not all readers can be familiar with your educational context. Describe the structure of the educational system. Define terminology related to your education system. Characterize who is teaching, and what prior knowledge and preparation they have. When describing learners, at a minimum, describe their gender, race, ethnicity, age, level in school, and prior knowledge (assuming collecting and publishing this type of data is legal in the context in which the study was conducted, see also the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  ). Include information about other structural factors that might affect how the results are interpreted, including whether courses are required or elective, what incentives students have to enrol in courses, how students in courses vary. For authors in the United States, common terminology to avoid include “elementary school”, “middle school”, “high school”, and “college”, which do not have well-defined meanings elsewhere. Use the more common globally inclusive phrases “primary”, “secondary”, and “post-secondary”. Given the broad spectrum of, e.g., introductory computing courses that run under the umbrella of “CS1”, make sure to provide enough information on the course content rather than relying on an assumed shared understanding.  
 What details should we report about our methods?   
 ICER values a wide range of methods of all kinds, including quantitative, qualitative, design, argumentation, and more. It is critical to describe your methods in detail, both so that reviewers and readers can understand how you arrived at your conclusions, and so they can evaluate the appropriateness of your methods both to the work and, for readers, to their own contexts.  
 Some contributions might benefit from following the Center for Open Science’s recommendations  to ensure replicable, transparent science. These include practices such as:  
 Data should be posted to a trusted repository. 
  Data in that repository is properly cited in the paper. 
  Any code used for analysis is posted to a trusted repository. 
  Results are independently reproduced. 
  Materials used for the study are posted to a trusted repository. 
  Studies and their analysis plans are pre-registered prior to being conducted. 
  Our community is quite far from adopting any of these standards as expectations. Additionally, pursuing many of these goals might impose significant barriers to conducting research ethically, as educational data can often not be sufficiently anonymized to prevent disclosing identity. Therefore, these supplementary materials are not required for review, but we encourage you to include them where feasible and ethical.  
 The ACM has adopted a new policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  that requires research to be conducted in accordance with ethical and legal standards. In accordance with the policy, your methods description should briefly describe how these standards were met. This can be as simple as a sentence that your study design was reviewed by a local review board (IRB), or a few sentences with key details if you engaged with human subjects and an IRB review was not appropriate to your context or work. Read the ACM policy for additional details.  
 How should we report statistics?   
 The world is moving beyond p-values  , but computing education, like most of academia, still relies on them  . When reporting the results of statistical hypothesis tests, it is critical to report:  
 The test  used 
  The rationale  for choosing the test, including a discussion of the data characteristics that allowed this test to be used 
  The test statistic  computed 
  The actual p-value  (not just whether it was greater than or less than an arbitrary threshold) 
  An effect size  and its confidence intervals. 
  Effect sizes are especially relevant, as they indicate the extent to which something impacts or explains some phenomena in computing education; small effect sizes might not be that significant to learning. The above data should be reported regardless of whether a hypothesis test was significant. Chapters that introduce statistical methods can be found in the Cambridge Handbook of Computing Education Research  .  
 Do not assume that reviewers or future readers have a deep understanding of statistical methods (although they might). If you’re using more advanced or non-standard techniques, justify them in detail, so that the reviewers and future readers understand your choice of methods. We recognize that length limits might prevent a detailed explanation of methods for entirely unfamiliar readers; reviewers are expected to not criticize papers for excluding extensive explanations when there was not space to include them.  
 How should we report on qualitative methods?   
 Best practices in other fields for addressing the reliability of qualitative methods suggest providing detailed arguments and rationale for qualitative approaches and analyses. Some fields that rely on qualitative methods have moved toward a recoverability  criterion, which like replicability in quantitative methods, aims to ensure a study’s core methods are available for inspection and interpretation; however, recoverability does not imply repeatability, as qualitative methods rely on interpretation, which may not be repeatable.  
 When qualitative data is counted and used for quantitative methods, authors should report on the inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the qualitative judgements underlying those counts. There are many ways of calculating inter-rater reliability  , each with tradeoffs. However, note that IRR analysis is not ubiquitous across social sciences  , and not always appropriate; authors should make a clear soundness argument for why it was or was not performed.  
 Another challenge in reporting qualitative results is that they require more space in a paper; an abundance of quotes, after all, may take considerably more space than a table full of aggregate statistics. Be careful to provide enough evidence of your claims, while being mindful with your use of space.  
 What makes a good abstract?   
 A good abstract should summarize the question your paper asks and what answers it found. It is not enough to just say “We discuss our results and their implications”; say what you actually discovered, so future readers can learn that from your summary.  
 If your paper is empirical in nature, ICER recommends (but does not require) using a structured abstract  that contains the following sections, each 1-2 sentences:  
 Background and Context.  What is the problem space you are working in? Which phenomena are you considering and why are they relevant and important for an ICER audience? 
  Objectives.  What research questions were you trying to answer? 
  Method.  What did you do to answer your research questions? 
  Findings.  What did you discover? Both positive and negative results should be summarized. 
  Implications.  What implications does your discovery have on prior and future research, and on the practice of computing education? 
  Not all papers may fit this structure, but if yours does, it will greatly help reviewers and future readers understand your paper’s research design and contribution.  
 What counts as plagiarism?   
 Read ACM’s policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  ; these criteria will be applied during review. In particular, attention will be paid to avoiding redundant publication.  
 Who should be an author on my paper?   
 ICER follows ACM’s Authorship Policy  and Publications Policy on the Withdrawal, Correction, Retraction, and Removal of Works from ACM Publications and ACM DL  . These state that any person listed as an author on a paper must (1) have made substantial contributions to the work, (2) have participated in drafting/revising the paper, (3) be aware that the paper has been submitted, and (4) agree to be held accountable for the content of the paper. Note that this policy allows enforcement of plagiarism sanctions, but it could impact people who work in large, collaborative research groups, and on postgraduate advisors who have not contributed directly to a paper.  
 Must submissions be in English?   
 At the moment, yes. Our reviewing community’s only lingua franca is English, and any other language would greatly limit the pool of expert reviewers to evaluate your work. We recognize that this is a challenging barrier for many authors globally, and that it greatly limits the diversity of voices in global discourse on computing education. Therefore, we wish to express our support of other computing education conferences around the world that you might consider submitting papers to. To mitigate this somewhat, papers will not be penalized for minor English spelling and grammar errors that can easily be corrected with minor revisions.

 The ICER Reviewing Process as outlined in this document is designed to support reaching the following goals:  
 Accept high quality papers 
  Give clear feedback to papers of insufficient quality 
  Evaluate papers consistently 
  Provide transparency in the review process 
  Embrace diversity of perspectives, but work in an inclusive, safe, collegial environment 
  Drive decisions by consensus among reviewers 
  Strive for manageable workload for PC members 
  Do our best on all of the above 
    2. Action Items  
 Prior to continuing to read this document, please do the following:  
 Read the call for papers at | https://icer2024.acm.org/track/icer-2024-papers | . This is the ground truth for scope and submission requirements. We expect you to account for these in your reviews. 
  Read the author guidelines at | https://icer2024.acm.org/track/icer-2024-papers#Author-Guidelines | . We expect your reviews and meta-reviews to be consistent with these guidelines. After having read this document, please block off a number of time slots in your calendar: 
  PC/Reviewers   
 Key dates:  
 Prior to March 29, 2024: Familiarize yourself with the ICER 2024 Reviewing Guidelines 
  March 22 – 29, 2024: Bid on papers and declare conflicts 
  March 29 – April 26, 2024: Review roughly 5 papers, depending on submission volume 
  April 26 – May 6, 2024: Asynchronously discuss papers with other reviewers and the Senior PC members assigned to your papers. 
  SPC/Meta-Reviewers   
 Key dates:  
 Prior to March 29, 2024: Familiarize yourself with the ICER 2024 Reviewing Guidelines 
  March 22 – 29, 2024: Bid on papers and declare conflicts 
  March 29 – April 26, 2024: Monitor the reviewing of 7-9 papers, depending on submission volume 
  April 26 – May 6, 2024: Asynchronously discuss papers with the reviewers assigned to those papers, prepare meta-review and recommendation. 
  Tuesday May 7, 2024: Complete submission of meta-reviews for all papers 
  Friday May 10 – Wednesday May 15, 2024: Skim the paper and read reviews for 1-2 submissions (which you did not handle) that will be discussed at the Senior PC meeting. 
  Wednesday May 15 – Friday May 17, 2024: Participate in synchronous, online SPC meetings to discuss and decide on papers without consensus and finalize your meta-reviews. Based on last year’s experiences, we are currently planning for up to four such virtual meetings to accommodate different time zones. As last year, we also expect that your participation in two of these meetings would be necessary and sufficient. Overall, expect it to be a four-hours commitment during this week, plus time to review your 1-2 assigned discussion papers. 
  Thursday May 30 – Thursday June 6, 2024: Re-check (a hopefully very, very small number of) minor revisions against the requests made in “conditional accept” decisions. 
  If you are new to reviewing in the Computing Education Research community, the following ITiCSE Working Group Report may serve as an introduction:  
 Petre M, Sanders K, McCartney R, Ahmadzadeh M, Connolly C, Hamouda S, Harrington B, Lumbroso J, Maguire J, Malmi L, McGill MM, Vahrenhold J. 2020. “Mapping the Landscape of Peer Review in Computing Education Research.” In ITiCSE-WGR ’20: Proceedings of the Working Group Reports on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, edited by Rφίling G, Krogstie B, 173-209. New York, NY: ACM Press. doi: 10.1145/3437800.3439207. 
    3. Submission System  
 ICER 2024 uses the HotCRP platform for its reviewing process. If you are unfamiliar with this, you will find a basic tutorial below. But first, make sure you can sign in, then bookmark it: http://icer2024.hotcrp.com  If you have trouble signing in, or you need help with anything, contact Rodrigo Duran rodrigo.duran@ifms.edu.br  and Juho Leinonen juho.2.leinonen@aalto.fi  , the ICER 2024 submission chairs, for help. Make sure that you can log in to HotCRP and that your name and other metadata is correct. Check that emails from HotCRP are not marked as spam and that HotCRP email notifications are enabled.  
   4. Roles in the Review Process  
 Program Committee (PC) Chairs   
 Each year there are two program committee co-chairs. The PC chairs are solicited by the ICER steering committee and appointed by the SIGCSE board to serve a two-year term. One new appointment is made each year so that in any given year there is always a continuing program chair from the prior year and a new program chair. Appointment criteria include prior attendance and publication at ICER, past service on the ICER Program Committee, research excellence in Computing Education, collaborative and organizational skills to share oversight of the program selection process. The ICER Steering Committee solicits and selects candidates for future PC chairs.  
 Program Committee (PC) Members / Reviewers   
 PC members write reviews of submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. The PC chairs invite and appoint the reviewers. The committee is sized so that each reviewer will serve for 5-6 paper submissions, or more depending on the size of the submissions pool. Each reviewer will serve a one-year term, with no limits on reappointment. Appointment criteria include expertise in relevant areas of computing education research and past reviewing experience in computing education research venues. Together, all reviewers constitute the program committee (PC). The PC chairs are responsible for inviting returning and new members of the PC, keeping in mind the various forms of diversity that are present at ICER.  
 Senior Program Committee Members (SPC) / Meta-Reviewers   
 SPC members review the PC members’ reviews, ensuring that the review content is constructive and aligned with the review criteria, as well as summarizing reviews and making recommendations for a paper’s acceptance and rejection. They also moderate discussions about each paper and provide feedback on reviews if necessary, asking reviewers to improve the quality of reviews. Finally, they participate in a synchronous SPC meeting to make final recommendations about each paper, and review authors’ minor revisions. The PC chairs invite and appoint Senior PC members, with the approval of the steering committee, again, keeping in mind the various forms of diversity that are present at ICER. Each Senior PC member can be appointed for up to three years in a row; after a hiatus of at least one year, preferably two years, re-appointment is possible. The committee is sized so that each meta-reviewer will handle 8-10 papers, depending on the submission pool.  
   5. Principles Behind ICER Reviewing  
 The ICER review process is designed to work towards these goals:  
 Maximize the alignment between a paper and expertise required to review it. 
  Minimize conflicts of interests and promoting trust in the process. 
  Maximize our community’s ability to make excellent, rigorous, trustworthy contributions to the science of computing education. 
  The call for papers and author guide should make this clear, but ICER is broadly scoped. The conference publishes research on teaching and learning of computer science content that happens in any context. In consequence, reviewers should not downgrade papers for being about a topic they personally perceive to be less important to computing education. If the work is sufficiently ready for publication and reviewers believe it is of interest to some part of the computing education community, it should be published such that the community can decide its importance over time.  
   6. Conflicts of Interest  
 ICER takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the ICER conference is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  
 The individual is a co-author of the paper 
  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper 
  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that he or she can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. 
  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  
 The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that track. 
  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. 
  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (SPC members) are allowed to submit to any track. 
  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  
   7. The Reviewing Process  
 Step 1: Authors Submit Abstracts   
 Authors will submit a title and abstract one week prior to assigning papers. Authors are allowed to revise their title and abstract before the full paper submission deadline.  
 Step 2: Reviewers and Meta-Reviewers Bid for Papers   
 Reviewers and meta-reviewers will be asked to bid on papers for which they have sufficient expertise (in both phenomena and methods) and then the PC chairs will assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is not to express interest in papers you want to read. It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes.  
 Specify all of your conflicts of interest. Conflicts are any situation where you have any connection with a submission that is in tension with your role as an independent reviewer (you advised an author, you have collaborated with an author, you are at the same institution, you are close friends, etc.). After declaring conflicts, you will be excluded from all future evaluation, discussion, and decisions of that paper. Program chairs and submissions chairs will also specify conflicts of interest at this time. 
  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. Sufficient expertise includes knowledge of research methods used and prior research on the phenomena. Practical knowledge of a topic is helpful, but insufficient. 
  Do not bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you strongly oppose. That precludes authors from being fairly reviewed by authors with negative bias; see below for positive biases and how to control for them. 
  Step 3: Authors Submit Papers   
 Submissions are due one week after the abstracts are due. As you read in the submission instructions ( https://icer2024.acm.org/track/icer-2024-papers#Submission-Instructions  ), submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous that a reader cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of ICER’s anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. (Most guesses will be wrong anyway.) See the submission instructions for what constitutes sufficient anonymization. When in doubt, write the PC chairs for clarity at pc-chairs@icer.acm.org  .  
 Step 4: PC Chairs Decide on Desk-Rejects   
 The PC chairs, with the help of the submissions chairs, will review each submission for papers that violate anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk rejected papers will be notified immediately. The PC chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during review that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the chairs before you write a review; the PC chairs will make the final judgement about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 PC chairs with conflicts are excluded from deciding on desk rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other program chair.  
 Step 5: PC Chairs Assign Reviewers   
 Based on the bids and their judgement, the PC chairs will collaboratively assign at least three reviewers (PC members) and one meta-reviewer (SPC member) for each submission. The PC chairs will be advised by HotCRP’s assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. Remember, for these assignments to be fair and good, your bids should only be based on your expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding on a paper. The chairs will review the algorithm’s assignments to identify potential misalignments with expertise. Managing Conflicts of Interest PC chairs with conflicts are excluded from assigning reviewers to any papers for which they have a conflict. Assignments in HotCRP can only be made by a PC chair without a conflict.  
 Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   
 Assigned reviewers submit their anonymous reviews through HotCRP by the review deadline, evaluating each of their papers against the review criteria (see Review Criteria). The time allocated for reviews is four weeks in which 5-6 reviews need to be written. Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, there cannot be any extensions.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers they are conflicted on during this process.  
 Step 6b: Meta-Reviewers and PC Chairs Monitor Progress   
 Meta-reviewers and PC chairs will periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made.  
 Step 7: Reviewers and Meta-Reviewers Discuss Reviews   
 After the reviewing period, the assigned meta-reviewer asks the reviewers to read the other reviewers’ reviews and begin a discussion about any disagreements that arise. All reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). 
  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. 
  Use the review criteria to guide your discussions. 
  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. 
  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. 
  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgements. 
  If your judgement does shift, update your review to reflect your new views. There is no need to indicate to the authors that you changed your review but do leave a comment for the other reviewers and the meta-reviewer indicating what you changed and why (HotCRP does not track changes). Discussing a paper is not about who wins or who is right. It is about how, in the light of all information, a group of reviewers can find the best decision on a paper. All reviewers (and the authors!) have their unique perspective and competence. It is perfectly normal that they may have seen things you have not, just as you may have seen things they have not. The important thing is to accept that the group will see more than the individual. Therefore, you can always (and are encouraged to!) shift your stance in light of the extra knowledge.  
 PC chairs will periodically check in. If you have configured HotCRP notifications correctly, you will be notified as soon as new information (another review or a new discussion item) about your paper comes in. It is important that you react to these, and as soon as possible. Do not let your colleagues wait for days when all that is needed is some short statement from your side.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the discussions of the papers they are conflicted on during this process.  
 Step 8: Meta-Reviewers Write Meta-Reviews   
 After the discussion phase, meta-reviewers use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the work to write a meta-review and recommendation. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the paper, in light of the review criteria, and explain how these led to the decision. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to ICER standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient. There are four possible meta-review recommendations: reject, discuss, conditional accept, and accept. The recommendation needs to be entered in the meta-review.  
 Reject. Ensure that the meta-review constructively summarizes the reviews and the rationale for rejection. The PC chairs will review all meta-reviews to ensure that reviews are constructive, and may request meta-reviewers to revise their meta-reviews as necessary. The PC chairs will make the final rejection decision based on the meta-review rationale; if necessary, this paper will be discussed at the SPC meeting. 
  Discuss. Ensure that the meta-review summarizes the open questions that need to be resolved at the SPC meeting discussion, where the paper will either be recommended as reject, conditional accept, or accept. Papers marked discussed will be scheduled for discussion at the SPC meeting. All papers for which the opinion of the meta-reviewer and the majority of reviewer recommendations do not align should be marked “discuss” as well. 
  Conditional Accept. Ensure that the meta-review explicitly and clearly states the conditions that must be met with minor revisions before the paper can be accepted. To accept with conditions, the conditions must be feasible to make within the one-week revision period, so they must be minor. The PC chairs will make the final decision on whether the requested revisions are minor enough to warrant conditional acceptance; if necessary, this paper will be discussed at the SPC meeting. 
  Accept. These papers will be accepted, assuming authors deanonymize the paper and meet the final version deadline. For technical reasons, “accept” recommendations are recorded internally as “conditional accept” recommendations that do not state any conditions for acceptance other than submitting the final version. The PC chairs will make the final acceptance decision based on the meta-review rationale; if necessary, this paper will be discussed at the SPC meeting. 
  Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the recommendations or meta-reviews of the papers they are conflicted on during this process.  
 Step 9: PC Chairs and Meta-Reviewers Discuss Papers   
 The PC chairs will host synchronous SPC meetings with all available meta-reviewers (SPC members) to discuss and decide on all “discuss” and “conditional accept” papers. Before this meeting, a second meta-reviewer will be assigned to each such paper, ensuring that there are at least two meta-reviewers to facilitate discussion. Each meta-reviewer assigned to a paper should come prepared to present the paper, its reviews, and the HotCRP discussion. Each meta-reviewer’s job is to present their recommendation, and/or if they requested discussion, present the uncertainty that prevents them from making one. All meta-reviewers who are available to attend a SPC meeting session should, at a minimum, skim each of the papers to be discussed and their reviews (excluding those for which they are conflicted), so they are familiar with the papers and their reviews prior to the discussions. At the meeting, the goal is to collectively reach consensus, rather than relying on the PC chairs alone to make final decisions. Papers may move from “discuss” to either “reject”, “conditional accept”, or “accept”; if there are conditions, they must be approved by a majority of the non-conflicted SPC and PC chairs at the discussion. After a decision is made in each case, the original SPC member will add a summary of the discussion at the end of their meta-review, explaining the rationale for the final decision, as well as any conditions for acceptance, and updating the recommendation tag in HotCRP.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Meta-reviewers conflicted on a paper will not be assigned as a second reader. Any meta-reviewer or PC chair conflicted on a paper will be excluded from the paper’s discussion, returning after the discussion is over.  
 Step 10: PC Chair Review   
 Before announcing decisions, the non-conflicted PC chairs will review all meta-reviews to ensure as much clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 PC chairs cannot change the outcome of an accept or reject decision after the SPC meeting.  
 Step 11: Notifications   
 After the SPC meeting, the PC chairs will notify all authors of the decisions about their papers; these notification will be via email through HotCRP. Papers that are (unconditionally) accepted will be encouraged to make any changes that may have been suggested but not required; papers that are conditionally accepted will be reminded of the revision evaluation deadline.  
 Step 12: Authors of Conditionally Accepted Papers Revise their Papers   
 Authors of conditionally accepted papers have one week to incorporate the requested revisions and to submit their final versions for review by the assigned meta-reviewer.  
 Step 13: Meta-Reviewers Check Revised Papers   
 Meta-reviewers will check the revised papers against the required revisions. Based on the outcome of this, they will change their recommendation to either “accept” or “reject” and will update their meta-reviews to reflect this.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the recommendations or meta-reviews of the papers they are conflicted on during this process.  
 Step 14: Notifications   
 PC chairs will sanity-check all comments on those papers for which revisions were submitted. Conditionally accepted papers for which not revisions were received will be marked as “reject”. PC chairs then finalize decisions. After this review, all recommendations will be converted to official accept or reject decisions in HotCRP and authors will be notified of these final decisions via email sent through HotCRP. Authors will then have one week to submit to ACM TAPS for final publication.  
 Managing Conflicts of Interest   
 Reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the recommendations or meta-reviews of the papers they are conflicted on during this process. PC chairs with conflicts cannot see or edit any final decision on these papers.  
   8. Review Criteria  
 ICER currently evaluates papers against the following reviewing criteria, as independently as possible. These have been carefully chosen to be inclusive to many phenomena, epistemologies, and contribution types.  
 Criterion A: The submission is grounded in relevant prior work and leverages available theory when appropriate. 
  Criterion B: The submission describes its methods and/or innovations sufficiently for others to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how an innovation works. 
  Criterion C: The submission’s methods and/or innovations soundly address its research questions. 
  Criterion D: The submission advances knowledge of computing education by addressing (possibly novel) questions that are of interest to the computing education community. 
  Criterion E: Discussion of results clearly summarizes the submission’s contributions beyond prior work and its implications for research and practice. 
  Criterion F: The submission is written clearly enough to publish. 
  To be published at ICER, papers should be positively evaluated on all of these. The summary of this is another criterion:  
 Summary: Based on the criteria above, this paper should be published at ICER. 
  Below, we discuss each criterion in turn.  
   Criterion A: The submission is grounded in relevant prior work and leverages available theory when appropriate.  
 Papers should draw on relevant prior work and theories, and explicitly show how they are tied to the questions addressed. After reading the paper, one should feel more informed about prior literature and how that literature is related to the paper’s contributions. Such coverage of related work might come before a work’s contributions, or it might come after (e.g, connecting a new theory derived from observations to prior work. Note that not all types of research will have relevant theory to discuss, nor do all contribution types need theory to make significant advances. For example, a surprisingly robust but unexplained correlation might be an important discovery that later work could develop theory to explain. Reviewers should identify related work the authors might have missed and include pointers. Missing a paper that is relevant, but would not dramatically change the paper, is not sufficient grounds for rejecting a paper. Such citations can be added upon reviewers’ request prior to publication. Instead, criticism in reviews that leads to downgrading a paper should focus on missing prior work or theories that would significantly alter research questions, analysis, or interpretation of results.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since prior work and theories needs to be covered sufficiently and in a meaningful way but not necessarily completely, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from downgrading work based on missing one or two peripherally related papers. Just note them, helping the authors to broaden their citations. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on not citing the reviewer’s own work, unless it really is objectively highly relevant. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on where in a paper they address prior work. Sometimes a dedicated section is appropriate, sometimes it is not. Sometimes prior work is better addressed at the end of a paper, not at the beginning. 
  Make sure to critically note if work simply lists papers without meaningfully addressing their relevance to the paper’s questions or innovations. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on making discoveries inconsistent with theory. The point of empirical work is to test and refine theories, not conform to them. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on not building upon theory when there is no sufficient theory available that can be pointed out in the review. Conversely, if there is a missing and relevant theory, it should be named. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on not using the reviewer’s interpretation of a theory. Many theories have multiple competing interpretations and multiple distinct facets that can be seen from multiple perspectives. 
    Criterion B: The submission describes its methods and/or innovations sufficiently for others to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how an innovation works.  
 An ICER paper should be self-contained in the sense that readers should be able to understand most of the key details about how the authors conducted their work or made their innovation possible. This is key for replication and meta-analysis of studies that come from positivist or post-positivist epistemologies. For interpretivist works, it is also key for what Checkland and Howell called “recoverability” (See Tracy et al. 2010 for a detailed overview for evaluating qualitative work). Reviews thus should focus on omissions of research process or innovation details that would significantly alter your judgment of the paper’s validity.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since ICER papers have to adhere to a word count limit and since there are always more details a paper can describe about methods, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from downgrading work based on not describing every detail. 
  Refrain from asking authors to write substantially new method details unless you can identify content for them to cut, or there is space to add those details within the length restrictions. 
  Refrain from asking authors of theory contributions for a traditional methods section; such contributions do not require them, as they are not empirical in nature. 
  Feel free to ask authors for minor revisions that would support replication or meta-analysis for positivist or post-positivist works, and recoverability for interpretivist works using qualitative methods. 
    Criterion C: The submission’s methods and/or innovations soundly address its research questions.  
 The paper should answer the questions it poses, and it should do so with rigor, broadly construed. This is the single most important difference between research papers and other kinds of knowledge sharing in computing education (e.g., experience reports), and the source of certainty researchers can offer. Note that soundness is relative to claims. For example, if a paper claims to have provided evidence of causality, but its methods did not do that, that would be grounds for critique. But if a paper only claimed to have found a correlation, and that correlation is a notable discovery that future work could explain, downgrading it for not demonstrating causality would be inappropriate.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since soundness is relative to claims and methods, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from applying criteria for quantitative methods to qualitative methods (e.g., critiquing a case study for a “small N” makes no sense; that is the point of a case study). 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on a lack of a statistically significant difference if the study demonstrates sufficient power to detect a difference. A lack of difference can be discovery, too. 
  Refrain from asking for the paper to do more than it claims if the demonstrated claims are sufficiently publishable (e.g., “I would publish this if it had also demonstrated knowledge transfer”). 
  Refrain from relying on inexpert, anecdotal judgments (e.g., “I don’t know much about this but I played with it once and it didn’t work”). 
  Refrain from assuming that because a method has not been used in computing education literature that it is not standard somewhere else. The field draws upon methods from many communities. Look for evidence that the method is used elsewhere. 
    Criterion D: The submission advances knowledge of computing education by addressing (possibly novel) questions that are of interest to the computing education community.  
 A paper can meet the previous criteria and still fail to advance what we know about the phenomena. It is up to the authors to convince you that the discoveries advance our knowledge in some way, e.g., by confirming uncertain prior work, adding a significant new idea, or making progress on a long-standing open question. Secondarily, there should be someone who might find the discovery interesting. It does not have to be interesting to a particular reviewer, and a particular reviewer does not have to be absolutely confident that an audience exists. As the PC cannot possibly reflect the broader audience of all readers, a probable audience is sufficient for publication.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since advances can come in many forms, there are many criticisms that are inappropriate in isolation (if, however, many of these apply, they may justify rejection), and, thus, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from downgrading work because another, single paper was already published on the topic. Discoveries accumulate over many papers, not just one. 
  Refrain from downgrading work that contributes a really new idea for not yet having everything figured out about it. Again, new discoveries may require multiple papers. 
  Refrain from downgrading work because the results do not appear generalizable or were only obtained at a specific institution. Many papers explicitly discuss such limitations and possible remedies. Also, generalizability takes time, and, by their very nature, some qualitative methods do not lead to generalizable results. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on “only” being a replication. Replications, if done with diligence, are important. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on investigating phenomena you personally do not like (e.g., “I hate object-oriented languages, this work does not matter”). 
    Criterion E: Discussion of results clearly summarizes the submission’s contributions beyond prior work and its implications for research and practice.  
 It is the authors’ responsibility to help interpret the significance of a paper’s discoveries. If it makes significant advances, but does not explain what those advances are and why they matter, the paper is not ready for publication. That said, it is perfectly fine if you disagree with the paper’s interpretations or implications. Readers will vary on what they think a discovery means or what impact it might have on the world. All that is necessary is that the work presents some reasonably sound discussion of one possible set of interpretations.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Because there is no single “right” interpretation or discussion of implications, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following  
 Refrain from downgrading work because you do not think the idea would work in your institution. 
  Refrain from downgrading work because you think that the impact is limited. Check the discussion of limitations and threats to validity and evaluate the paper with respect to the claims made. 
  Make sure to critically note if work makes interpretations that are not grounded in evidence or proposes implications that are not grounded in evidence. 
    Criterion F: The submission is written clearly enough to publish.  
 Papers need to be clear and concise, both to be comprehensible to diverse audiences, but also to ensure the community is not overburdened by verboseness. We recognize that not all authors are fluent English writers; if, however, the paper requires significant editing to be comprehensible to fluent English readers, or it is unnecessarily verbose, it is not yet ready for publication.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Since submissions should be clear enough, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from downgrading work based on having easily fixed spelling and grammar issues. 
  Refrain from downgrading a sufficiently clear paper because it could be clearer. All writing can be clearer in some way. 
  Refrain from downgrading work based on not using all of the available word count. It is okay if a paper is short but significant. 
  Refrain from asking for more detail unless you are certain there is space or - if there is not space - you can provide concrete suggestions for what to cut. 
    Summary: Based on the criteria above, this paper should be published at ICER.  
 Based on all of the previous criteria, decide how strongly you believe the paper should be accepted or rejected, assuming authors make any modest, straightforward minor revisions you and other reviewers request before publication. Papers that meet all of the criteria should be strongly accepted (though this does not imply that they are perfect). Papers that fail to meet most of the criteria should be strongly rejected. Each paper should be reviewed independently of others, as if it were a standalone journal submission. There are no conference presentation “slots”; there is no target acceptance rate. Neither should be a factor in reviewing individual submissions.  
 Guidelines for (Meta-)Reviewers   
 Because each paper should be judged on its own, (meta-)reviewers are asked to do the following:  
 Refrain from recommending to accept a paper because it was the best in your set. It is possible that none of your papers sufficiently meet the criteria. 
  Refrain from recommending to reject a paper because it should not take up a “slot”. The PC chairs will devise a program for however many papers sufficiently meet the criteria, whether that is 5 or 50. There is no need to preemptively design the program through your review; focus on the criteria. 
    9. Award Recommendations  
 On the review form, reviewers may signal to the meta-reviewer and PC chairs that they believe the submission should be considered for a best paper award. Selecting this option in the review form is visible to the other (meta-)reviewers as part of your review, but it is not disclosed to the authors. Reviewers should recognize papers that best illustrate the highest standards of computing education research, taking into account the quality of its questions asked, methodology, analysis, writing, and contribution to the field. This includes papers that meet all of the review criteria in exemplary ways (e.g., research that was particularly well designed, executed, and communicated), or papers that meet specific review criteria in exemplary ways (e.g., discoveries are particularly significant or sound). The meta-review form for each paper includes an option to officially nominate a paper to the Awards Committee for the best-paper award. Reviewers may flag papers for award consideration during review, but meta-reviewers are ultimately responsible for nominating papers for the best paper award. Each meta-reviewer may nominate at most two papers for the best paper award. Nominated papers may or may not have been flagged by one or more reviewers. Nominations should be recorded in HotCRP and be accompanied by a paragraph outlining the rationale for nomination. NOTE: Whether a paper has been nominated and the accompanying rationale are not disclosed to the authors as part of the meta-review.  
  Meta-reviewers are encouraged to review and finalize their nominations at the conclusion of the SPC meeting to allow for possible calibration. Once paper decisions have been sent, the submission chair will make PDFs and the corresponding rationales for all nominated papers available to the Awards Chair. Additionally, a list of all meta-reviewers that have handled any nominated paper or have one or more conflicts of interest with any nominated paper will be disclosed to the Awards Chair, as those members are not eligible to serve on the Awards Committee.  
   10. Possible Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification  
 If after reading a submission, you suspect that it has in some way plagiarized from some other source, do the following:  
 Read the | ACM guidelines on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification | . 
  If you think there is a potential issue, write the PC chairs at | pc-chairs@icer.acm.org | to escalate the potential violation, and share any information you have about the case. Authors are required to disclose any potentially overlapping work to the PC chairs upon submission. 
  The chairs will investigate and decide as necessary prior to the acceptance notification deadline. You should not mark the paper for rejection based on suspected plagiarism. Mark it based on the paper as it stands, while the PC chairs investigate.  
   11. Practical Suggestions for Writing Reviews  
 The following suggestions may be helpful when reviewing papers:  
 Before reading, remind yourself of the preceding reviewing criteria. 
  Read the paper, and as you do, note positive and negative aspects for each of the preceding reviewing criteria. 
  Use your notes to outline a review organized by the seven criteria, so authors can understand your judgments for each criterion. 
  Draft your review based on your outline. 
  Edit your review, making it as constructive and clear as possible. Even a very negative review should be respectful to the author(s), helping to educate them. Avoid comments about the author(s) themselves; focus on the document. 
  Based on your review, choose scores for each of the criteria. 
  Based on your review and scores, choose a recommendation score and decide whether to recommend the paper for consideration for a best paper award. 
  Thank you very much for reading this document and thank you very much for being part of the ICER reviewing process. Do not hesitate to email the Program Co-Chairs at pc-chairs@icer.acm.org  if you have any questions.

 Find out more      

 History  
 ICFCA, CLA and ICCS are three highly relevant conferences in the field of formal concept analysis (FCA) and related areas. All three conferences contribute significantly to advancing the understanding and application of formal concept analysis. In particular:  

 ICFCA stands for the International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis . This conference serves as a platform for researchers working on formal concept analysis to present their latest findings, exchange ideas, and discuss advancements in the field. 
  CLA refers to Concept Lattices and Their Applications . This conference series primarily focuses on the theoretical foundations, algorithms, and applications of formal concept analysis and concept lattices. 
  ICCS stands for the International Conference on Conceptual Structures . While not exclusively focused on formal concept analysis, ICCS explores conceptual structures and related theories, including formal concept analysis, ontology, knowledge representation, and semantic technologies. 

 On October 2023, representatives of the three conferences approved the merging of the three conferences  ICFCA,   CLA and ICCS   and creating a new joint event, the  International Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge Structures (CONCEPTS).   This merger aimed to create a unified and comprehensive forum for researchers, academics, and professionals from various disciplines interested in formal concept analysis, conceptual structures, and related fields to exchange ideas, present their research, and discuss the latest advancements in these areas. For this purpose, the overall organization of CONCEPTS will follow the existing rules and traditions of the three conferences.

  # Overview  
   
  Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980's from attempts to restructure lattice theory in order to promote better communication between lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since its early years, Formal Concept Analysis has developed into a research field in its own right with a thriving theoretical community and a rapidly expanding range of applications in information and knowledge processing including visualization, data analysis (mining) and knowledge management and discovery.  
   
  The ICFCA conference series aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working on theoretical or applied aspects of Formal Concept Analysis within major related areas such as Mathematics and Computer and Information Sciences and their diverse applications to fields like Software Engineering, Linguistics, Life and Social Sciences, etc.  
   
  All accepted submissions will be refereed, and the conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series.  
   
  # Topics  
   
  Main topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
   
  ## Fundamental aspects of FCA  
   
  - FCA theory  
  - Lattice theory  
  - Lattice drawing  
  - Philosophical foundations  
  - Algorithms and complexity theory  
   
  ## Bridging FCA to information sciences and artificial intelligence  
   
  - FCA and logic, e.g., semantic web, description logics  
  - FCA and conceptual structures, e.g., concept graphs, knowledge spaces  
  - FCA and data analysis, e.g., hierarchical classification, data organization  
  - FCA and data mining, e.g., pattern mining  
  - FCA and information retrieval, e.g. exploratory search, navigation, querying  
  - FCA and machine learning, e.g., learning with hypothesis, feature selection  
  - FCA and database theory, e.g., dependencies, rules, data cubes  
  - FCA and software engineering  
  - FCA and morphological mathematics  
   
  ## Understanding, modelling real-world data and phenomena with FCA  
   
  - Analysis of "big data" with FCA, e.g., sampling, parallel computing  
  - Analysis of social networks and their dynamics  
  - Applications for scientific data analysis, e.g., in biology or health care  
  - Applications for sensors data and user interactions traces  
  - Other FCA applications

 About  
 ICFEC 2025  

 The 9th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2025) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in the fields of fog and edge computing. ICFEC 2025 will take place in conjunction with The 25th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2025).  
  
  Fog and edge computing have received much attention by both the research community and the industry in recent years, and are today seen as an alternative to the utilization of cloud-based computational resources. Especially, this is the case in scenarios where large amounts of data are produced in distributed settings, e.g., in the Internet of Things (IoT), where data needs to be processed in (near) real time, or where suboptimal network connectivity hampers the upload of very large amounts of data to the cloud. Use cases for fog and edge computing range from smart factories over smart grids to autonomous vehicles, to name just some examples.  
  
  While tremendous progress has already been made in the research fields of fog and edge computing, there are still numerous challenges which need to be solved. New abstractions and extensions to current programming and storage models are necessary to allow developers to design novel applications that can benefit from massively distributed fog and edge systems. Addressing security, privacy, and trust is of paramount importance while managing the resources and context of mobile, transient and hardware-constrained resources. Fog and edge computing can also help to process very large amounts of data, both for batch processing and data streams. The integration of novel communication protocols and communication patterns with fog and edge computing also brings both new opportunities and unique challenges. Recently, the utilization of fog and edge resources in order to realize distributed machine learning in the form of federated learning has also gained much traction, since it allows to learn from local data without sharing raw data with any centralized entity.  

 Call for Papers  
 Call for Papers: TBD  

 The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice over systems research and emerging domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems that cover different parts of the cloud-edge compute continuum. This covers different computing models, including mist computing, edge computing, multi-access edge computing, fog computing, and mobile cloud computing. Some representative topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 Who am I (short bio)   
 I received my Ph.D. from Grenoble Institute of Technologies in September 2006 and my M.S. degree from the University of Grenoble in 2003. During my PhD, I suggested a new way to handle I/O requests in multi-application clusters. This proposal led to the aIOLi project, an I/O scheduler framework for HPC file systems. In the meantime, I worked on the NFSp project, a non intrusive implementation of a parallel NFS server. Until these websites will be shutdown, you should find further details (PhD thesis, publications, code documentations) on the aIOLi  's and NFSp  's sites.  
  Between 2006 and 2008, I held a postdoc position at Inria in the framework of the XtreemOS project  EU IP project. During this position, I had been in charge of designing and developing kDFS  (a kernel Distributed File System).  
  I joined the "ASCOLA Research Group  at the Ecole des Mines de Nantes on September 2008 where I worked on distributed cloud computing challenges (see Beyond the Clouds  initiative as well as the FEMDC Working Group  of the OpenStack community). These activities led in part to the creation of the STACK Research Group that I have been leading since November 2017.

 Research Interest   
 Distributed Computing (Cloud/Fog/Edge) 
  Resource management systems 
  (Distributed) Operating Systems 
  Distributed File Systems/Key Value Stores 
  Virtualizations 
  More precisely I investigate the interest of recent programming models (such as event or component programming) in the design of new systems to help administrators and DevOps manage large-scale geo-distributed infrastructures/applications. I'm currently working on two particular challenges leveraging locality as a key point of the design:  
 Proposing new storage layers to reduce the impact of the network at WAN level. 
  Investigating new approaches to deal with geo-distribution aspects without increasing the complexity of the business logic of an application.

 ICFCA 2023, International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis  
   
 July 17-21, 2023, Kassel (Germany)  
 Aims  
 The ICFCA conference series is the major biennial event of the Formal Concept Analysis research community. The 17th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis, ICFCA 2023, aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on both theoretical and practical aspects of Formal Concept Analysis, as well as its applications in various application fields like data mining, machine learning, software engineering, semantic web, social and environmental sciences.  
 Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980’s from attempts to restructure lattice theory in order to promote better communication between lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since its early years, Formal Concept Analysis has developed into a research field in its own right with a thriving theoretical community and a rapidly expanding range of applications in information and knowledge processing including visualization, data analysis (mining) and knowledge management and discovery.  
 ICFCA 2023 will be hosted at the University of Kassel. It will be a hybrid conference with a strong emphasis on on-site interaction.

 Abstract | — | 2 
  
 ICCS is co-organised with the Workshops on Computational Science, a set of thematic satellite events that focus on particular aspects of computational science. You can submit your paper to either the Main Conference or any of the Workshops via the same EasyChair link. You can also choose to submit a Full/Short Paper  or an Abstract  . Please see the table above for the differences between each submission type.  
 Do also note that:   
  1.  ICCS and WCS (Workshops on Computational Science) papers will be published in separate proceedings, that is, there will be a LNCS publication for the Main Conference, and a different LNCS publication for the Workshops. But both ICCS and WCS will be published by LNCS, and indexed in the same way.  
  2.  The only difference between Full and Short papers is the number of accepted pages. They are otherwise published and indexed in the exact same way.  
 While we encourage full paper submissions, the “ Abstract Only  ” option caters to researchers who can only publish in specific journals or work for companies in circumstances such that they cannot publish at all, but still want to present their work and discuss it with their peers at ICCS. In the “Abstract Only” option, a short abstract is included in the conference program, but not in LNCS.  
 After the conference, the best papers will be invited for a special issue of the Journal of Computational Science  (Impact Factor: 3.1)  
  Instructions for Authors  
 The manuscripts of up to 15 pages  , written in English  and formatted according to the Springer LNCS templates, should be submitted electronically via EasyChair.  .  
 The most recent versions of the Templates  are available for download from this link  .  
  The LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates  are also available in the scientific authoring platform Overleaf.  
  Please also make sure to follow Springer’s authors’ guidelines  , as well as Springer’s Book Authors’ Code of Conduct  .  
 Papers must be based on unpublished original work and must be submitted to ICCS only. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper.   
 Do also note that ICCS lays crucial emphasis on the explicit relevance of submitted contributions to Computational Science  . All submissions to the conference, whether to the main conference or to the workshops, will be evaluated for this relevance (through a mandatory field in the submission form). Papers that are more relevant to specialized conferences on very specific topics will be desk-rejected before the standard review process begins.  
 To promote open science and to facilitate reproducibility, ICCS encourages data and code sharing. Please keep this in mind when submitting your papers.  
 Deadlines  for draft paper submission, notification of acceptance, camera-ready paper submission and registration may be found in the Important Dates  section.  
 For the camera-ready version, please note that:   
 ICCS authors interested in | open access for their papers (open choice) | have the possibility to do so. When you submit your camera-ready paper, if you intend to make it open access, | contact us | and we will tell you how to proceed. 
  Springer encourages authors to include their | ORCIDs | in their papers. 
  Springer is now offering the inclusion of | embedded videos | in proceedings papers.

 ICFCA 2021 will be held as a virtual event. Registration is free, but required on this website. The conference will use Zoom. Connexion links will be sent daily to registered persons.  

 Aims  
 The ICFCA conference series is the major biannual event of the Formal Concept Analysis research community. The 16th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis, ICFCA 2021, aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on both theoretical and practical aspects of Formal Concept Analysis, as well as its applications in various application fields like data mining, machine learning, software engineering, semantic web, social and environmental sciences.  
 Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980’s from attempts to restructure lattice theory in order to promote better communication between lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since its early years, Formal Concept Analysis has developed into a research field in its own right with a thriving theoretical community and a rapidly expanding range of applications in information and knowledge processing including visualization, data analysis (mining) and knowledge management and discovery.  
 ICFCA 2021 will be hosted by Université de Strasbourg.  

 Warning  
 We have been made aware of scam attempts concerning the registration and accommodation for the conference for authors and invited speakers: a false program committee asks to pay quickly by paypal for registration and/or accommodation. We recommend to be careful about registration instructions that are not written on the conference website.

 Simulations of Flow and Transport: Modeling, Algorithms and Computation – SOFTMAC  
 Web Address:  Coming soon.   
 Contact:  Shuyu Sun  , King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia, email    
 Description:  Modeling of flow and transport is an essential component of many scientific and engineering applications, with increased interests in recent years. Application areas vary widely, and include groundwater contamination, carbon sequestration, air pollution, petroleum exploration and recovery, weather prediction, drug delivery, material design, chemical separation processes, biological processes, and many others. However, accurate mathematical and numerical simulation of flow and transport remains a challenging topic from many aspects of physical modeling, numerical analysis and scientific computation. Mathematical models are usually expressed via nonlinear systems of partial differential equations, with possibly rough and discontinuous coefficients, whose solutions are often singular and discontinuous. An important step of a numerical solution procedure is to apply advanced discretization methods (e.g. finite elements, finite volumes, and finite differences) to the governing equations. Local mass conservation and compatibility of numerical schemes are often necessary to obtain physical meaningful solutions. Another important solution step is the design of fast and accurate solvers for the large-scale linear and nonlinear algebraic equation systems that result from discretization. Solution techniques of interest include multiscale algorithms, mesh adaptation, parallel algorithms and implementation, efficient splitting or decomposition schemes, and others.  
  The international workshop on “Simulations of Flow and Transport: Modeling, Algorithms and Computation” (SOFTMAC) has been held 13 years since 2011 within the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS). The aim of this symposium is to bring together researchers in the aforementioned field to highlight the current developments both in theory and methods, to exchange the latest research ideas, and to promote further collaborations in the community. We invite original research articles describing the recent advances in mathematical modeling, computer simulation, numerical analysis, and other computational aspects of flow and transport phenomena of flow and transport.  
  Potential topics include, but are not limited to: advanced numerical methods for the simulation of subsurface and surface flow and transport, and associated aspects such as discretization, gridding, upscaling, multiscale algorithms, optimization, data assimilation, uncertainty assessment, and high performance parallel and grid computing; 
  spatial discretization schemes based on advanced finite element, finite volume, and finite different methods; schemes that preserve local mass conservation (such as mixed finite element methods and discontinuous Galerkin methods) are of particular interest; 
  decomposition methods for improved efficiency and accuracy in treating flow and transport problems; decomposition methods for nonlinear differential equations and dynamical systems arising in flow and transport; temporal discretization schemes for flow and transport; 
  a-priori and a-posteriori error estimates in discretizations and decompositions; numerical convergence study; adaptive algorithms and implementation; 
  modeling and simulation of single-phase and multi-phase flow in porous media or in free space, and its applications to earth sciences and engineering; 
  modeling and simulation of subsurface and surface transport and geochemistry, and its application to environmental sciences and engineering; 
  computational thermodynamics of fluids, especially hydrocarbon and other oil reservoir fluids, and its interaction with flow and transport; 
  (8) computational modeling of flow and transport in other fields, such as geological flow/transport in crust and mantle, material flow in supply chain networks, separation processes in chemical engineering, information flow, biotransport, and intracellular protein trafficking, will also be considered.

 Solving Problems with Uncertainty – SPU  
 Web Address:  https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/events/solving-problems-with-uncertainty/    
 Contact:  Vassil Alexandrov  STFC Hartree Centre, United Kingdom, email    
 Description:  Problems with uncertainty need to be tackled in an increasing variety of areas, from physics, chemistry, engineering, computational biology and environmental sciences to decision making in economics and social sciences. Uncertainty is unavoidable in almost all systems analysis, risk analysis, decision making and modelling and simulation. How uncertainty is handled and quantified shapes the integrity of the analysis, and the correctness and credibility of the solution and the results is especially important when tackling complex systems.  
  With exascale computing now being a reality, and the advances of big data analytics and scalable AI, larger and larger problems – often requiring hybrid approaches – have to be solved in a systematic way at scale. The problem of solving such problems with uncertainties and quantifying the uncertainties becomes even more important, especially in the case of complex systems, due to the variety and scale of uncertainties in such problems.  
  The focus of the workshop will be on methods and algorithms for solving problems with uncertainties, stochastic methods and algorithms for solving problems with uncertainties, methods and algorithms for quantifying uncertainties such as dealing with data input and missing data, sensitivity analysis (local and global), dealing with model inadequacy, model validation and averaging, software fault-tolerance and resilience and more.

 Title:  Formal Specification of Autonomy Features with ARE and KnowLang  
 Abstract:   
 Autonomous systems, such as autonomous vehicles, extend upstream the regular software-intensive systems with special autonomy features. The identification of such features is not necessarily an easy task. Sometimes, those can be explicitly stated by stakeholders or in preliminary material available to requirements engineers. Often though, they are implicit, so a process of formal specification intended to capture the autonomy features has to be undertaken. This paper elaborates on a methodology for capturing and specification of autonomy features where autonomy requirements are captured with ARE (Autonomy Requirements Engineering) and then are specified with KnowLang. a framework for knowledge representation and reasoning. In this approach, autonomy features are detected as special self-* objectives backed up by different capabilities and quality characteristics. The self-* objectives provide the system’s ability to autonomously discover, diagnose, and cope with various problems. The captured autonomy requirements are formally specified with the KnowLang notation and then compiled to a knowledge base that is to be used by the KnowLang Reasoner.

 Title:  Synthesizing (Differential) Invariants by Reduction Non-Convex Programming to SDP  
 Abstract:   
 Invariant Generation plays a central role in the verification of programs and hybrid systems. As the constraint solving techniques advance rapidly in recent years, particularly optimization-based constraint solving, optimization based invariant generation becomes more and more promising and has been successfully applied to verification of programs and hybrid systems. However, how to deal with non-convex programming derived from invariant generation is still challenging. In this talk, I report our recent work on efficient invariant generation by reduction non-convex programming to SDP.  

 Mark Lawford   is Chair and Professor of the Department of Computing and Software at McMaster University (Canada). He is a Co-Founder and a past Director of McMaster Centre for Software Certification (McSCert), the 2024 IEEE TCSE Synergy award recipient. He joined McMaster University in 1998, where he helped to develop the software engineering and mechatronics engineering programs. Throughout his career he has work with industry on the practical application of formal methods and model based software engineering to safety critical real-time software. After working with industry partners in the nuclear and medical domains earlier in his career, over the past decade he has increasingly focused on working with OEMs on assurance of automotive systems.  
 Title:  Challenges and Opportunities in Assurance of Software Defined Vehicle  
 Abstract:   
 Automotive innovation is increasingly software driven. As a result of the competitive environment requiring a yearly release of new automotive models featuring the latest driver assistance features and innovation in electrification, safety critical software is being developed at an unprecedented scale on extremely tight deadlines. To be competitive automotive manufacturers and parts suppliers need to change how they develop and assure software intensive systems. This presents a tremendous opportunity for researchers in the application of formal methods and model based software engineering to have a significant impact on industry practice. In this talk we highlight our recent work on model based software engineering, incremental assurance and the potential for applications of formal methods to help the automotive industry make the transition to the Software Defined vehicle.

 Submission Link   

 Doctoral Symposium Paper Submission  
 The ICFEM Doctoral Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to formal methods for software, hardware and system development. This forum is an excellent opportunity bringing together PhD students and well-known established researchers from the formal methods community. It will also provide PhD students with fruitful feedback and advice on their research approach and enable them to interact with other PhD students in order to stimulate the exchange of ideas and the sharing of experiences among participants. In summary, the PhD forum will provide PhD students with an ideal opportunity to present, share and discuss their research in a constructive and critical scientific atmosphere.  
 We seek submissions from PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already published), but who still have substantial work to complete; or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations. It is not required to have a paper accepted at the main conference in order to participate in the ICFEM Doctoral Symposium.  
 Submissions to the Doctoral Symposium should include: Title of the research, the author name (single name) and affiliation; Context and motivation; Problem statement and related work; Proposed solutions and current research efforts, their significance, methodology, results and analysis, and future work. The paper should be prepared using the LNCS format  and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair.  
 The submission should not exceed 6-pages in LNCS format and accepted submissions will be included in the ICFEM 2024 proceedings.  
 Authors with accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Symposium in person to present their work. A discounted registration fee for Doctoral Symposium participants will be announced later.  

 Industrial Applications  
 Submissions to the Industrial Applications track should clearly describe how the relevant formal methods are applied to the development or maintenance of specific software or hardware systems in an engineering manner and should not exceed 6-pages in the LNCS format  . Accepted submissions will be included in the proceedings of ICFEM 2024.

  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania’s largest city, is notable for its rich history, on display at the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall (where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed) and other American Revolutionary sites. Also iconic are the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, immortalized by Sylvester Stallone’s triumphant run in the film "Rocky."

 About  
 ICFEC 2024  

 The 8th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2024) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in the fields of fog and edge computing. ICFEC 2024 will take place in conjunction with The 24th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2024).  
  
  Fog and edge computing have received much attention by both the research community and the industry in recent years, and are today seen as an alternative to the utilization of cloud-based computational resources. Especially, this is the case in scenarios where large amounts of data are produced in distributed settings, e.g., in the Internet of Things (IoT), where data needs to be processed in (near) real time, or where suboptimal network connectivity hampers the upload of very large amounts of data to the cloud. Use cases for fog and edge computing range from smart factories over smart grids to autonomous vehicles, to name just some examples.  
  
  While tremendous progress has already been made in the research fields of fog and edge computing, there are still numerous challenges which need to be solved. New abstractions and extensions to current programming and storage models are necessary to allow developers to design novel applications that can benefit from massively distributed fog and edge systems. Addressing security, privacy, and trust is of paramount importance while managing the resources and context of mobile, transient and hardware-constrained resources. Fog and edge computing can also help to process very large amounts of data, both for batch processing and data streams. The integration of novel communication protocols and communication patterns with fog and edge computing also brings both new opportunities and unique challenges. Recently, the utilization of fog and edge resources in order to realize distributed machine learning in the form of federated learning has also gained much traction, since it allows to learn from local data without sharing raw data with any centralized entity.

  Historically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale.  
 The FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software.  
 Originally a workshop event, since 2018 FormaliSE has been organized as a conference co-located with ICSE. The 13th edition of FormaliSE will also take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025.  
 Area of interest include:  
 requirements formalization and formal specification; 
  approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation; 
  formal approaches to safety and security related issues; 
  analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches; 
  scalability of formal method applications 
  integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change -management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment) 
  model-based engineering approaches; 
  correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering; 
  application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems; 
  formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM); 
  formal methods in a certification context 
  case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches 
  experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems; 
  guidelines to use formal methods in practice; 
  usability of formal methods. 
    
 Call for Papers  
  
 We accept papers in three categories:  
 Full research papers | describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development. 
  Case study papers | discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability). 
  Research ideas papers | describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work. 
  All papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below).  
 Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references. Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references.  
 To avoid that authors waste time fitting their papers into the stated limit at the expense of presentation clarity, paper lengths slightly exceeding the stated limit will still be considered, provided that the reviewers find that the presentation is of high quality.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template  , specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc  or compsocconf  options. Note that IEEE format is being used this year, whereas last year it was ACM format, hence the appearance will differ from year to year.  
 To submit a paper to FormaliSE 2025 use the following HotCRP link  .  
 Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process for Papers   
 As in recent editions, FormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is reducing chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities. The double-anonymous process is, however, lightweight, which means that it should not pose a heavy burden for authors, nor should make a paper’s presentation weaker or more difficult to review. Also, advertising the paper as part of your usual research activities (for example, on your personal web-page, in a pre-print archive, by email, in talks or discussions with colleagues) is permitted without penalties.  
 PAPER SELECTION   
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity.  
 FormaliSE 2025 will adopt a lightweight response process: if all the reviewers of a given paper agree that a clarification from the authors regarding a specific question could move the paper from “borderline” to “accept”, the chairs will relay the reviewers’ questions to the authors by email, and then share their reply with the reviewers in HotCRP. The goal of lightweight responses is reducing the chance of random decisions on borderline papers. Hence, they will only be used for a minority of submissions; most papers will not require such an author response. Nevertheless, we would ask the corresponding authors of all submissions to make sure that they are available to answer questions by email upon request.  
 PUBLICATION   
 All accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings.

41. Conference ICFP_2:
The ACM SIGPLAN  
  International Conference on Functional Programming  

 ICFP (International Conference on Functional Programming)  is an annual programming language conference. It is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM  ) under the aegis of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages ( SIGPLAN  ), in association with Working Group 2.8 of the International Federation of Information Processing ( IFIP  ). ICFP combined two former biennial conferences: Functional Programming and Computer Architecture (FPCA)  and Lisp and Functional Programming (LFP)  .  
 ICFP  provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries.  
 This page is designed to be a permanent home for information about, or relevant to, ICFP. As well as information about the conference itself, it contains pointers to journals, other conferences and workshops, and so on, that may be of interest. Please email suggestions for improvement to Sam Westrick  .  
 Scope  
 ICFP seeks original papers on the art and science of functional programming. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to practice, from foundations to features, from abstraction to application. The scope includes all languages that encourage functional programming, including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as languages with objects or concurrency. Particular topics of interest include:  
 Language Design: | type systems; concurrency and distribution; modules; components and composition; metaprogramming; relations to object-oriented or logic programming; interoperability 
  Implementation: | abstract machines; compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfaces to foreign functions, services components or low-level machine resources 
  Software-Development Techniques: | algorithms and data structures; design patterns; specification; verification; validation; proof assistants; debugging; testing; tracing; profiling 
  Foundations: | formal semantics; lambda calculus; rewriting; type theory; monads; continuations; control; state; effects 
  Transformation and Analysis: | abstract interpretation; partial evaluation; program transformation; program calculation; program proof 
  Applications and Domain-Specific Languages: | symbolic computing; formal-methods tools; artificial intelligence; systems programming; distributed-systems and web programming; hardware design; databases; XML processing; scientific and numerical computing; graphical user interfaces; multimedia programming; scripting; system administration; security; education 
  Functional Pearls: | elegant, instructive and fun essays on functional programming 
  The conference also solicits Experience Reports  , which are short papers that provide evidence that functional programming really works or describe obstacles that have kept it from working in a particular application.

  Welcome to the website of the FormaliSE 2019 conference!  
 The software industry has a long-standing and well-earned reputation for failing to deliver high-quality software. Much progress has been achieved from the early days of software development; still, nowadays, even considering the state of the art of the technologies used, the success of software projects is often not guaranteed. Many of the approaches used for developing large, complex software system are still not able to ensure the correct behavior – and the general quality – of the delivered product, despite the efforts of the (often very qualified and skilled) software engineers involved. This is where formal methods can play a significant role. Indeed, they have been developed to provide the means for greater precision and thoroughness in modeling, reasoning about, validating, and documenting the various aspects of software systems during their development. When carefully applied, formal methods can aid all aspects of software creation: user requirement formulation, design, implementation, verification/testing, and the creation of documentation.  
 However, after decades of research, and despite significant advancement, formal methods are still not widely used in industrial software development. We believe that a closer integration of formal methods in software engineering can help increase the quality of software applications, and at the same time highlight the benefits of formal methods in terms also of the generated return on investment (ROI).  
 The main objective of the conference is to foster the integration between the formal methods and the software engineering communities, to strengthen the – still too weak – links between them, and to stimulate researchers to share ideas, techniques, and results, with the ultimate goal to propose novel solutions to the fraught problem of improving the quality of software systems.  
 Originally a successful satellite workshop of ICSE, since 2018 FormaliSE is organised as a 1-day conference co-located with ICSE. FormaliSE 2019 will take place on May 27th, 2019, in Montreal, Canada.

 ICFP Contest 2024  
  The organizers would like to make some statements about programming languages:  
 Spreadsheet and Rust are very suitable for rapid prototyping.   Congratulations to teams manarimo (Spreadsheet) and Unagi (Rust) for being tied at the first position (for only about 15 minutes) after exactly 24 hours.  Rust is the programming tool of choice for discriminating hackers.   Congratulations to team Unagi (Rust) for winning the contest!  OCaml is a fine programming tool for many applications.   Congratulations to team B$ L$ B$ v$ v$ L$ B$ v$ v$ (OCaml, C++) for taking the second place.  C++ is also not too shabby.   Congratulations to team Purely Functional Networks (C++, Rust, Python, Haxe) for ending up at the third place.  Panicked Albatross are an extremely cool bunch of hackers.   Team Panicked Albatross (Python, C) was picked by the jury because they were just a 2-person team, ending up at rank 33, but they did get the absolute best score for problem 3d12  , the most discussed problem in the whole contest. Furthermore, they published a nice writeup  explaining how they constructed their 3d12  solution.    
 The ICFP Programming Contest 2024 was the 27th instance of the annual programming contest series sponsored by the ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming  .  
 The contest was held from Friday 28 June 2024 at 12:00 UTC  to Monday 1 July 2024 at 12:00 UTC  . There was a lightning division, ending on Saturday 29 June 2024 at 12:00 UTC  .  
 This website remains as an historic artifact for those that want to read about the contest. The task  (including a link to run the contest server locally) is still online, as well as write-ups  by contestants. The organizers have written a report  as a reference for future organizers and contestants.

  Submission Categories   
 Research Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 A research paper must address a topic related to software engineering education using appropriate research techniques and proper scholarly writing. Negative and mixed findings are welcome.  
 Experience Report  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An experience report provides anecdotal evidence by describing an experience related to software engineering education and training (typically a course, a teaching or training technique or strategy, or an assessment method) and interprets the experience in terms of actionable advice and lessons learned, but does not need to evaluate it or use rigorous research methods to support its claims. Negative and mixed findings are welcome, provided they can support advice or lessons learned.  
 Industry Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An industry paper is a research paper or an experience report (as described above) that covers the topic of software engineering education and training in industry. In this category, students are industry practitioners who learn about software engineering in an industry setting.  
 Idea Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 An idea paper must present a new software engineering education and training idea with a proposed formal evaluation strategy, possibly with some preliminary or informal results.  
 Tool Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A tool paper describes a tool or technology built or customized by the authors that supports software engineering education and training. Papers in this category should discuss the impact of the tool on the learning process. A tool paper can optionally be accompanied by a short video (not exceeding five minutes) demonstrating the tool’s main functionality (if you use this option, please provide the link at the end of the abstract). Tools must be available online so they can be evaluated (also possible on a trial basis) and be mature enough.  
 Replication Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A replication paper describes the repetition of an existing and already published pedagogical intervention (e.g. course, approach, study) in new contexts. The goal is to determine whether the basic findings related to the original pedagogical intervention can be applied to other circumstances.  
 Journal-first Submission  (max 1 page)  
 A journal-first submission relates to a software engineering education and training paper already peer-reviewed and published in a journal. The authors will be invited to present their work at CSEE&T. They must submit a one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, its authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper on the journal’s web site.  
 Submissions should not exceed their respective category page limit, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices. The page limits are strict and non-compliance will result in a desk-rejection.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Submissions will be evaluated based on their category:  
 Research Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Verifiability, Presentation 
  Experience Reports  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Actionability, Lessons, Presentation 
  Industry Papers  will be evaluated like Research Papers  when presenting research results and like Experience Reports  when reporting on experiences 
  Idea Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Tool Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Presentation 
  Replication Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Journal-first Submissions  will be evaluated based on their own category, as described above. 
  The evaluation criteria are defined as follows:  
 Relevance | : The extent to which the paper is relevant to CSEE&T. 
  Significance | : The extent to which the paper is well-motivated and its contributions are original and important, with respect to the existing literature on software engineering education and training. 
  Soundness | : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods and whether the paper discusses meaningfully the research methods’ limitations and threats to the validity of the findings. 
  Verifiability | : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. This includes public availability of research data. In cases where this is not possible, an explicit statement covering why such data cannot be made publicly available is mandatory. 
  Actionability | : The extent to which the paper provides actionable advice with clear take-away messages. 
  Lessons | : The extent to which the paper meaningfully discusses lessons learned in terms of what went right, what went wrong, and what could be improved if the experience is repeated. 
  Presentation | : The extent to which the paper’s organization and quality of writing meets the standard: the paper is well-structured, employs clear and correct scholarly language, avoids ambiguity, includes clearly readable figures and tables, and is formatted according to the template specifications. 
  How to Submit   
 All submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the | IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines | (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use | \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} | without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to CSEE&T 2025, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the | ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | and the | IEEE Plagiarism FAQ | . In particular, papers submitted to CSEE&T 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and | must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for CSEE&T 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM and IEEE have been involved in ORCID from the start and we have made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  CSEE&T 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities in the paper nor in the artifacts, code, videos, tools, documentation, or repositories associated with the submission. The authors must make every effort to honor the | double-anonymous review process | . In particular: | Authors’ names | must be omitted from the submission. 
  All | references | to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to CSEE&T 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | ICSE 2025 Q&A | . 
  By submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the IEEE | , | submission policy of the IEEE | , and the | authorship policy of the ACM | (and associated | FAQ | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions to CSEE&T 2025 that meet the above requirements can be made via the submission site   by the submission deadline. Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected without further review  .  
 We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that the formatting guidelines, double anonymous guidelines, and any other submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission.  
 Open Science Policy   
 CSEE&T 2025 aims to follow the ICSE 2025 Open Science policies. In summary, the steering principle is that research results should be made accessible to the public and empirical studies should be reproducible whenever possible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability whenever allowable and applicable.  
 We are aware that some datasets and tools may not be made open and public (e.g., when prohibited by a Non-Disclosure Agreement, when the Ethics Review Board forbids sharing data for participant privacy, when tool source code is commercial-in-confidence, etc.). We also recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and credibility of research results, see the ICSE 2025 Open Science page. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, non-sharing needs to be justified.  
 IMPORTANT  : We therefore ask all authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability  after the Conclusion  section. Authors can also provide anonymized links to anonymized data and repositories in that section or can upload anonymized data using the supplementary material upload option during submission process via the HotCRP submission site  . Authors who cannot disclose data should provide a short statement explaining the reasons why they cannot share the data in the Data Availability section of their paper, after the Conclusion section.  
 Authors are asked to carefully review any supplementary material to ensure it conforms to the double-anonymous policy employed for ICSE 2025. For example, code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site to support review.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

 Best Industry Related Paper Award  
 Home     » Awards     » ICPR Awards     » Best Industry Related Paper Award       

 The Best Industry Related Paper Award will be awarded at each ICPR. The paper will be selected by a committee appointed by the Chair of the Industry Liaison Committee.  
   
  The award is given to a paper selected for oral presentation at ICPR, where at least one of the authors is from a company or technology transfer organization.  
   
  The award is officially announced at the conference dinner. However, there is traditionally a Best Industry Related Paper Award session during the conference some time before the dinner, where the nominees discuss the relation between academic and industrial research. The BIRPA award winner is unofficially announced at this session.  
 Award Procedure   
 The ICPR paper submission system needs to allow authors to self-nominate for the award, where one author must be from a company or a technology transfer organization. Purely university author lists are not eligible. The Program Chair is responsible for ensuring the submission system allows self-nomination. 
  Once paper acceptances are announced and the 'camera-ready' versions of the papers are submitted, the ILC Chair asks the Program Chair for the list of and PDFs of the highly ranked self-nominated oral papers, along with the reviews for those papers. 
  Each ILC member gets (3*num_papers/committee_size) revised papers to read, along with the original reviews. The ILC member does not need to write anything, but is asked to rank the papers in order of best to worst. There is a 3 week deadline. The papers are 6 pages long, so this should take maybe 5 hours. 
  From the ranked papers, the ILC chair selects the top 5(ish) based on the preliminary rankings. The whole ILC reads these and ranks them again. There is a 3 week deadline. 
  From these final rankings, a consensus ordering is formed. The ILC Chair keeps the committee informed about the process. 
  The Chair passes the selected winner's details to the IAPR's Secretary and the IAPR office. 
  The Chair and ICPR Program Chair schedule a 1 hour award session, where the nominees will be asked to give a 5 minute presentation on the relation of research and industry. There will be a panel discussion afterwards, and then finally the announcement of the BIRPA prize. The presentation and panel discussion is not a factor in the award decision.

 ICGT 2025  
   
 The 18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2025)  will be held in Koblenz, Germany, as part of STAF 2025  (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST, EATCS  , and IFIP WG 1.3  .  
 Aims and Scope   
 The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights.  
 ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.

 Abstracts: 28 Jan 2025 
  Paper Submission: 4 Feb 2025 
  Notification: 25 Mar 2025 
  Final version due: 15 Apr 2025 
  Conference: within 10-13 Jun 2025 
  All deadlines are by end-of-day, AoE  
 Submission Types   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. We are currently in discussion whether to go Open Access for ICGT 2025. We will update and detail the calls as soon as possible.  
 (1) Regular research papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), including papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (2) Tool presentation papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description (up to XX pages) which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings.  
 (3) Blue Skies  (up to XX pages), reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories.  
 Furthermore, there will also be a Journal-First track  allowing for previously published work (in book chapters, journals, or other conferences since 2021) to be presented at ICGT 2025.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA).

 ICGT 2025  
   
 The 18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2025)  will be held in Koblenz, Germany, as part of STAF 2025  (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST, EATCS  , and IFIP WG 1.3  .  
 Aims and Scope   
 The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights.  
 ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.

 Abstracts: 28 Jan 2025 
  Paper Submission: 4 Feb 2025 
  Notification: 25 Mar 2025 
  Final version due: 15 Apr 2025 
  Conference: within 10-13 Jun 2025 
  All deadlines are by end-of-day, AoE  
 Submission Types   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. We are currently in discussion whether to go Open Access for ICGT 2025. We will update and detail the calls as soon as possible.  
 (1) Regular research papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), including papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (2) Tool presentation papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description (up to XX pages) which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings.  
 (3) Blue Skies  (up to XX pages), reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories.  
 Furthermore, there will also be a Journal-First track  allowing for previously published work (in book chapters, journals, or other conferences since 2021) to be presented at ICGT 2025.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA).

  Call for Papers   
 In order to foster a lively exchange of perspectives on the subject of the conference, the programme committee of ICGT 2025 encourages all kinds of contributions related to graphs and graph transformation, either from a theoretical point of view or a practical one.  
 Topics   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following subjects:  
 General models of graph transformation (e.g. adhesive categories and hyperedge replacement systems) 
  Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems 
  Graph-based machine learning, including graph neural networks and models of rule inference 
  Graph theoretical properties of graph languages 
  Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages 
  Logical aspects of graph transformation 
  Computational models based on graphs 
  Structuring and modularisation of graph transformation 
  Hierarchical graphs and decomposition of graphs 
  Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformation 
  Term graph and string diagram rewriting 
  Petri nets and other models of concurrency 
  Business process models and notations 
  Bigraphs and bigraphical reactive systems 
  Graph databases and graph queries 
  Model-driven development and model transformation 
  Model checking, program analysis and verification, simulation and animation 
  Syntax, semantics and implementation of programming languages, including domain-specific and visual languages 
  Graph transformation languages and tool support 
  Efficient algorithms (e.g. pattern matching, graph traversal, network analysis) 
  Applications and case studies in software engineering (e.g. software architectures, refactoring, access control, and service-orientation) 
  Applications to computing paradigms (e.g. bio-inspired, quantum, ubiquitous, and visual) 
  Graph transformation and artificial intelligence (e.g., AI for graph transformations, applying graph transformations in AI engineering and search-based software engineering) 
  Important Dates   
 Abstracts: 28 Jan 2025 
  Paper Submission: 4 Feb 2025 
  Notification: 25 Mar 2025 
  Final version due: 15 Apr 2025 
  Conference: within 10-13 Jun 2025 
  All deadlines are by end-of-day, AoE  
 Submission Types   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. We are currently in discussion whether to go Open Access for ICGT 2025. We will update and detail the calls as soon as possible.  
 (1) Regular research papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), including papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (2) Tool presentation papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description (up to XX pages) which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings.  
 (3) Blue Skies  (up to XX pages), reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories.  
 Furthermore, there will also be a Journal-First track  allowing for previously published work (in book chapters, journals, or other conferences since 2021) to be presented at ICGT 2025.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA).
