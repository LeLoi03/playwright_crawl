 Call for Papers  
 The 23rd ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2024) will bring together researchers to engage in a lively debate on the theory and practice of computer networking and networked systems. HotNets provides a venue to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas for the field.  
 We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage submissions that identify fundamental open questions, advocate for new approaches, offer constructive critiques of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Authors need not support their ideas with full evaluations; we consider well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations sufficient support for the possibility of the paper‚Äôs claims in HotNets.  
 We seek early-stage work, where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the community that results in multiple conference papers in related venues (SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, SOSP, OSDI, MobiCom, MobiSys, etc.), rather than a single follow-on conference paper. We strongly discourage ‚Äúconference papers in the miniature,‚Äù and the program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over something that is ready for publication at a conference. Finished work that fits in a short paper is likely a better fit with the short-paper tracks at CoNEXT or IMC.  
 HotNets takes a broad view of networking research. The scope includes new ideas that relate to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks and that use a variety of link technologies (e.g. wired, wireless, optical, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. HotNets encompasses all aspects of networks, which include (but is not limited to) packet-processing and transmission hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, sustainability, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, theory, usability, machine learning, and interactions with applications.  
 The program committee will select position papers based on originality, likelihood to stimulate insightful discussion, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library to facilitate wide dissemination of the ideas discussed at the workshop.  
 Policy on Concurrent Submissions  
 Concurrent submissions to HotNets 2024 and any other peer-reviewed venue that cover the same work (differences in the degree of detail given the two venues‚Äô length limits notwithstanding) are prohibited, and will result in the immediate rejection of the HotNets submission in question. ‚ÄúConcurrent‚Äù means any other peer-reviewed venue whose reviewing period (i.e., between submission and notification) overlaps with that of HotNets. The ‚Äúsame work‚Äù means, for example, a submission overlapping significantly in content with a conference submission. However, a position paper submitted to HotNets (e.g., that reflects broadly on the state of some aspect of the field, adopts a position as to how the field should move forward, or articulates a broad avenue of future work) will not be considered the ‚Äúsame work‚Äù as a conference-length paper on a specific system that addresses a point under the broad umbrella covered by the position paper. Authors with questions about this policy should contact the PC co-chairs before submitting.  
 Ethical Concerns  
 As part of the submission process, authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one‚Äôs institution‚Äôs ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient ‚Äì in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.  
 Workshop Participation  
 HotNets attendance is limited to roughly 90 people in person to facilitate a lively discussion (potentially with additional virtual participants). In-person invitations will be allocated first to one author of each paper, HotNets organizers and committee members, and conference sponsors. We require the paper presentations to be in-person (if authors have any concerns about this, they are welcome to contact the PC chairs). To promote an inclusive workshop, HotNets will also make a limited number of open registration slots for in-person attendance available to the community.  
 Submission and Formatting  
 Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 6 pages, excluding references, in 10 point font. There is no limit on the page count for references, however appendices are not allowed. Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers.  
 All submissions must be blind: they must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (i.e., do not use "et al."). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Please make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected. This archive   contains a LaTeX class file that follows the prescribed submission format. The hotnets24-template.tex  included in the archive has the correct defaults for HotNets 2024 submissions. Specifically, the first two lines should be:  
 \documentclass  [  sigconf, 10pt, anonymous, nonacm ]  {  acmart  }  \settopmatter  {  printfolios=true, printccs=false, printacmref=false }    The default citation style is numeric. Please do not modify the acmart.cls  file or settings to try to sneak in additional space.  
 Submit papers on the HotCRP   .

 Paper submission deadline: | June 27, 2024 (23:59 AoE)

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don‚Äôt use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 Whitepaper  
 From Hallucination to Reality  
 As Federal agencies navigate an increasingly complex and data-driven world, learning how to get the most out of high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) technologies is imperative to their mission. These technologies can significantly improve efficiency and effectiveness and drive innovation to serve citizens' needs better. Implementing HPC and AI solutions in government can bring challenges and pain points like fragmented datasets, computational hurdles when training ML models, and ethical implications of AI-driven decision-making. Still, CTG Federal, Dell Technologies, and NVIDIA unite to unlock new possibilities and seamlessly integrate HPC capabilities into existing enterprise architectures. This integration empowers organizations to glean actionable insights, improve decision-making, and gain a competitive edge across various domains, from supply chain optimization to financial modeling and beyond.

 Whitepaper  
 Why IT Must Have an Influential Role in Strategic Decisions About Sustainability  
 Data centers are experiencing increasing power consumption, space constraints and cooling demands due to the unprecedented computing power required by today‚Äôs chips and servers. HVAC cooling systems consume approximately 40% of a data center‚Äôs electricity. These systems traditionally use air conditioning, air handling and fans to cool the data center facility and IT equipment, ultimately resulting in high energy consumption and high carbon emissions. Data centers are moving to direct liquid cooled (DLC) systems to improve cooling efficiency thus lowering their PUE, operating expenses (OPEX) and carbon footprint.  
   
  This paper describes how CoolIT Systems (CoolIT) meets the need for improved energy efficiency in data centers and includes case studies that show how CoolIT‚Äôs DLC solutions improve energy efficiency, increase rack density, lower OPEX, and enable sustainability programs. CoolIT is the global market and innovation leader in scalable DLC solutions for the world‚Äôs most demanding computing environments. CoolIT‚Äôs end-to-end solutions meet the rising demand in cooling and the rising demand for energy efficiency.

  Authors may include as many pages of appendices as they wish, but reviewers are not required to read these. If you wish to include an appendix, please add it after your references and keep in mind the double blind guidelines. 
  If any content in the Research Paper is generated using Artificial Intelligence tools, authors must transparently and thoroughly describe their use in the methods, acknowledgment, or equivalent section of the paper. Description is not necessary for tools used solely for improving spelling, grammar, and general editing. Authors are accountable for the accuracy of information provided by AI tools and for referencing any supporting work based on that information. 
  The double-blind review process applies to all submissions | ( see ISC High Performance Double-Blind Review Guidelines  ). | Please refrain from including names, affiliations, funding sources, or acknowledgments in the heading or body of the document. Authors should cite their own work in a third-party manner rather than redacting the citations. 
  Papers submitted for the Research Papers track should not have been previously published or under peer review for a different venue. Papers pre-posted to arXiv, institutional repositories, and personal websites remain eligible for submission. 
  Membership on a program committee does not inherently create a conflict of interest in submitting a paper. 

 Review Process   
        Each paper is expected to receive a minimum of 3 to 4 reviews 
  Papers will be evaluated based on novelty, fundamental insights, clarity of presentation, and potential for long-term impact 
  Reviewers will provide constructive, actionable feedback that can be used to improve the paper, whether it is eventually accepted or not 
  The Research Paper Committee reserves the right to reject incorrectly formatted papers 

  Rebuttal Phase   
        Initial reviewer comments will be made available to the authors by the committee 
  Authors can respond to clarify misunderstandings and answer questions 
  Rebuttals will be submitted in written format and will have a tight deadline 
  Authors will receive additional instructions via email 

  Final Decision   
        The paper‚Äôs track committee will consider all reviews and rebuttals 
  Live reviewer discussions will occur during the research paper committee meeting 
  A consensus-driven approach will be used to select the strongest papers 
  Notification of the papers‚Äô outcomes will be sent to authors after the program committee‚Äôs meeting 

 Terms & Conditions  

 The research paper sessions will be held from June 10-12, 2025. 
  By submitting a research paper, you agree that one of the authors will present the work in person at ISC 2025. 
  For a paper to be included in the IEEE Xplore proceedings, at least one author must present it at the conference in person. Otherwise, the paper will be excluded from the proceedings. 
  One author is eligible for a complimentary conference participation pass. 
  Every paper presenter needs to submit a short, pre-recorded summary video of the paper before the conference. 
  Presentation slides and short videos will be available on the event platform (Swapcard) for registered attendees. 
  Travel, accommodation, registration fees for other authors, and other such expenses will not be covered by the ISC organizers.

  Keynote title: The long and winding road to success in B2B enterprise integration Governance dynamics, Data Platforms, Digital Twins and the promises of AI   
   
  Abstract: B2B integration has been receiving much interest over the past few decades. The history of B2B enterprise integration has witnessed fascinating successes and dramatic failures. Technology has made spectacular advances, through the emergence of webservices and APIs, Cloud-based integration platforms (iPAAS), data platforms, open data and federated architectures such as data spaces. Recently, digital twins and the rise of scalable AI based integration Agents add to the impressive technology stack that can be brought to the table in B2B projects. Still, the complexity of these projects goes beyond solving technical challenges. Several projects we have studied and contributed to in our research show that achieving sustainable value and success in B2B integration requires a combination of Technical, Ethical, Legal, Social and Business elements. Through a series of examples and longitudinal case studies from various industry sectors, I will show in this talk what lessons were learned and what the researchers can contribute to making B2B integration a less windy road to success.

 NASA is actively seeking to answer fundamental questions about life beyond Earth through groundbreaking science and exploration missions:  
 Are we alone? 
  What does tomorrow bring? 
  How is our universe changing? 
  For future space missions seeking to answer these questions, there is a need for significant advances in onboard computing. Required advances in computing include navigation and control systems, complex science instruments, robotic science sample acquisition and return, communications, autonomous robotic operations, crewed instrument health and safety monitoring, power generation and management, and autonomous fault handling and recovery.  
 However, space presents challenges to computing. Radiation in the space environment can cause long-term damage to electronic components and cause errors that disrupt computing. Missions beyond Earth orbit can also present a high demand for onboard computing resources because of the time delay to communicate to and from Earth. This communication latency drives the need for many space activities to be performed autonomously and in real-time onboard, without any assistance from ground controllers on Earth. Performing these onboard functions involves running many types of computational workloads in the space environment, including advanced autonomy, AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning, image and signal processing, data flow management, and object detection and classification. All of these workloads require advances in onboard computing technology to meet the demands of increasingly complex missions.  
 NASA‚Äôs Planetary Decadal Study  provides the U.S. with a 10 -year roadmap for space exploration and concludes that future missions demand extensive computational and autonomous capabilities that cannot be met by legacy space processors.  
 Managed by NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and funded by the agency‚Äôs Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD)  at NASA Headquarters in Washington, the High Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) project closes that requirements gap.  

 High Performance   
 The HPSC project will provide high performance AI dataflow processing with scalable vector computing capabilities that are critical for the science and autonomy needs of future advanced space systems.  
   
 Fault-Tolerant   
 This project is specially designed to survive in hazardous space environments and contains features that ensure it can provide reliable results in the harshest of space environments. This capability ensures the execution of critical operations, such as robotically landing or flying on another planet, supporting astronauts in deep space, or operating near small bodies in the outer solar system.  
   
 Power Optimized   
 Because electrical power is a vital resource in space, HPSC is designed to be adaptable in terms of power usage and computing performance. This flexibility allows dynamic, granular control of functions that can be turned off when they are not in use or put into lower power modes. Due to this flexibility to tailor power and performance, the HPSC processor can be used across missions with widely ranging power requirements and can be uniquely suited for missions where the power budget and performance needs vary significantly between mission phases.  
   
 Connectivity  
 Using advanced Ethernet networking technologies, HPSC can connect to a wide array of sensors and other devices. Using these same connectivity technologies, multiple HPSC‚Äôs can be connected together to build bigger systems with enhanced capabilities.  
   
 Built on Industry-Standards   
 The core of the HPSC design is an industry standard, open-source instruction set architecture, bundled with significant fault tolerance, radiation tolerance, and a full security suite as well as all the software required to run it. The HPSC also includes a suite of features and industry-standard interfaces and protocols.  
   Microchip engineers reviewing the High Performance Spaceflight Computer (HPSC) floor plan, a crucial step in the design process that ensures the Microprocessor Unit (MPU) will meet the stringent requirements for future NASA missions, providing the necessary advances in performance, fault tolerance, and flexibility.

 High Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) is the brain of the spacecraft, coordinating and executing the necessary functions to ensure mission success.  
   
 Processing Data   
 Handles vast amounts of data generated by spacecraft instruments and sensors, performing complex calculations and data analysis in real-time.  
   
 Control Systems  
 Runs the software that controls the spacecraft‚Äôs various subsystems, such as navigation, communication, power management, and scientific instruments.  
   
 Communications  
 Manages data communication between the spacecraft and ground control, ensuring that mission data is transmitted efficiently and commands from Earth are received and executed correctly.  
   
 Autonomous Operations  
 Supports autonomous decision-making capabilities, allowing the spacecraft to perform tasks without real-time human intervention, which is crucial for missions far from Earth.  
   
 Error Handling   
 Includes fault tolerance and error correction features to ensure reliable operation in the harsh environment of space, where radiation and extreme temperatures can affect electronic components.  

 The NASA HPSC project is being developed in collaboration with Microchip Technology Inc. and led by a team of engineers at NASA JPL with significant research and development contributions from Microchip.  
 The HPSC project has been active since 2021 and will produce its first processors in early 2025, followed by demonstrations on future NASA or commercial space platforms. This project will advance spaceflight computing needs, offering an unprecedented opportunity for scientific return, future advancements, and upgrades in space computing systems. It will benefit not only NASA and commercial space companies, but also has applications in automotive, consumer, industrial, and aerospace and defense industries. The HPSC processor will be commercially available from Microchip with broad ecosystem and industry support.  
 NASA is leading the SOSA ·µÄ·¥π  (Sensor Open Systems Architecture ·µÄ·¥π  ) Space Subcommittee to foster an interoperable spaceflight avionics standard, which is key to the establishment of an ecosystem that will support the HPSC processor. The SOSA Space Subcommittee has developed significant ecosystem involvement from commercial space providers and is delivering interoperable, industry standard specifications that industry and government can use to build efficient and performant systems.

  The 1st Annual IEEE Communications Society Demonstration Conference  
   
 Welcome to the 2025 IEEE 26th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR)   
 High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR) is an essential technology for today's high-speed, high-capacity data networks; HPSR has supported the wired and wireless network infrastructure of telecommunications carriers and Internet service providers. In these networks, new paradigms such as network virtualization, cloud edge computing, green networking, and the Internet of Things have emerged one after another, and HPSR has played an important role in each of them. In recent years, it has become especially important in data center networking. As artificial intelligence, especially large-scale language models, is expected to transform society, the need for switching and routing of huge amounts of traffic in data center networks has increased the importance of research and development of HPSR. The IEEE International Conference on HPSR has been held annually to date as a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge research results related to HPSR technology and the 26 th  edition will be held in Osaka, Japan from May 20 to May 22, 2025. We hope to contribute to the further development of the HPSR community through the presentation of cutting-edge research results on HPSR and heated discussions among participants. We are looking forward to receiving your contributions of cutting-edge research results on HPSR.

 The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction is a premier, highly-selective venue presenting the latest advances in Human-Robot Interaction. The 20th Annual HRI conference theme is ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, behavioral, theoretical, and methodological, that advance fundamental and applied research in human-robot interaction. Full papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Abstracts Submission  
 Please be aware that from this year we require all full papers to submit an abstract and basic details about the paper a week before the paper submission deadline  . Papers that did not submit the abstract on time will not be accepted  .  
 In addition, the abstract, title, and list of authors information that is submitted at that time must be complete  . Submissions for which it is obvious that the information submitted by the abstract deadline is merely a placeholder or incomplete will be deleted.  
 Format and Submission  
 Full papers are up to eight camera-ready pages, including figures, but excluding references  . Accepted full papers will be published in the conference proceedings and presented in an oral session. Submissions longer than eight pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed.  
 The HRI conference is highly selective with a rigorous, two-stage review model that includes an expert program committee meeting where papers are extensively discussed. As such, all submissions are expected to be mature, polished, and detailed accounts of cutting-edge research described and presented in camera-ready style. In cases of equally qualified papers, positive consideration will be given to submissions that address this year‚Äôs theme: ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù  
 All papers for the conference must be submitted in PDF format and conform to IEEE Proceedings specifications. Templates are available at this link  (use US letter format). In addition, the IEEE has partnered with Overleaf, so you can start writing using the this link  directly.  
 Tracks  
 The HRI 2025 full paper submissions will have five tracks:  
 Theory and Methods 
  Design 
  Technical 
  Systems 
  User Studies 
  Each of these tracks is aligned with a specific type of knowledge contribution and each paper will be assigned to one review subcommittee based on the chosen track. Authors are strongly encouraged to read through the tracks descriptions  at the end of this page.  
 You will need to indicate your choice of track (and optionally your second choice) when you submit your paper. However, note that your choice of the paper track may be changed during the initial paper check stage, if that is deemed more appropriate by the Program Committee.  
 Go to Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks  .  
 Accessibility  
 Make sure to read and follow the accessibility requirements described on the accessibility page  .  
 Anonymization  
 The HRI 2025 full papers review process is double-blind; every aspect of all submissions must be properly anonymized. For full details on how to do anonymization, see the anonymization guidelines  . If a submission contains any element (e.g., text or figures in the full paper document, artifacts, or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines, it will be desk rejected. If there are exceptional circumstances, please contact the Program Chairs as soon as possible ( pc2025@humanrobotinteraction.org  ).  
 Theme Recognition: Robots for a Sustainable World  
 This year, we aim to highlight papers that align with and contribute to our conference theme, ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù We acknowledge the multifaceted nature of sustainability and consider it from various perspectives, including but not limited to environmental impact and climate action. We also welcome papers addressing a wide array of issues outlined by the UN Sustainable Development Goals  . These goals include:  
 Social sustainability: emphasizing the importance of inclusive communities where everyone can thrive, promoting equity and social justice. 
  Technological sustainability: stressing the need to think critically about how our innovations impact society and the environment. 
  Economic sustainability: focusing on creating robust economic systems that support innovation and provide fair opportunities for all. 
  Additionally, we value papers that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable research practices. This includes minimizing the environmental footprint of research activities, promoting ethical data collection and usage, and ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in research design.  
 If you think the paper fits the theme and would like it to be considered for a theme recognition ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World‚Äù, when submitting your paper you will have the option to describe in 1-2 short paragraphs why and how your paper relates to sustainability. This includes the impact of your contribution in the context of sustainability and/or the actions you have undertaken to make your work more sustainable.  
 Supplementary Materials  
 Authors have the opportunity to upload up to three supplemental files in conjunction with their full paper submission. These materials may be submitted via the ‚ÄúSupporting File 1,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupporting File 2,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSupporting File 3‚Äù sections within the full papers submission form in the submission system. While authors are encouraged to upload all supplementary materials directly, it may be infeasible to upload certain items directly (e.g., large data sets or code repositories). In this case, authors may upload a document with a link to where these anonymized supplemental materials are hosted.  
 Supplementary materials are not required for a submission. If authors do choose to submit supplementary materials, such materials may not be used to get around the page limit for full papers  . It is important that any supplemental materials that are uploaded are also properly anonymized. Any submission that contains any element (full paper or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 In general, there are three main types of supplemental materials that may be submitted: videos, appendices, and artifacts (e.g., software, hardware, data sets, etc.).  
 Video Guidelines  
 Authors may submit a 1-minute video (up to 100 MB) as a supplement to their full paper. Videos are not mandatory but may be helpful to visibly showcase a working system, experimental conditions, environment context, results, etc. Only MPG, MPEG or MP4 video formats can be used. Ensure that videos are properly anonymized prior to submission (see Anonymization guidelines  ).  
 Accepted full papers with a video in supplementary material will be considered for Demo Fast Track. More details here  .  
 Artifact Guidelines  
 Across all full paper tracks, we encourage submissions that introduce a novel ‚Äúartifact‚Äù as an enabler to reproducibility, replicability, and recreation of HRI research, and/or to support new lines of HRI research. An artifact could be software, hardware, data sets, protocols, new evaluation measures, etc. Submissions should contain a detailed description of the artifact introduced, proposed, or implemented, as well as information about how it is novel and different from other existing artifacts, and, if possible, a link to an anonymized, live version of the artifact at time of submission for review.  
 Authors submitting artifacts must include with it a text file providing relevant details regarding any aspects related to artifact clearance and release (e.g., obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearance for releasing data collected by human participants, organizational clearances for the release of software/hardware, etc.). Ensure that artifacts are properly anonymized prior to submission. Any submission that includes any element (full paper, artifact, or supplementary materials) that does not follow the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 Appendix Guidelines  
 Authors may upload an appendix directly or provide a link to supporting appendix material hosted anonymously online. Appendices are only for supplementary materials that would interrupt the flow of the text if presented in the main document. Examples may be questionnaires used as measurements, tables of supplementary data, or figures of experimental apparatus.  
 Appendices may not be used to get around the 8-page limit for full paper submissions. Additional experimental analysis, additional results, and lengthy text that clarifies aspects of the full paper submission is not appropriate for an appendix (in other words, full paper submissions must stand on their own without requiring further explanation, analysis, or results provided in the appendix). Any submissions that attempt to use appendices or supplementary materials in general in a manner that violates the page limits will be desk rejected.  
 Note that appendices should not be added to the main document (even if the LaTeX template allows it).  
 Studies with Human Participants  
 As a published ACM/IEEE author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , and IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  including ACM‚Äôs new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (Note: ACM has instituted a new policy on research involving human participants and subjects as of August 15, 2021. Please check the above links if your studies involved human participants and subjects).  
 To support building a strong evidence base in HRI, and encourage future reproducibility of published work, all submissions involving studies with human participants clearly outline their methodology regardless of the theme they are submitted to, including:  
 Participant demographics and sampling approach, e.g. gender, ethnicity, etc. (c.f., | de Graaf 2017 | , Section 2.3, recommendations in | Schlesinger et al., 2017 | , and | HCI Gender Guidelines | ) 
  Data collection and analysis methods (c.f., | Paepcke and Takayama 2010 | , Section V) 
  Study environment and context (c.f., | Short et al. 2018 | , Section 3.5) 
  If a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm was used, a detailed description of the robot, wizard, user, etc. (c.f., | Riek 2012 | , Table 2) 
  If a robot was used, a detailed description of the platform, its level of autonomy, capabilities, etc. (c.f., | Beer et al. 2014 | , Figure 5). 
    
 In addition, studies that involve human participants need to include an ethical approval statement. According to the IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  , ‚ÄúAuthors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.‚Äù In the case of child users, in addition to consent from legal carers / parents, authors should describe how they obtained the oral assent from minors. Examples of such statements are ‚Äúthe study was approved by our Institutional Review Board‚Äù or ‚Äúthe study design, the experiment protocol, and the consent forms received approval from the Ethics Committee of our institution‚Äù (note that these statements must be anonymized). Additionally, during paper submission, authors will be asked to declare whether their research involves human participants, and if it does, whether approval from a relevant ethics committee was obtained.  
 We recognize that some researchers may work in jurisdictions where there is no mandated ethical review, or may not have access to an institutional ethics committee. In such cases, we will follow the ACM‚Äôs Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  , which lists a basic set of standards and practices that a research should follow, and states that ‚Äúwhere such research is conducted in countries where no such local governing laws and regulations related to human participant and subject research exist, authors must at a bare minimum be prepared to show compliance with the above detailed principles.‚Äù In addition to the declaration mentioned above, the paper submission form contains also an optional question allowing authors to describe additional context related to human participant protection. If additional explanations regarding institutional review are needed, and in particular if no ethics approval was obtained for the research, the authors should answer this question with enough detail to show that their research was done in full compliance with the ethical research principles stated in the ACM Policy  .  
 Policy on Use of ChatGPT or Similar Models  
 Text, images or any material generated from foundation models (LLMs, VLMs etc.), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author‚Äôs own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post  describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode ‚Äì please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version for review. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Furthermore, HRI follows the ACM Policy on Authorship  . Please carefully review this policy. Any AI system, including Generative Models, such as ChatGPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by ACM and IEEE. Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.  
 Desk rejects  
 Desk rejects are made during the initial checks of submissions to save our reviewers‚Äô time. The main reasons for a desk rejections include:  
 Scope: clearly out of scope for conference (e.g. no relevance to robots or to human-robot interaction). 
  Anonymization: any violation of the rules detailed in the anonymization guidelines 
  Incomplete submissions: missing submission information (including an obviously placeholder title or abstract, etc.). 
  Formatting issues: | paper is breaking the full paper limit (eight pages excluding references); 
  using an incorrect submission format. 
  Other obvious issues, such as paper clearly unfinished, obvious use of foundation models for generating the contents, not written in English, etc. 
  Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks  
 Theory and Methods  
 The primary contribution for the Theory and Methods track is to further the conceptual foundations of HRI. This work helps us to expand upon the ways we think about human-robot interaction (theory) and upon the ways we engage in doing human-robot interaction research (methods). A key benefit of theory and methods work is not only in articulating what we know but there is also generating new ways of seeing the field and posing new questions.  
  Unlike in earlier years, this track will not include reproducibility. Reproducibility studies should be directed to the User Studies track. Theory papers focus on elucidating or connecting fundamental HRI principles beyond individual interfaces or projects, new theoretical concepts in HRI, literature reviews, etc. Such contributions may include meta-analyses of previous findings, narrative or philosophical arguments introducing theoretical or philosophical concepts, detailing underlying interaction paradigms, or providing new interpretations of previously known results.  
 Methods papers may include new ways of studying HRI, with focus on developing novel evaluation methodologies (e.g. new questionnaires), or in the analysis of existing research and methods derived from original or surveyed empirical research.  
 Successful papers in this track will clearly detail how they transform our current fundamental understanding of human-robot interaction and why the work is significant and has potential for impact. As appropriate, work must be defended by clear and sound arguments and a thorough reflective analysis of the contribution with respect to the existing state of the art.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the theory and methods track:  
 To the extent that methods papers might pertain to new metrics or methods of evaluation, they might include studies; however, the focus of the paper would be on evaluating the novelty and contribution of the concepts and methods, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  Theory papers are not expected to have user studies. 
  Methods for generating design belong in the Design track; methods for measuring or studying HRI belong in the Theory and Methods track. Technical methods or tools belong to the Technical track. 
  If the contribution is a clarification or improvement of an existing theory or method, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Chen et al., 2024  , Kim et al, 2024  , Winkle et al., 2023   
 Design  
 The Design track brings together design-centric research contributions to human-robot interaction (HRI). This includes novel design approaches, new robot morphologies, behavior paradigms, interaction techniques, and the exploration of new contexts for interaction that yield unique or improved interaction experiences with or capabilities for robots. The Design track explicitly welcomes papers focusing on design solutions with rigorous detail, as well as papers on design-driven methodologies (e.g., participatory design, critical design, and design for manufacturability) that influence how designers approach HRI design. Research on the design process itself, or proposing new design products, strategies, frameworks, or models relevant to HRI, belongs in the Design track. Submissions must fully describe their design outcomes or processes to enable detailed review and replication of the design process. Further, successful papers will include evaluations appropriate to the work, such as end-user evaluation or a critical reflection on the design process.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the Design track:  
 While there are often studies in the Design track papers, the focus of these studies lies in evaluating novel aspects and features of the design and resulting response or behavior, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  If the main contribution lies in some aspect of the software or hardware capabilities, and less in how the context or use matches the hardware or software, the paper might belong in the Systems track. 
  If the contribution is an implementation or improvement of an existing design, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Koike et al., 2024  , Walker et al., 2024  , Taylor et al., 2024  , Nanavati et al. 2023   
 Technical  
 The primary knowledge contribution of papers submitted to the technical track is expected to be a novel algorithm (formalized through pseudocode), mathematical model (formalized through a set of equations), tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, and should provide enough detail to allow reproducibility. The expectation is that methods will be at an appropriate level of rigor, approaches will be robust, confounding elements will be clearly noted, and evaluations are suitable to the type of contribution; evaluations do not  need to include user studies unless appropriate.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the technical track:  
 If a submitted paper contains a user study to empirically evaluate or demonstrate the primary knowledge contribution, authors should be clear in the paper why this paper is indeed a ‚Äútechnical‚Äù contribution rather than a ‚Äústudies‚Äù contribution. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the integration of disparate hardware or software capabilities, the paper likely belongs in the Systems track; however, if the novelty or main contribution lies in a novel individual component of a possibly integrated system, then the paper is appropriate for the Technical track. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the development of a code-based implementation of an existing technical contribution, rather than the algorithm or model itself, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Technical work may be evaluated in a variety of ways, non-exhaustively including proofs of correctness, proof-of-concept demonstration, evaluation in simulation (for example with an Wizard-of-Oz approach), performance evaluation of a novel sub-system or component, or user study. It is critical to ensure that the claims made by the paper are backed up by the evaluation. This means that while a well designed and appropriate  user study with a deployed robot may be advantageous, it is not necessary. Further, a poorly designed and inappropriate  user study presented in a technical paper may be worse than including no user study at all. However:  
 Authors of submitted papers whose evaluation does not support the paper‚Äôs claims (e.g., strong claims of an algorithm‚Äôs effect backed up only by a proof-of-concept demonstration or an underpowered user study) might be asked to revise their claims. 
  Authors whose paper does not contain a demonstration or study of a physical robot should provide a ‚Äúpathway to deployment‚Äù describing what would need to be done to reach successful deployment onto a physical platform. Such papers will still need either an analytical or computational/empirical evaluation. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Mahadevan et al., 2024  , Tung et al., 2024  , Trinh et al, 2024  , Brawer et al., 2023   
 Systems  
 Because HRI is by its nature an integrative discipline, the Systems track focuses on contributions which consist of a synthesis of underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior. Generally speaking, a Systems paper is one whose contribution is best observed and measured through performance of an integrated system, usually including a robot, rather than through component-level testing. This could involve some combination of novel system design or integration of novel techniques or components to enable new system-level functionality. The contribution of a Systems track paper could include demonstration of the usefulness of a component or technique in the larger system, achievement of new system-level capabilities, or enhanced system performance. Whether it belongs in these categories or others, authors should emphasize the novelty and significance of their contribution. In particular, authors should highlight what wider systems knowledge, best practices, lessons learned, etc. can be derived from their work and applied to future HRI problems. Papers‚Äô evaluations should be appropriate to the systems contribution being presented, potentially including demonstrations based on scenarios or case-studies, user studies, or technical performance evaluations. Similar to the Technical track, a well-designed  user study can help support a paper‚Äôs claims, but is not strictly necessary for acceptance.  
 Please note that:  
 If the | primary | contribution of a paper is an algorithm or a mathematical model, or is best measured via component-level testing rather than a systems-level evaluation, then the paper likely belongs to the Technical track; 
  If the paper‚Äôs contribution is about presenting a study to better understanding human behavior or preferences rather than system-level behavior based on integration, the paper may belong to the User Studies track; 
  If the contribution is limited to a description of a system design or dataset, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Padmanabha et al., 2024  , Jenamani et al, 2024  , Bouzida et al., 2024  , Schoen et al., 2023   
 User Studies  
 The primary contribution of papers submitted to the studies track is expected to be new knowledge about human-robot interactions, based on a study conducted with people. These studies may take a variety of forms, including laboratory or field studies; other ethnographic and qualitative studies; exploratory, theory-building, or replicative studies; industry case studies, and so forth. These studies may use autonomous robots, Wizard of Oz, or may not involve a physical robot at all. In addition, like last year, reproducibility studies are included in this track. What is most important is the size of the knowledge contribution produced through this study for the human-robot interaction community. Because the primary knowledge contribution in this track is expected to be knowledge from a study with humans:  
 If a submitted paper contains evaluation of an implemented system, it should be clear why the insights from the study with humans are the primary knowledge contribution rather than the system itself, and thus, why the paper belongs in the Studies rather than Technical or Systems track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the creation of a new survey measure or other scientific tools, the paper likely belongs in the Theory and Methods track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is a design process, or the description of a series of design steps used to design a robotic system, then the paper likely belongs in the Design track. For example, if an author performs a series of co-design workshops, the resulting paper would belong in the User Studies track if the contribution of the paper focused on the scientific insights gleaned from the analysis of those workshops, but would belong in the Design track if the contribution of the paper focused on the quality of the design process itself. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the dataset rather than the experimental results themselves, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners from previous years): Pelikan et al., 2024  , Kamino et al., 2024  , Zhanatkyzy et al., 2023  , Ligthart et al., 2022

  Overview of Submission Types  
 There are many ways to contribute to the HRI conference, though the most common is to submit a paper of some new work or research you have done. The work is then evaluated by a group of experts (peer review process) and, if accepted, you‚Äôll have the opportunity to present it in a short talk, poster, video, demo, etc. at the conference.  This guide will give you a quick understanding of the different ways you can present your work at HRI.  
 Mature research work is often submitted as a Full Paper  to the HRI conference. In terms of quality and rigor, full papers are similar to a journal publication in other fields. The papers typically present the outcome of several months or years of hard work. They are anonymous submissions and are thoroughly peer reviewed in a two-stage process that includes an opportunity for authors to respond to the reviewers‚Äô comments before a final decision is made on the paper (rebuttal). You can submit your work under one of several specific tracks (see details on the Full Paper page  ) to ensure that you get the most qualified reviewers for your submission. Accepted Full Papers are published in the main conference proceedings.  
 Another way of contributing to the HRI conference is by submitting a Short Contribution  . The aim of Short Contribution papers is to promote the sharing, reuse, and replication of existing scientific work by submitting datasets or code related to human-robot interaction or by reporting on a replication study. The Short Contributions follow a rigorous review process and are published in the main conference proceedings.  
 If you‚Äôve been working on something you consider especially thought-provoking, controversial or methodologically unusual or risk-taking, you may want to think about writing an alt.HRI  contribution. The subject matter of alt.HRI papers often cuts across HRI themes and the discussion that alt.HRI papers generate can be considered as important as the paper itself. The alt.HRI papers are of similar rigor, quality and length as Full Papers.  
 In addition to the above paper types, the HRI conference has a Late Breaking Reports  track. This is a chance to write up your early research and present it as a Poster at the conference. This is usually a smaller contribution than a Full Paper and a great way to get feedback at the HRI conference.  
 Finally, there are a few other venues through which you can present HRI work at the conference:  
 If you‚Äôve done a great movie about your work, submit it to our | Video | category and get a chance to win a special prize! 
  If you want to submit a specialized installation of some kind or want to show your robot in action, then you should submit to | Demonstrations | . If you‚Äôre a startup looking for a place to show off your robotic system or related software: this could also be a great place to advertise your work or products. 
  Our | Student Design Competition | is an opportunity to submit a novel, wacky, crazy, alternative or bizarre work which doesn‚Äôt fit into any other place. 
  Workshops | are a great way to find your peer group! Let‚Äôs say you are interested in a specific topic, such as personal care robots for older adults or appearance design for robots ‚Äî and you want to meet others with the same interest. Find a few people with similar interests at other institutions or companies. Even for startups trying to find your lead users or people pushing the boundaries of your field, workshops can be a great way to find those people. Workshops can be half or full-day, and attract about 10-25 people. They‚Äôre collaborative events, about meeting new people and presenting early work in a field: if you want to teach people how to do something, then that‚Äôs a | Tutorial | . 
  If you are a student in HRI, the Pioneers Workshop  provides a great venue to present your work and meet with other students.

 The Apex of Innovation  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical Papers is the premier venue for disseminating and discussing scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Submit to Technical Papers  
 The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  
 Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  
 Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). 
  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the ‚ÄúJournal vs. Conference‚Äù table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. 
  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a ‚Äúdual-track submission.‚Äù   
 The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the ‚Äúacmtog‚Äù article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  
   
 Dual-Track Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the ‚Äúacmtog‚Äù article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 How to Submit  
     
  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the ‚ÄúNew Submission‚Äù tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  
 Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  
 Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
 Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.

 Review Process  
     
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Submission Policy  
     
  Double Submissions   
 By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
 The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  
 Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  
 Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see ‚ÄúPlagiarism‚Äù  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
 When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled ‚ÄúPrepublication.‚Äù This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
 Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  
 Lobbying Reviewers   
 It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author‚Äôs own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
     
  Submission Format   
 Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided ‚Äúacmtog‚Äù LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  
 and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 \acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  
 Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM‚Äôs list of accepted LaTeX packages ‚Äî https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added ‚Äî see the documentation for information on that request process.  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the ‚Äúacmart‚Äù class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper‚Äôs ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors‚Äô names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
 Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the ‚ÄúCiting Own Prior Art‚Äù section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers‚Äô discretion.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the ‚Äúproperties‚Äù of a PDF file may contain the creator‚Äôs name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
 Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section ‚ÄúSubmission Format,‚Äù or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
 Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper‚Äôs acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
 Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
 If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
 You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution‚Äôs email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.

 Evaluation  
     
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other‚Äôs identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either ‚Äúconditionally accepted‚Äù or ‚Äúrejected.‚Äù If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to ‚Äútable‚Äù the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
 Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee‚Äôs decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees‚Äô decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author‚Äôs designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.

 Upon Acceptance  
     
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   
 TAPS is ACM‚Äôs article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one‚Äôs article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver ‚Äúcamera-ready‚Äù materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the ‚ÄúStage 3 Program Material‚Äù form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee‚Äôs job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
 ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  
 Papers Fast Forward Session   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 In-Person Presentation   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  
 Presenter Recognition   
 Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  
 To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  
 You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  
 Authorization for Use   
 Any material that supports a paper‚Äôs acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the ‚Äúpublic materials that are considered part of the submission‚Äù section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system‚Äôs final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
 A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
 If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
 Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

 The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction is a premier, highly-selective venue presenting the latest advances in Human-Robot Interaction. The 20th Annual HRI conference theme is ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, behavioral, theoretical, and methodological, that advance fundamental and applied research in human-robot interaction. Full papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Abstracts Submission  
 Please be aware that from this year we require all full papers to submit an abstract and basic details about the paper a week before the paper submission deadline  . Papers that did not submit the abstract on time will not be accepted  .  
 In addition, the abstract, title, and list of authors information that is submitted at that time must be complete  . Submissions for which it is obvious that the information submitted by the abstract deadline is merely a placeholder or incomplete will be deleted.  
 Format and Submission  
 Full papers are up to eight camera-ready pages, including figures, but excluding references  . Accepted full papers will be published in the conference proceedings and presented in an oral session. Submissions longer than eight pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed.  
 The HRI conference is highly selective with a rigorous, two-stage review model that includes an expert program committee meeting where papers are extensively discussed. As such, all submissions are expected to be mature, polished, and detailed accounts of cutting-edge research described and presented in camera-ready style. In cases of equally qualified papers, positive consideration will be given to submissions that address this year‚Äôs theme: ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù  
 All papers for the conference must be submitted in PDF format and conform to IEEE Proceedings specifications. Templates are available at this link  (use US letter format). In addition, the IEEE has partnered with Overleaf, so you can start writing using the this link  directly.  
 Tracks  
 The HRI 2025 full paper submissions will have five tracks:  
 Theory and Methods 
  Design 
  Technical 
  Systems 
  User Studies 
  Each of these tracks is aligned with a specific type of knowledge contribution and each paper will be assigned to one review subcommittee based on the chosen track. Authors are strongly encouraged to read through the tracks descriptions  at the end of this page.  
 You will need to indicate your choice of track (and optionally your second choice) when you submit your paper. However, note that your choice of the paper track may be changed during the initial paper check stage, if that is deemed more appropriate by the Program Committee.  
 Go to Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks  .  
 Accessibility  
 Make sure to read and follow the accessibility requirements described on the accessibility page  .  
 Anonymization  
 The HRI 2025 full papers review process is double-blind; every aspect of all submissions must be properly anonymized. For full details on how to do anonymization, see the anonymization guidelines  . If a submission contains any element (e.g., text or figures in the full paper document, artifacts, or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines, it will be desk rejected. If there are exceptional circumstances, please contact the Program Chairs as soon as possible ( pc2025@humanrobotinteraction.org  ).  
 Theme Recognition: Robots for a Sustainable World  
 This year, we aim to highlight papers that align with and contribute to our conference theme, ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù We acknowledge the multifaceted nature of sustainability and consider it from various perspectives, including but not limited to environmental impact and climate action. We also welcome papers addressing a wide array of issues outlined by the UN Sustainable Development Goals  . These goals include:  
 Social sustainability: emphasizing the importance of inclusive communities where everyone can thrive, promoting equity and social justice. 
  Technological sustainability: stressing the need to think critically about how our innovations impact society and the environment. 
  Economic sustainability: focusing on creating robust economic systems that support innovation and provide fair opportunities for all. 
  Additionally, we value papers that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable research practices. This includes minimizing the environmental footprint of research activities, promoting ethical data collection and usage, and ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in research design.  
 If you think the paper fits the theme and would like it to be considered for a theme recognition ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World‚Äù, when submitting your paper you will have the option to describe in 1-2 short paragraphs why and how your paper relates to sustainability. This includes the impact of your contribution in the context of sustainability and/or the actions you have undertaken to make your work more sustainable.  
 Supplementary Materials  
 Authors have the opportunity to upload up to three supplemental files in conjunction with their full paper submission. These materials may be submitted via the ‚ÄúSupporting File 1,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupporting File 2,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSupporting File 3‚Äù sections within the full papers submission form in the submission system. While authors are encouraged to upload all supplementary materials directly, it may be infeasible to upload certain items directly (e.g., large data sets or code repositories). In this case, authors may upload a document with a link to where these anonymized supplemental materials are hosted.  
 Supplementary materials are not required for a submission. If authors do choose to submit supplementary materials, such materials may not be used to get around the page limit for full papers  . It is important that any supplemental materials that are uploaded are also properly anonymized. Any submission that contains any element (full paper or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 In general, there are three main types of supplemental materials that may be submitted: videos, appendices, and artifacts (e.g., software, hardware, data sets, etc.).  
 Video Guidelines  
 Authors may submit a 1-minute video (up to 100 MB) as a supplement to their full paper. Videos are not mandatory but may be helpful to visibly showcase a working system, experimental conditions, environment context, results, etc. Only MPG, MPEG or MP4 video formats can be used. Ensure that videos are properly anonymized prior to submission (see Anonymization guidelines  ).  
 Accepted full papers with a video in supplementary material will be considered for Demo Fast Track. More details here  .  
 Artifact Guidelines  
 Across all full paper tracks, we encourage submissions that introduce a novel ‚Äúartifact‚Äù as an enabler to reproducibility, replicability, and recreation of HRI research, and/or to support new lines of HRI research. An artifact could be software, hardware, data sets, protocols, new evaluation measures, etc. Submissions should contain a detailed description of the artifact introduced, proposed, or implemented, as well as information about how it is novel and different from other existing artifacts, and, if possible, a link to an anonymized, live version of the artifact at time of submission for review.  
 Authors submitting artifacts must include with it a text file providing relevant details regarding any aspects related to artifact clearance and release (e.g., obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearance for releasing data collected by human participants, organizational clearances for the release of software/hardware, etc.). Ensure that artifacts are properly anonymized prior to submission. Any submission that includes any element (full paper, artifact, or supplementary materials) that does not follow the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 Appendix Guidelines  
 Authors may upload an appendix directly or provide a link to supporting appendix material hosted anonymously online. Appendices are only for supplementary materials that would interrupt the flow of the text if presented in the main document. Examples may be questionnaires used as measurements, tables of supplementary data, or figures of experimental apparatus.  
 Appendices may not be used to get around the 8-page limit for full paper submissions. Additional experimental analysis, additional results, and lengthy text that clarifies aspects of the full paper submission is not appropriate for an appendix (in other words, full paper submissions must stand on their own without requiring further explanation, analysis, or results provided in the appendix). Any submissions that attempt to use appendices or supplementary materials in general in a manner that violates the page limits will be desk rejected.  
 Note that appendices should not be added to the main document (even if the LaTeX template allows it).  
 Studies with Human Participants  
 As a published ACM/IEEE author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , and IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  including ACM‚Äôs new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (Note: ACM has instituted a new policy on research involving human participants and subjects as of August 15, 2021. Please check the above links if your studies involved human participants and subjects).  
 To support building a strong evidence base in HRI, and encourage future reproducibility of published work, all submissions involving studies with human participants clearly outline their methodology regardless of the theme they are submitted to, including:  
 Participant demographics and sampling approach, e.g. gender, ethnicity, etc. (c.f., | de Graaf 2017 | , Section 2.3, recommendations in | Schlesinger et al., 2017 | , and | HCI Gender Guidelines | ) 
  Data collection and analysis methods (c.f., | Paepcke and Takayama 2010 | , Section V) 
  Study environment and context (c.f., | Short et al. 2018 | , Section 3.5) 
  If a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm was used, a detailed description of the robot, wizard, user, etc. (c.f., | Riek 2012 | , Table 2) 
  If a robot was used, a detailed description of the platform, its level of autonomy, capabilities, etc. (c.f., | Beer et al. 2014 | , Figure 5). 
    
 In addition, studies that involve human participants need to include an ethical approval statement. According to the IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  , ‚ÄúAuthors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.‚Äù In the case of child users, in addition to consent from legal carers / parents, authors should describe how they obtained the oral assent from minors. Examples of such statements are ‚Äúthe study was approved by our Institutional Review Board‚Äù or ‚Äúthe study design, the experiment protocol, and the consent forms received approval from the Ethics Committee of our institution‚Äù (note that these statements must be anonymized). Additionally, during paper submission, authors will be asked to declare whether their research involves human participants, and if it does, whether approval from a relevant ethics committee was obtained.  
 We recognize that some researchers may work in jurisdictions where there is no mandated ethical review, or may not have access to an institutional ethics committee. In such cases, we will follow the ACM‚Äôs Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  , which lists a basic set of standards and practices that a research should follow, and states that ‚Äúwhere such research is conducted in countries where no such local governing laws and regulations related to human participant and subject research exist, authors must at a bare minimum be prepared to show compliance with the above detailed principles.‚Äù In addition to the declaration mentioned above, the paper submission form contains also an optional question allowing authors to describe additional context related to human participant protection. If additional explanations regarding institutional review are needed, and in particular if no ethics approval was obtained for the research, the authors should answer this question with enough detail to show that their research was done in full compliance with the ethical research principles stated in the ACM Policy  .  
 Policy on Use of ChatGPT or Similar Models  
 Text, images or any material generated from foundation models (LLMs, VLMs etc.), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author‚Äôs own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post  describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode ‚Äì please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version for review. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Furthermore, HRI follows the ACM Policy on Authorship  . Please carefully review this policy. Any AI system, including Generative Models, such as ChatGPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by ACM and IEEE. Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.  
 Desk rejects  
 Desk rejects are made during the initial checks of submissions to save our reviewers‚Äô time. The main reasons for a desk rejections include:  
 Scope: clearly out of scope for conference (e.g. no relevance to robots or to human-robot interaction). 
  Anonymization: any violation of the rules detailed in the anonymization guidelines 
  Incomplete submissions: missing submission information (including an obviously placeholder title or abstract, etc.). 
  Formatting issues: | paper is breaking the full paper limit (eight pages excluding references); 
  using an incorrect submission format. 
  Other obvious issues, such as paper clearly unfinished, obvious use of foundation models for generating the contents, not written in English, etc.

 The primary contribution for the Theory and Methods track is to further the conceptual foundations of HRI. This work helps us to expand upon the ways we think about human-robot interaction (theory) and upon the ways we engage in doing human-robot interaction research (methods). A key benefit of theory and methods work is not only in articulating what we know but there is also generating new ways of seeing the field and posing new questions.  
  Unlike in earlier years, this track will not include reproducibility. Reproducibility studies should be directed to the User Studies track. Theory papers focus on elucidating or connecting fundamental HRI principles beyond individual interfaces or projects, new theoretical concepts in HRI, literature reviews, etc. Such contributions may include meta-analyses of previous findings, narrative or philosophical arguments introducing theoretical or philosophical concepts, detailing underlying interaction paradigms, or providing new interpretations of previously known results.  
 Methods papers may include new ways of studying HRI, with focus on developing novel evaluation methodologies (e.g. new questionnaires), or in the analysis of existing research and methods derived from original or surveyed empirical research.  
 Successful papers in this track will clearly detail how they transform our current fundamental understanding of human-robot interaction and why the work is significant and has potential for impact. As appropriate, work must be defended by clear and sound arguments and a thorough reflective analysis of the contribution with respect to the existing state of the art.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the theory and methods track:  
 To the extent that methods papers might pertain to new metrics or methods of evaluation, they might include studies; however, the focus of the paper would be on evaluating the novelty and contribution of the concepts and methods, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  Theory papers are not expected to have user studies. 
  Methods for generating design belong in the Design track; methods for measuring or studying HRI belong in the Theory and Methods track. Technical methods or tools belong to the Technical track. 
  If the contribution is a clarification or improvement of an existing theory or method, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Chen et al., 2024  , Kim et al, 2024  , Winkle et al., 2023   
 Design  
 The Design track brings together design-centric research contributions to human-robot interaction (HRI). This includes novel design approaches, new robot morphologies, behavior paradigms, interaction techniques, and the exploration of new contexts for interaction that yield unique or improved interaction experiences with or capabilities for robots. The Design track explicitly welcomes papers focusing on design solutions with rigorous detail, as well as papers on design-driven methodologies (e.g., participatory design, critical design, and design for manufacturability) that influence how designers approach HRI design. Research on the design process itself, or proposing new design products, strategies, frameworks, or models relevant to HRI, belongs in the Design track. Submissions must fully describe their design outcomes or processes to enable detailed review and replication of the design process. Further, successful papers will include evaluations appropriate to the work, such as end-user evaluation or a critical reflection on the design process.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the Design track:  
 While there are often studies in the Design track papers, the focus of these studies lies in evaluating novel aspects and features of the design and resulting response or behavior, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  If the main contribution lies in some aspect of the software or hardware capabilities, and less in how the context or use matches the hardware or software, the paper might belong in the Systems track. 
  If the contribution is an implementation or improvement of an existing design, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Koike et al., 2024  , Walker et al., 2024  , Taylor et al., 2024  , Nanavati et al. 2023   
 Technical  
 The primary knowledge contribution of papers submitted to the technical track is expected to be a novel algorithm (formalized through pseudocode), mathematical model (formalized through a set of equations), tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, and should provide enough detail to allow reproducibility. The expectation is that methods will be at an appropriate level of rigor, approaches will be robust, confounding elements will be clearly noted, and evaluations are suitable to the type of contribution; evaluations do not  need to include user studies unless appropriate.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the technical track:  
 If a submitted paper contains a user study to empirically evaluate or demonstrate the primary knowledge contribution, authors should be clear in the paper why this paper is indeed a ‚Äútechnical‚Äù contribution rather than a ‚Äústudies‚Äù contribution. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the integration of disparate hardware or software capabilities, the paper likely belongs in the Systems track; however, if the novelty or main contribution lies in a novel individual component of a possibly integrated system, then the paper is appropriate for the Technical track. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the development of a code-based implementation of an existing technical contribution, rather than the algorithm or model itself, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Technical work may be evaluated in a variety of ways, non-exhaustively including proofs of correctness, proof-of-concept demonstration, evaluation in simulation (for example with an Wizard-of-Oz approach), performance evaluation of a novel sub-system or component, or user study. It is critical to ensure that the claims made by the paper are backed up by the evaluation. This means that while a well designed and appropriate  user study with a deployed robot may be advantageous, it is not necessary. Further, a poorly designed and inappropriate  user study presented in a technical paper may be worse than including no user study at all. However:  
 Authors of submitted papers whose evaluation does not support the paper‚Äôs claims (e.g., strong claims of an algorithm‚Äôs effect backed up only by a proof-of-concept demonstration or an underpowered user study) might be asked to revise their claims. 
  Authors whose paper does not contain a demonstration or study of a physical robot should provide a ‚Äúpathway to deployment‚Äù describing what would need to be done to reach successful deployment onto a physical platform. Such papers will still need either an analytical or computational/empirical evaluation. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Mahadevan et al., 2024  , Tung et al., 2024  , Trinh et al, 2024  , Brawer et al., 2023   
 Systems  
 Because HRI is by its nature an integrative discipline, the Systems track focuses on contributions which consist of a synthesis of underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior. Generally speaking, a Systems paper is one whose contribution is best observed and measured through performance of an integrated system, usually including a robot, rather than through component-level testing. This could involve some combination of novel system design or integration of novel techniques or components to enable new system-level functionality. The contribution of a Systems track paper could include demonstration of the usefulness of a component or technique in the larger system, achievement of new system-level capabilities, or enhanced system performance. Whether it belongs in these categories or others, authors should emphasize the novelty and significance of their contribution. In particular, authors should highlight what wider systems knowledge, best practices, lessons learned, etc. can be derived from their work and applied to future HRI problems. Papers‚Äô evaluations should be appropriate to the systems contribution being presented, potentially including demonstrations based on scenarios or case-studies, user studies, or technical performance evaluations. Similar to the Technical track, a well-designed  user study can help support a paper‚Äôs claims, but is not strictly necessary for acceptance.  
 Please note that:  
 If the | primary | contribution of a paper is an algorithm or a mathematical model, or is best measured via component-level testing rather than a systems-level evaluation, then the paper likely belongs to the Technical track; 
  If the paper‚Äôs contribution is about presenting a study to better understanding human behavior or preferences rather than system-level behavior based on integration, the paper may belong to the User Studies track; 
  If the contribution is limited to a description of a system design or dataset, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Padmanabha et al., 2024  , Jenamani et al, 2024  , Bouzida et al., 2024  , Schoen et al., 2023   
 User Studies  
 The primary contribution of papers submitted to the studies track is expected to be new knowledge about human-robot interactions, based on a study conducted with people. These studies may take a variety of forms, including laboratory or field studies; other ethnographic and qualitative studies; exploratory, theory-building, or replicative studies; industry case studies, and so forth. These studies may use autonomous robots, Wizard of Oz, or may not involve a physical robot at all. In addition, like last year, reproducibility studies are included in this track. What is most important is the size of the knowledge contribution produced through this study for the human-robot interaction community. Because the primary knowledge contribution in this track is expected to be knowledge from a study with humans:  
 If a submitted paper contains evaluation of an implemented system, it should be clear why the insights from the study with humans are the primary knowledge contribution rather than the system itself, and thus, why the paper belongs in the Studies rather than Technical or Systems track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the creation of a new survey measure or other scientific tools, the paper likely belongs in the Theory and Methods track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is a design process, or the description of a series of design steps used to design a robotic system, then the paper likely belongs in the Design track. For example, if an author performs a series of co-design workshops, the resulting paper would belong in the User Studies track if the contribution of the paper focused on the scientific insights gleaned from the analysis of those workshops, but would belong in the Design track if the contribution of the paper focused on the quality of the design process itself. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the dataset rather than the experimental results themselves, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners from previous years): Pelikan et al., 2024  , Kamino et al., 2024  , Zhanatkyzy et al., 2023  , Ligthart et al., 2022

 The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction is a premier, highly-selective venue presenting the latest advances in Human-Robot Interaction. The 20th Annual HRI conference theme is ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, behavioral, theoretical, and methodological, that advance fundamental and applied research in human-robot interaction. Full papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Abstracts Submission  
 Please be aware that from this year we require all full papers to submit an abstract and basic details about the paper a week before the paper submission deadline  . Papers that did not submit the abstract on time will not be accepted  .  
 In addition, the abstract, title, and list of authors information that is submitted at that time must be complete  . Submissions for which it is obvious that the information submitted by the abstract deadline is merely a placeholder or incomplete will be deleted.  
 Format and Submission  
 Full papers are up to eight camera-ready pages, including figures, but excluding references  . Accepted full papers will be published in the conference proceedings and presented in an oral session. Submissions longer than eight pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed.  
 The HRI conference is highly selective with a rigorous, two-stage review model that includes an expert program committee meeting where papers are extensively discussed. As such, all submissions are expected to be mature, polished, and detailed accounts of cutting-edge research described and presented in camera-ready style. In cases of equally qualified papers, positive consideration will be given to submissions that address this year‚Äôs theme: ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù  
 All papers for the conference must be submitted in PDF format and conform to IEEE Proceedings specifications. Templates are available at this link  (use US letter format). In addition, the IEEE has partnered with Overleaf, so you can start writing using the this link  directly.  
 Tracks  
 The HRI 2025 full paper submissions will have five tracks:  
 Theory and Methods 
  Design 
  Technical 
  Systems 
  User Studies 
  Each of these tracks is aligned with a specific type of knowledge contribution and each paper will be assigned to one review subcommittee based on the chosen track. Authors are strongly encouraged to read through the tracks descriptions  at the end of this page.  
 You will need to indicate your choice of track (and optionally your second choice) when you submit your paper. However, note that your choice of the paper track may be changed during the initial paper check stage, if that is deemed more appropriate by the Program Committee.

 Accessibility  
 Make sure to read and follow the accessibility requirements described on the accessibility page  .  
 Anonymization  
 The HRI 2025 full papers review process is double-blind; every aspect of all submissions must be properly anonymized. For full details on how to do anonymization, see the anonymization guidelines  . If a submission contains any element (e.g., text or figures in the full paper document, artifacts, or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines, it will be desk rejected. If there are exceptional circumstances, please contact the Program Chairs as soon as possible ( pc2025@humanrobotinteraction.org  ).  
 Theme Recognition: Robots for a Sustainable World  
 This year, we aim to highlight papers that align with and contribute to our conference theme, ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù We acknowledge the multifaceted nature of sustainability and consider it from various perspectives, including but not limited to environmental impact and climate action. We also welcome papers addressing a wide array of issues outlined by the UN Sustainable Development Goals  . These goals include:  
 Social sustainability: emphasizing the importance of inclusive communities where everyone can thrive, promoting equity and social justice. 
  Technological sustainability: stressing the need to think critically about how our innovations impact society and the environment. 
  Economic sustainability: focusing on creating robust economic systems that support innovation and provide fair opportunities for all. 
  Additionally, we value papers that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable research practices. This includes minimizing the environmental footprint of research activities, promoting ethical data collection and usage, and ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in research design.  
 If you think the paper fits the theme and would like it to be considered for a theme recognition ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World‚Äù, when submitting your paper you will have the option to describe in 1-2 short paragraphs why and how your paper relates to sustainability. This includes the impact of your contribution in the context of sustainability and/or the actions you have undertaken to make your work more sustainable.  
 Supplementary Materials  
 Authors have the opportunity to upload up to three supplemental files in conjunction with their full paper submission. These materials may be submitted via the ‚ÄúSupporting File 1,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupporting File 2,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSupporting File 3‚Äù sections within the full papers submission form in the submission system. While authors are encouraged to upload all supplementary materials directly, it may be infeasible to upload certain items directly (e.g., large data sets or code repositories). In this case, authors may upload a document with a link to where these anonymized supplemental materials are hosted.  
 Supplementary materials are not required for a submission. If authors do choose to submit supplementary materials, such materials may not be used to get around the page limit for full papers  . It is important that any supplemental materials that are uploaded are also properly anonymized. Any submission that contains any element (full paper or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 In general, there are three main types of supplemental materials that may be submitted: videos, appendices, and artifacts (e.g., software, hardware, data sets, etc.).  
 Video Guidelines  
 Authors may submit a 1-minute video (up to 100 MB) as a supplement to their full paper. Videos are not mandatory but may be helpful to visibly showcase a working system, experimental conditions, environment context, results, etc. Only MPG, MPEG or MP4 video formats can be used. Ensure that videos are properly anonymized prior to submission (see Anonymization guidelines  ).  
 Accepted full papers with a video in supplementary material will be considered for Demo Fast Track. More details here  .  
 Artifact Guidelines  
 Across all full paper tracks, we encourage submissions that introduce a novel ‚Äúartifact‚Äù as an enabler to reproducibility, replicability, and recreation of HRI research, and/or to support new lines of HRI research. An artifact could be software, hardware, data sets, protocols, new evaluation measures, etc. Submissions should contain a detailed description of the artifact introduced, proposed, or implemented, as well as information about how it is novel and different from other existing artifacts, and, if possible, a link to an anonymized, live version of the artifact at time of submission for review.  
 Authors submitting artifacts must include with it a text file providing relevant details regarding any aspects related to artifact clearance and release (e.g., obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearance for releasing data collected by human participants, organizational clearances for the release of software/hardware, etc.). Ensure that artifacts are properly anonymized prior to submission. Any submission that includes any element (full paper, artifact, or supplementary materials) that does not follow the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 Appendix Guidelines  
 Authors may upload an appendix directly or provide a link to supporting appendix material hosted anonymously online. Appendices are only for supplementary materials that would interrupt the flow of the text if presented in the main document. Examples may be questionnaires used as measurements, tables of supplementary data, or figures of experimental apparatus.  
 Appendices may not be used to get around the 8-page limit for full paper submissions. Additional experimental analysis, additional results, and lengthy text that clarifies aspects of the full paper submission is not appropriate for an appendix (in other words, full paper submissions must stand on their own without requiring further explanation, analysis, or results provided in the appendix). Any submissions that attempt to use appendices or supplementary materials in general in a manner that violates the page limits will be desk rejected.  
 Note that appendices should not be added to the main document (even if the LaTeX template allows it).  
 Studies with Human Participants  
 As a published ACM/IEEE author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , and IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  including ACM‚Äôs new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (Note: ACM has instituted a new policy on research involving human participants and subjects as of August 15, 2021. Please check the above links if your studies involved human participants and subjects).  
 To support building a strong evidence base in HRI, and encourage future reproducibility of published work, all submissions involving studies with human participants clearly outline their methodology regardless of the theme they are submitted to, including:  
 Participant demographics and sampling approach, e.g. gender, ethnicity, etc. (c.f., | de Graaf 2017 | , Section 2.3, recommendations in | Schlesinger et al., 2017 | , and | HCI Gender Guidelines | ) 
  Data collection and analysis methods (c.f., | Paepcke and Takayama 2010 | , Section V) 
  Study environment and context (c.f., | Short et al. 2018 | , Section 3.5) 
  If a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm was used, a detailed description of the robot, wizard, user, etc. (c.f., | Riek 2012 | , Table 2) 
  If a robot was used, a detailed description of the platform, its level of autonomy, capabilities, etc. (c.f., | Beer et al. 2014 | , Figure 5). 
    
 In addition, studies that involve human participants need to include an ethical approval statement. According to the IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  , ‚ÄúAuthors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.‚Äù In the case of child users, in addition to consent from legal carers / parents, authors should describe how they obtained the oral assent from minors. Examples of such statements are ‚Äúthe study was approved by our Institutional Review Board‚Äù or ‚Äúthe study design, the experiment protocol, and the consent forms received approval from the Ethics Committee of our institution‚Äù (note that these statements must be anonymized). Additionally, during paper submission, authors will be asked to declare whether their research involves human participants, and if it does, whether approval from a relevant ethics committee was obtained.  
 We recognize that some researchers may work in jurisdictions where there is no mandated ethical review, or may not have access to an institutional ethics committee. In such cases, we will follow the ACM‚Äôs Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  , which lists a basic set of standards and practices that a research should follow, and states that ‚Äúwhere such research is conducted in countries where no such local governing laws and regulations related to human participant and subject research exist, authors must at a bare minimum be prepared to show compliance with the above detailed principles.‚Äù In addition to the declaration mentioned above, the paper submission form contains also an optional question allowing authors to describe additional context related to human participant protection. If additional explanations regarding institutional review are needed, and in particular if no ethics approval was obtained for the research, the authors should answer this question with enough detail to show that their research was done in full compliance with the ethical research principles stated in the ACM Policy  .  
 Policy on Use of ChatGPT or Similar Models  
 Text, images or any material generated from foundation models (LLMs, VLMs etc.), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author‚Äôs own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post  describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode ‚Äì please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version for review. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Furthermore, HRI follows the ACM Policy on Authorship  . Please carefully review this policy. Any AI system, including Generative Models, such as ChatGPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by ACM and IEEE. Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.  
 Desk rejects  
 Desk rejects are made during the initial checks of submissions to save our reviewers‚Äô time. The main reasons for a desk rejections include:  
 Scope: clearly out of scope for conference (e.g. no relevance to robots or to human-robot interaction). 
  Anonymization: any violation of the rules detailed in the anonymization guidelines 
  Incomplete submissions: missing submission information (including an obviously placeholder title or abstract, etc.). 
  Formatting issues: | paper is breaking the full paper limit (eight pages excluding references); 
  using an incorrect submission format. 
  Other obvious issues, such as paper clearly unfinished, obvious use of foundation models for generating the contents, not written in English, etc. 
  Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks  
 Theory and Methods  
 The primary contribution for the Theory and Methods track is to further the conceptual foundations of HRI. This work helps us to expand upon the ways we think about human-robot interaction (theory) and upon the ways we engage in doing human-robot interaction research (methods). A key benefit of theory and methods work is not only in articulating what we know but there is also generating new ways of seeing the field and posing new questions.  
  Unlike in earlier years, this track will not include reproducibility. Reproducibility studies should be directed to the User Studies track. Theory papers focus on elucidating or connecting fundamental HRI principles beyond individual interfaces or projects, new theoretical concepts in HRI, literature reviews, etc. Such contributions may include meta-analyses of previous findings, narrative or philosophical arguments introducing theoretical or philosophical concepts, detailing underlying interaction paradigms, or providing new interpretations of previously known results.  
 Methods papers may include new ways of studying HRI, with focus on developing novel evaluation methodologies (e.g. new questionnaires), or in the analysis of existing research and methods derived from original or surveyed empirical research.  
 Successful papers in this track will clearly detail how they transform our current fundamental understanding of human-robot interaction and why the work is significant and has potential for impact. As appropriate, work must be defended by clear and sound arguments and a thorough reflective analysis of the contribution with respect to the existing state of the art.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the theory and methods track:  
 To the extent that methods papers might pertain to new metrics or methods of evaluation, they might include studies; however, the focus of the paper would be on evaluating the novelty and contribution of the concepts and methods, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  Theory papers are not expected to have user studies. 
  Methods for generating design belong in the Design track; methods for measuring or studying HRI belong in the Theory and Methods track. Technical methods or tools belong to the Technical track. 
  If the contribution is a clarification or improvement of an existing theory or method, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Chen et al., 2024  , Kim et al, 2024  , Winkle et al., 2023   
 Design  
 The Design track brings together design-centric research contributions to human-robot interaction (HRI). This includes novel design approaches, new robot morphologies, behavior paradigms, interaction techniques, and the exploration of new contexts for interaction that yield unique or improved interaction experiences with or capabilities for robots. The Design track explicitly welcomes papers focusing on design solutions with rigorous detail, as well as papers on design-driven methodologies (e.g., participatory design, critical design, and design for manufacturability) that influence how designers approach HRI design. Research on the design process itself, or proposing new design products, strategies, frameworks, or models relevant to HRI, belongs in the Design track. Submissions must fully describe their design outcomes or processes to enable detailed review and replication of the design process. Further, successful papers will include evaluations appropriate to the work, such as end-user evaluation or a critical reflection on the design process.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the Design track:  
 While there are often studies in the Design track papers, the focus of these studies lies in evaluating novel aspects and features of the design and resulting response or behavior, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  If the main contribution lies in some aspect of the software or hardware capabilities, and less in how the context or use matches the hardware or software, the paper might belong in the Systems track. 
  If the contribution is an implementation or improvement of an existing design, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Koike et al., 2024  , Walker et al., 2024  , Taylor et al., 2024  , Nanavati et al. 2023   
 Technical  
 The primary knowledge contribution of papers submitted to the technical track is expected to be a novel algorithm (formalized through pseudocode), mathematical model (formalized through a set of equations), tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, and should provide enough detail to allow reproducibility. The expectation is that methods will be at an appropriate level of rigor, approaches will be robust, confounding elements will be clearly noted, and evaluations are suitable to the type of contribution; evaluations do not  need to include user studies unless appropriate.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the technical track:  
 If a submitted paper contains a user study to empirically evaluate or demonstrate the primary knowledge contribution, authors should be clear in the paper why this paper is indeed a ‚Äútechnical‚Äù contribution rather than a ‚Äústudies‚Äù contribution. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the integration of disparate hardware or software capabilities, the paper likely belongs in the Systems track; however, if the novelty or main contribution lies in a novel individual component of a possibly integrated system, then the paper is appropriate for the Technical track. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the development of a code-based implementation of an existing technical contribution, rather than the algorithm or model itself, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Technical work may be evaluated in a variety of ways, non-exhaustively including proofs of correctness, proof-of-concept demonstration, evaluation in simulation (for example with an Wizard-of-Oz approach), performance evaluation of a novel sub-system or component, or user study. It is critical to ensure that the claims made by the paper are backed up by the evaluation. This means that while a well designed and appropriate  user study with a deployed robot may be advantageous, it is not necessary. Further, a poorly designed and inappropriate  user study presented in a technical paper may be worse than including no user study at all. However:  
 Authors of submitted papers whose evaluation does not support the paper‚Äôs claims (e.g., strong claims of an algorithm‚Äôs effect backed up only by a proof-of-concept demonstration or an underpowered user study) might be asked to revise their claims. 
  Authors whose paper does not contain a demonstration or study of a physical robot should provide a ‚Äúpathway to deployment‚Äù describing what would need to be done to reach successful deployment onto a physical platform. Such papers will still need either an analytical or computational/empirical evaluation. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Mahadevan et al., 2024  , Tung et al., 2024  , Trinh et al, 2024  , Brawer et al., 2023   
 Systems  
 Because HRI is by its nature an integrative discipline, the Systems track focuses on contributions which consist of a synthesis of underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior. Generally speaking, a Systems paper is one whose contribution is best observed and measured through performance of an integrated system, usually including a robot, rather than through component-level testing. This could involve some combination of novel system design or integration of novel techniques or components to enable new system-level functionality. The contribution of a Systems track paper could include demonstration of the usefulness of a component or technique in the larger system, achievement of new system-level capabilities, or enhanced system performance. Whether it belongs in these categories or others, authors should emphasize the novelty and significance of their contribution. In particular, authors should highlight what wider systems knowledge, best practices, lessons learned, etc. can be derived from their work and applied to future HRI problems. Papers‚Äô evaluations should be appropriate to the systems contribution being presented, potentially including demonstrations based on scenarios or case-studies, user studies, or technical performance evaluations. Similar to the Technical track, a well-designed  user study can help support a paper‚Äôs claims, but is not strictly necessary for acceptance.  
 Please note that:  
 If the | primary | contribution of a paper is an algorithm or a mathematical model, or is best measured via component-level testing rather than a systems-level evaluation, then the paper likely belongs to the Technical track; 
  If the paper‚Äôs contribution is about presenting a study to better understanding human behavior or preferences rather than system-level behavior based on integration, the paper may belong to the User Studies track; 
  If the contribution is limited to a description of a system design or dataset, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Padmanabha et al., 2024  , Jenamani et al, 2024  , Bouzida et al., 2024  , Schoen et al., 2023   
 User Studies  
 The primary contribution of papers submitted to the studies track is expected to be new knowledge about human-robot interactions, based on a study conducted with people. These studies may take a variety of forms, including laboratory or field studies; other ethnographic and qualitative studies; exploratory, theory-building, or replicative studies; industry case studies, and so forth. These studies may use autonomous robots, Wizard of Oz, or may not involve a physical robot at all. In addition, like last year, reproducibility studies are included in this track. What is most important is the size of the knowledge contribution produced through this study for the human-robot interaction community. Because the primary knowledge contribution in this track is expected to be knowledge from a study with humans:  
 If a submitted paper contains evaluation of an implemented system, it should be clear why the insights from the study with humans are the primary knowledge contribution rather than the system itself, and thus, why the paper belongs in the Studies rather than Technical or Systems track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the creation of a new survey measure or other scientific tools, the paper likely belongs in the Theory and Methods track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is a design process, or the description of a series of design steps used to design a robotic system, then the paper likely belongs in the Design track. For example, if an author performs a series of co-design workshops, the resulting paper would belong in the User Studies track if the contribution of the paper focused on the scientific insights gleaned from the analysis of those workshops, but would belong in the Design track if the contribution of the paper focused on the quality of the design process itself. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the dataset rather than the experimental results themselves, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners from previous years): Pelikan et al., 2024  , Kamino et al., 2024  , Zhanatkyzy et al., 2023  , Ligthart et al., 2022

  Overview of Submission Types  
 There are many ways to contribute to the HRI conference, though the most common is to submit a paper of some new work or research you have done. The work is then evaluated by a group of experts (peer review process) and, if accepted, you‚Äôll have the opportunity to present it in a short talk, poster, video, demo, etc. at the conference.  This guide will give you a quick understanding of the different ways you can present your work at HRI.  
 Mature research work is often submitted as a Full Paper  to the HRI conference. In terms of quality and rigor, full papers are similar to a journal publication in other fields. The papers typically present the outcome of several months or years of hard work. They are anonymous submissions and are thoroughly peer reviewed in a two-stage process that includes an opportunity for authors to respond to the reviewers‚Äô comments before a final decision is made on the paper (rebuttal). You can submit your work under one of several specific tracks (see details on the Full Paper page  ) to ensure that you get the most qualified reviewers for your submission. Accepted Full Papers are published in the main conference proceedings.  
 Another way of contributing to the HRI conference is by submitting a Short Contribution  . The aim of Short Contribution papers is to promote the sharing, reuse, and replication of existing scientific work by submitting datasets or code related to human-robot interaction or by reporting on a replication study. The Short Contributions follow a rigorous review process and are published in the main conference proceedings.  
 If you‚Äôve been working on something you consider especially thought-provoking, controversial or methodologically unusual or risk-taking, you may want to think about writing an alt.HRI  contribution. The subject matter of alt.HRI papers often cuts across HRI themes and the discussion that alt.HRI papers generate can be considered as important as the paper itself. The alt.HRI papers are of similar rigor, quality and length as Full Papers.  
 In addition to the above paper types, the HRI conference has a Late Breaking Reports  track. This is a chance to write up your early research and present it as a Poster at the conference. This is usually a smaller contribution than a Full Paper and a great way to get feedback at the HRI conference.  
 Finally, there are a few other venues through which you can present HRI work at the conference:  
 If you‚Äôve done a great movie about your work, submit it to our | Video | category and get a chance to win a special prize! 
  If you want to submit a specialized installation of some kind or want to show your robot in action, then you should submit to | Demonstrations | . If you‚Äôre a startup looking for a place to show off your robotic system or related software: this could also be a great place to advertise your work or products. 
  Our | Student Design Competition | is an opportunity to submit a novel, wacky, crazy, alternative or bizarre work which doesn‚Äôt fit into any other place. 
  Workshops | are a great way to find your peer group! Let‚Äôs say you are interested in a specific topic, such as personal care robots for older adults or appearance design for robots ‚Äî and you want to meet others with the same interest. Find a few people with similar interests at other institutions or companies. Even for startups trying to find your lead users or people pushing the boundaries of your field, workshops can be a great way to find those people. Workshops can be half or full-day, and attract about 10-25 people. They‚Äôre collaborative events, about meeting new people and presenting early work in a field: if you want to teach people how to do something, then that‚Äôs a | Tutorial | . 
  If you are a student in HRI, the Pioneers Workshop  provides a great venue to present your work and meet with other students.  
 (This overview was originally inspired by similar guides provided by the CHI conference organizers.)

 The Apex of Innovation  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical Papers is the premier venue for disseminating and discussing scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  

 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  
 Submit to Technical Papers  
 The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  
 Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  
 Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). 
  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the ‚ÄúJournal vs. Conference‚Äù table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. 
  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a ‚Äúdual-track submission.‚Äù   
 The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    
 The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   
 Journal-Only Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  
 When submitting, use the ‚Äúacmtog‚Äù article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 No maximum (or minimum) page length.  
 Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  
   
 Dual-Track Submissions   
 The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    
 The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  
 When submitting, use the ‚Äúacmtog‚Äù article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   
 The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.

 How to Submit  
     
  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the ‚ÄúNew Submission‚Äù tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  
 To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  
 Deadlines   
 All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  
 Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   
 Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  
 Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   
 Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  
 Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   
 Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  
 English Review Service   
 Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.

 Review Process  
     
  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  
 When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  
 Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Submission Policy  
     
  Double Submissions   
 By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  
 Plagiarism   
 A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  
 Anonymity   
 The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  
 Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   
 Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  
 Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  
 Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see ‚ÄúPlagiarism‚Äù  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  
 Citing Own Prior Art   
 When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  
 For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. 
  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled ‚ÄúPrepublication.‚Äù This field is not visible to reviewers. 
  Ethics   
 Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  
 Lobbying Reviewers   
 It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author‚Äôs own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.

 Submission Requirements  
     
  Submission Format   
 Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided ‚Äúacmtog‚Äù LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  
 If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \documentclass command:  
 \documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  
 and add your assigned paper ID with:  
 \acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  
 Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM‚Äôs list of accepted LaTeX packages ‚Äî https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added ‚Äî see the documentation for information on that request process.  
 Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  
 Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the ‚Äúacmart‚Äù class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  
 Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper‚Äôs ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors‚Äô names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  
 Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  
 Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   
 Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the ‚ÄúCiting Own Prior Art‚Äù section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  
 We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers‚Äô discretion.  
 Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the ‚Äúproperties‚Äù of a PDF file may contain the creator‚Äôs name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  
 Paper Length   
 Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  
 Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section ‚ÄúSubmission Format,‚Äù or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  
 The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  
 For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  
 Companion Videos   
 Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper‚Äôs acceptance will be rescinded.  
 Supplemental Materials   
 Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  
 A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  
 B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  
 For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  
 Resubmissions   
 If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  
 Permissions and Copyrights   
 You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  
 Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  
 If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution‚Äôs email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.

 Evaluation  
     
  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  
 The Review Process   
 After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . 
  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. 
  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . 
  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other‚Äôs identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either ‚Äúconditionally accepted‚Äù or ‚Äúrejected.‚Äù If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to ‚Äútable‚Äù the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. 
  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. 
  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. 
  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  
 Possible Outcomes for a Paper   
 Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee‚Äôs decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  
 Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. 
  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. 
  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. 
  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees‚Äô decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author‚Äôs designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.

 Upon Acceptance  
     
  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   
 TAPS is ACM‚Äôs article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one‚Äôs article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver ‚Äúcamera-ready‚Äù materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   
 Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  
 A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the ‚ÄúStage 3 Program Material‚Äù form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  
 The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee‚Äôs job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  
 ORCID Mandate   
 ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  
 You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  
 Papers Fast Forward Session   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  
 In-Person Presentation   
 For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  
 Presenter Recognition   
 Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  
 To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  
 You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  
 Authorization for Use   
 Any material that supports a paper‚Äôs acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the ‚Äúpublic materials that are considered part of the submission‚Äù section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  
 Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system‚Äôs final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  
 Technical Papers Preview Trailer   
 A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  
 ACM Rights Management Form   
 If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  
 Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.

 Rationale   
 The  CCIS  series  is  devoted  to  the  publication  of  proceedings  of  computer  science  con-   
 ferences.  Its  aim  is  to  efÔ¨Åciently  disseminate  original  research  results  in  informatics   
 in  printed  and  electronic  form.  While  the  focus  is  on  publication  of  peer-reviewed  full   
 papers  presenting  mature  work,  inclusion  of  reviewed  short  papers  reporting  on  work  in   
 progress  is  welcome,  too.  Besides  globally  relevant  meetings  with  internationally  repre-   
 sentative  program  committees  guaranteeing  a  strict  peer-re  viewing  and  paper  selection   
 process,  conferences  run  by  societies  or  of  high  regional  or  national  relevance  are  also   
 considered  for  publication.   
 T  opics   
 The  topical  scope  of  CCIS  spans  the  entire  spectrum  of  informatics  ranging  from  foun-   
 dational  topics  in  the  theory  of  computing  to  information  and  communications  science   
 and  technology  and  a  broad  variety  of  interdisciplinary  application  Ô¨Åelds.   
 Information  for  V  olume  Editors  and  A  uthors   
 Publication  in  CCIS  is  free  of  charge.  No  royalties  are  paid,  howev  er,  we  offer  re  gistered   
 conference  participants  temporary  free  access  to  the  online  version  of  the  conference   
 proceedings  on  SpringerLink  ( http://link.springer.com )  by  means  of  an  http  referrer  from     
 the  conference  website  and/or  a  number  of  complimentary  printed  copies,  as  speciÔ¨Åed   
 in  the  ofÔ¨Åcial  acceptance  email  of  the  event.   
 CCIS  proceedings  can  be  published  in  time  for  distribution  at  conferences  or  as  post-   
 proceedings,  and  delivered  in  the  form  of  printed  books  and/or  electronically  as  USBs   
 and/or  e-content  licenses  for  accessing  proceedings  at  SpringerLink.  Furthermore,  CCIS   
 proceedings  are  included  in  the  CCIS  electronic  book  series  hosted  in  the  SpringerLink   
 digital  library  at  http://link.springer.com/bookseries/7899  .  Conferences  publishing  in    
 CCIS  are  allowed  to  use  Online  Conference  Service  (OCS)  for  managing  the  whole   
 proceedings  lifecycle  (from  submission  and  reviewing  to  preparing  for  publication)  free   
 of  charge.   
 Publication  process   
 The  language  of  publication  is  exclusively  English.  Authors  publishing  in  CCIS  hav  e   
 to  sign  the  Springer  CCIS  copyright  transfer  form,  however  ,  they  are  free  to  use  their   
 material  published  in  CCIS  for  substantially  changed,  more  elaborate  subsequent  publi-   
 cations  elsewhere.  For  the  preparation  of  the  camera-ready  papers/Ô¨Åles,  authors  have  to   
 strictly  adhere  to  the  Springer  CCIS  Authors‚Äô  Instructions  and  are  strongly  encouraged   
 to  use  the  CCIS  LaTeX  style  Ô¨Åles  or  templates.   
 Abstracting/Indexing   
 CCIS  is  abstracted/indexed  in  DBLP  ,  Google  Scholar  ,  EI-Compendex,  Mathematical   
 Reviews,  SCImago,  Scopus.  CCIS  volumes  are  also  submitted  for  the  inclusion  in  ISI   
 Proceedings.

 The  International  Conference  on  Innovations  for  Community  Services  (I4CS)  celebrated   
 its  24th  edition  in  2024,  occurring  for  the  second  time  in  The  Netherlands  after  2022.  W  e   
 were  pleased  to  meet  many  fellow  attendees  at  Maastricht  University  in  person  ag  ain.   
 T  wenty-three  years  ago,  at  Ilmenau  University  of  T  echnology  ,  Germany  ,  Herwig   
 Unger  and  Thomas  B√∂hme  called  for  the  W  orkshop  on  Innovativ  e  Internet  Community   
 Systems  (IICS)  as  a  platform  for  project  result  publication.  It  continued  its  success  story   
 under  its  revised  name  I2CS,  then  I4CS  since  2014.  It  published  its  Ô¨Årst  proceedings  in   
 books  of  the  Springer  Lecture  Notes  in  Computer  Science  series  (LNCS)  until  2005,  fol-   
 lowed  by  Gesellschaft  f√ºr  Informatik  (GI)  in  K√∂llen  V  erlag,  and  V  erein  Deutscher  Inge-   
 nieure  (VDI)  in  2013.  I4CS  commenced  with  the  Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics   
 Engineers  (IEEE)  before  it  switched  back  to  Springer‚Äôs  Communications  in  Computer   
 and  Information  Science  (CCIS)  series  in  2016  and  created  a  permanent  partnership   
 in  2018.  The  unique  combination  of  printed  proceedings  and  the  SpringerLink  online   
 edition  generates  high  interest  among  external  readers,  with  more  than  4,300  accesses   
 last  year  from  https://link.springer.com/conference/i4cs  .    
 The  selection  of  conference  locations  reÔ¨Çects  the  conference  concept:  These  are   
 the  members  of  the  Program  Committee  (PC)  who  offer  suitable  locations  to  live  out   
 our  passion  as  a  scientiÔ¨Åc  community.  F  or  2024,  the  I4CS  Steering  Committee  had  the   
 honor  to  hand  over  the  organizational  responsibility  to  Frank  Phillipson  and  to  accept   
 his  invitation  to  his  second  afÔ¨Åliation  after  Delft  tw  o  years  ago.  Located  on  the  banks   
 of  the  River  Maas  and  representing  an  important  location  for  Europe‚Äô  s  history  with   
 the  Maastricht  Treaties,  we  were  near  the  Belgian  and  German  borders,  successfully   
 embodying  this  year‚Äôs  motto,  ‚ÄúCrossing  Digital  Borders‚Äù.   
 W  e  were  proud  to  offer  a  good  selection  of  scientiÔ¨Åc  presentations,  combined  with  a   
 keynote,  two  invited  talks,  and  a  great  social  conference  program  to  strengthen  the  cul-   
 tural  community  spirit.  The  proceedings  of  I4CS  2024  comprise  seven  sessions  that  cover   
 a  selection  of  17  full  papers  and  Ô¨Åve  short  papers  out  of  44  submissions  received  from   
 authors  in  13  countries.  Interdisciplinary  thinking  is  a  key  success  factor  for  any  commu-   
 nity.  Hence,  I4CS  2024  co  vered  several  re  vised  scientiÔ¨Åc,  academic,  social,  and  indus-   
 trial  topics,  clustered  into  our  three  long-lasting  and  well-known  key  areas:  T  echnology,

 Preface   
 W  elcome  to  the  proceedings  of  the  24th  International  Conference  on  Innovations  for   
 Community  Services  (I4CS),  themed  ‚ÄúCrossing  Digital  Borders‚Äù,  held  during  June  12‚Äì   
 14,  2024,  at  Maastricht  University  in  the  city  of  Maastricht,  The  Netherlands.  It  is   
 with  great  pleasure  that  I,  as  Conference  Chair,  introduce  this  CCIS  volume,  featuring   
 cutting-edge  research  and  insights  into  the  dynamic  Ô¨Åeld  of  digital  innovation.   
 In  today‚Äôs  interconnected  world,  the  signiÔ¨Åcance  of  innov  ations  in  community  ser-   
 vices  cannot  be  overstated.  These  innovations  encompass  a  broad  spectrum  of  tech-   
 nologies  and  methodologies  aimed  at  improving  the  well-being  and  quality  of  life  for   
 individuals  and  communities  alike.  From  healthcare  and  education  to  transportation  and   
 public  safety,  community  services  play  a  vital  role  in  shaping  the  fabric  of  society  and   
 fostering  inclusivity  and  equity  .   
 The  choice  of  Maastricht  as  the  venue  for  this  year‚Äôs  conference  holds  special  sig-   
 niÔ¨Åcance.  Maastricht,  a  city  steeped  in  history,  is  reno  wned  for  its  role  in  shaping  the   
 European  Union  through  the  Maastricht  Treaty  ,  signed  here  in  1992.  This  treaty  laid  the   
 foundation  for  closer  European  integration,  emphasizing  cooperation  and  unity  across   
 national  borders.  In  a  similar  vein,  our  conference  theme,  ‚ÄúCrossing  Digital  Borders‚Äù,   
 underscores  the  importance  of  transcending  traditional  boundaries  in  the  digital  realm,   
 whether  they  are  geographical,  technological,  or  societal.   
 In  this  volume,  you  will  Ô¨Ånd  a  diverse  array  of  contrib  utions  spanning  distributed   
 architectures,  software  frameworks,  machine  learning,  cryptography  ,  and  services  fos-   
 tering  digital  communities  and  smart  mobility.  F  ollowing  a  thorough  single-blind  review   
 procedure  by  at  least  three  reviewers  for  each  submission,  the  Program  Committee  of  the   
 I4CS  conference  compiled  an  interesting  scientiÔ¨Åc  program.  It  included  17  full  papers   
 and  Ô¨Åve  short  papers  out  of  44  submissions.  Our  esteemed  keynote  and  invited  speak-   
 ers,  Anna  Wilbik,  Klaus-Dieter  Rest,  and  Rob  van  der  Mei,  ha  ve  delved  into  topics   
 at  the  forefront  of  technological  advancement,  offering  insights  into  responsibility  and   
 explainability  in  automated  systems,  decision  support  for  home  healthcare  services  in   
 urban  regions,  and  for  ambulance  services.  These  topics  not  only  cover  the  proper  use   
 of  what  ICT  can  offer  us  but  also  show  ho  w  we  as  researchers  can  follow  the  path  to   
 proper  valorization  of  the  research  into  startups  and  tooling.   
 Maastricht  University  ,  with  its  reputation  for  excellence  in  research  and  innovation,   
 provided  an  inspiring  backdrop  for  our  discussions  and  deliberations.  The  university‚Äô  s   
 commitment  to  interdisciplinary  collaboration  mirrors  the  ethos  of  our  conference,  where   
 academia,  industry,  and  go  vernment  conver  ge  to  address  the  multifaceted  challenges  of   
 our  digital  age.   
 I  extend  my  heartfelt  gratitude  to  all  members  of  the  Program  Committee  and  external   
 reviewers  for  their  diligent  efforts  in  ensuring  the  quality  and  rigor  of  the  conference  pro-   
 ceedings.  I  am  also  deeply  appreciative  of  the  authors,  speakers,  and  participants  whose   
 contributions  enriched  our  discussions  and  fostered  new  ideas  and  collaborations.  Spe-   
 cial  thanks  are  due  to  Maastricht  University  for  graciously  hosting  our  conference  and  to

 all  those  involved  in  its  or  ganization  and  execution.  Last  but  not  least,  we  ackno  wledge   
 the  support  of  the  EasyChair  conference  system  and  express  our  gratitude  to  its  manage-   
 ment  team,  which  always  serves  the  digital  community  in  an  altruistic  way  .  Furthermore,   
 we  thank  Springer  for  their  technical  support  and  excellent  management  of  our  CCIS   
 publishing  project.   
 As  we  navigate  the  ever  -changing  landscape  of  digital  technology,  let  us  remain   
 steadfast  in  our  commitment  to  exploring  new  frontiers,  transcending  boundaries,  and   
 harnessing  the  power  of  innovation  for  the  betterment  of  our  communities  and  soci-   
 eties,  bringing  together  research  from  universities,  univ  ersities  of  applied  sciences,  and   
 industry.

 Abstract.  Home  Health  Care  (HHC)  services  enable  elderly  and  frail    
 individuals  to  maintain  independence  in  their  familiar  surroundings  while   
 receiving  professional  assistance.  This  work  is  grounded  in  my  disser-   
 tation  and  practical  insights  gained  from  developing  a  commercial  deci-   
 sion  support  tool  used  by  a  major  HHC  service  provider  in  Vienna.  The   
 tool  addresses  the  growing  demand  for  HHC  services  and  aids  in  day-   
 to-day  operations  and  disaster  management.  Vulnerability  analyses  were   
 conducted  to  understand  the  intricate  HHC  system  and  its  susceptibility   
 to  various  disasters,  visualized  through  Causal-Loop  Diagrams  to  iden-   
 tify  cascading  effects  and  feedback  loops.  T  o  assist  HHC  nurses‚Äô  daily   
 planning  in  routine  and  crisis  situations,  a  new  mixed-integer  linear  pro-   
 gram  and  T  abu  Search  metaheuristics  were  developed.  Unlike  pre  vious   
 research  focused  on  rural  areas,  this  work  concentrates  on  urban  set-   
 tings.  The  algorithms  published  cater  to  the  requirements  of  two  major   
 HHC  service  providers  in  Vienna,  encompassing  di  verse  aspects  of  HHC   
 nurse  routing,  including  working  time  regulations,  Ô¨Çexible  breaks,  care   
 consistency  ,  workload  distribution,  and  synchronization.  Unique  features   
 such  as  time-dependent  public  transportation  usage  are  incorporated.   
 The  developed  decision  support  system  is  highly  adaptable,  allowing   
 adjustment  of  planning  based  on  dispatcher  needs  and  preferences,  capa-   
 ble  of  solving  real-world  instances  swiftly.  Extensi  ve  numerical  studies   
 with  real-world  data  demonstrate  substantial  savings  in  travel  and  w  ait   
 times,  as  well  as  reduced  need  for  second  shifts.  Scenario  analyses  were   
 conducted  to  ascertain  operational  limits  during  disasters.

 Abstract.  In  serious,  life-threatening  situations  where  every  second    
 counts,  the  timely  presence  of  emergency  services  can  mean  the  dif-   
 ference  between  survival  and  death.  In  the  Netherlands,  at  least  95%  of   
 high-emergency  calls  should  have  a  response  time  of  less  than  15  min-   
 utes.  In  practice,  this  requirement  is  often  not  met.  Moreover,  due  to  the   
 aging  population,  we  observe  a  steady  growth  in  demand,  while  at  the   
 same  time,  the  tight  job  market  makes  it  hard  to  Ô¨Ånd  sufÔ¨Åcient  ambu-   
 lance  personnel.  These  developments  put  a  tremendous  burden  on  the   
 already-strained  ambulance  system.   
 A  powerful  means  to  boost  the  response-time  performance  of  ambu-   
 lance  services  is  to  implement  so-called  Dynamic  Ambulance  Manage-   
 ment  (DAM).  Basically  ,  DAM  consists  of  two  parts:  (1)  dynamic  dis-   
 patching,  and  (2)  proactive  relocation.  Dynamic  dispatching  in  volves   
 deciding  which  ambulance(s)  to  dispatch  to  a  newly  incoming  incident   
 call,  depending  on  the  locations  and  status  of  the  available  ambulance   
 vehicles.  Proactive  relocation  in  volves  determining  where  and  when  to   
 move  ambulance  vehicles  to  achie  ve  desired  coverage  lev  els  in  real-time.   
 In  the  context  of  DAM,  we  ha  ve  developed  sev  eral  scalable  heuristics   
 to  provide  real-time  decision  support  for  both  dispatching  and  relocation   
 decisions.  For  the  acceptance  of  DAM  in  practice,  there  are  se  veral  prac-   
 tical  constraints:  (1)  the  number  of  relocations  is  limited,  (2)  relocations   
 should  not  be  enforced  on  personnel  just  before  the  end  of  their  shift,   
 and  (3)  the  response-time  performance  should  be  signiÔ¨Åcantly  better  by   
 implementing  DAM  compared  to  the  classical  static  and  reactiv  e  way  of   
 working.   
 T  o  meet  all  these  requirements,  we  have  started  a  real-life  pilot  with   
 an  ambulance  provider  in  the  Netherlands  and  Ô¨Åne-tuned  the  model  based   
 on  feedback  from  practitioners,  such  as  call  center  agents,  drivers,  and   
 emergency  medical  specialists.  In  doing  so,  we  have  included  a  limita-   
 tion  on  the  expected  number  of  relocations  per  day  and  a  parameter  that   
 indicates  the  timeframe  over  which  an  ambulance  is  not  relocated  just   
 before  the  end  of  a  shift.  Last  but  not  least,  our  results  showed  a  great   
 improvement  in  response-time  performance  in  terms  of  the  fraction  of   

 xvi  R.  van  der  Mei   
 late  arrivals,  with  a  strong  reduction  in  late  arri  vals  ultimately  saving   
 lives.   
 As  a  next  step,  we  have  transformed  our  proof-of-concept  D  AM  soft-   
 ware  into  a  stable,  fully  functional  planning  software  package  to  be  used   
 by  ambulance  providers  via  a  licensing  agreement.  The  methods  are  cur-   
 rently  exploited  by  a  spin-off  company  named  Stokhos  Emergenc  y  Math-   
 ematics,  which  is  operational  in  a  large  number  of  safety  regions  in  the   
 Netherlands  and  abroad.

 We invite you to organize a workshop or tutorial for the 20th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2025). HRI is a highly selective conference which aims to showcase the very best HRI research. It has interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary roots in robotics, social psychology, cognitive science, HCI, human factors, artificial intelligence, engineering, and many other disciplines.  
 Each year, the HRI conference highlights a particular theme. For HRI 2025, the theme is ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World‚Äù. We encourage tutorial and workshop proposals to build upon this theme, whether by topic, structure, or ways to engage participants.  
 Organisers may propose for their HRI 2025 tutorial or workshop to be offered fully in-person, or in a hybrid (in-person/remote) fashion. Organisers must commit that at least one organiser will hence attend in person to facilitate the in-person activities. Please note that no conference support will be available for hybrid workshops, organisers wishing to offer a hybrid workshop will be responsible for their own hybrid logistics.  
 Tutorials and workshops will be held in the 1-2 days before the main conference program sessions. Submission instructions for organizers follow below.  
 Workshops   
 Workshops are an opportunity for participants to meet other members of the HRI community, to discuss problems and to present their ideas around a common topic. The workshops can be half-day or full-day, and can cover any topic relevant to HRI research, design, methodologies, or education. Interdisciplinary approaches are particularly welcome.  
 The responsibilities of workshop organizers include:  
 Setting up a website for the workshop that will be linked to the HRI 2025 website. 
  Publicizing the workshop and soliciting position papers from potential participants. 
  Selecting workshop participants based on the quality of their position papers, which outline the submitters‚Äô views on the workshop topic and the reasons for submitters‚Äô interest. 
  Running the in-person workshop at the conference. 
  Optionally, supporting remote participant attendance for a hybrid format (noting that no conference support will be available for this). 
  Optionally, compiling workshop proceedings and/or finding opportunities for formal publication of extended versions of position papers after the workshop. 
  Optionally, soliciting and coordinating the appearance of invited speakers at the workshop. ‚Äã‚ÄãOrganizers who plan on inviting speakers to their tutorial or workshop are encouraged to invite a diverse set of speakers.

 The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction is a premier, highly-selective venue presenting the latest advances in Human-Robot Interaction. The 20th Annual HRI conference theme is ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, behavioral, theoretical, and methodological, that advance fundamental and applied research in human-robot interaction. Full papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Abstracts Submission  
 Please be aware that from this year we require all full papers to submit an abstract and basic details about the paper a week before the paper submission deadline  . Papers that did not submit the abstract on time will not be accepted  .  
 In addition, the abstract, title, and list of authors information that is submitted at that time must be complete  . Submissions for which it is obvious that the information submitted by the abstract deadline is merely a placeholder or incomplete will be deleted.  
 Format and Submission  
 Full papers are up to eight camera-ready pages, including figures, but excluding references  . Accepted full papers will be published in the conference proceedings and presented in an oral session. Submissions longer than eight pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed.  
 The HRI conference is highly selective with a rigorous, two-stage review model that includes an expert program committee meeting where papers are extensively discussed. As such, all submissions are expected to be mature, polished, and detailed accounts of cutting-edge research described and presented in camera-ready style. In cases of equally qualified papers, positive consideration will be given to submissions that address this year‚Äôs theme: ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù  
 All papers for the conference must be submitted in PDF format and conform to IEEE Proceedings specifications. Templates are available at this link  (use US letter format). In addition, the IEEE has partnered with Overleaf, so you can start writing using the this link  directly.  
 Tracks  
 The HRI 2025 full paper submissions will have five tracks:  
 Theory and Methods 
  Design 
  Technical 
  Systems 
  User Studies 
  Each of these tracks is aligned with a specific type of knowledge contribution and each paper will be assigned to one review subcommittee based on the chosen track. Authors are strongly encouraged to read through the tracks descriptions  at the end of this page.  
 You will need to indicate your choice of track (and optionally your second choice) when you submit your paper. However, note that your choice of the paper track may be changed during the initial paper check stage, if that is deemed more appropriate by the Program Committee.  
 Go to Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks  .  
 Accessibility  
 Make sure to read and follow the accessibility requirements described on the accessibility page  .  
 Anonymization  
 The HRI 2025 full papers review process is double-blind; every aspect of all submissions must be properly anonymized. For full details on how to do anonymization, see the anonymization guidelines  . If a submission contains any element (e.g., text or figures in the full paper document, artifacts, or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines, it will be desk rejected. If there are exceptional circumstances, please contact the Program Chairs as soon as possible ( pc2025@humanrobotinteraction.org  ).  
 Theme Recognition: Robots for a Sustainable World  
 This year, we aim to highlight papers that align with and contribute to our conference theme, ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù We acknowledge the multifaceted nature of sustainability and consider it from various perspectives, including but not limited to environmental impact and climate action. We also welcome papers addressing a wide array of issues outlined by the UN Sustainable Development Goals  . These goals include:  
 Social sustainability: emphasizing the importance of inclusive communities where everyone can thrive, promoting equity and social justice. 
  Technological sustainability: stressing the need to think critically about how our innovations impact society and the environment. 
  Economic sustainability: focusing on creating robust economic systems that support innovation and provide fair opportunities for all. 
  Additionally, we value papers that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable research practices. This includes minimizing the environmental footprint of research activities, promoting ethical data collection and usage, and ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in research design.  
 If you think the paper fits the theme and would like it to be considered for a theme recognition ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World‚Äù, when submitting your paper you will have the option to describe in 1-2 short paragraphs why and how your paper relates to sustainability. This includes the impact of your contribution in the context of sustainability and/or the actions you have undertaken to make your work more sustainable.  
 Supplementary Materials  
 Authors have the opportunity to upload up to three supplemental files in conjunction with their full paper submission. These materials may be submitted via the ‚ÄúSupporting File 1,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupporting File 2,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSupporting File 3‚Äù sections within the full papers submission form in the submission system. While authors are encouraged to upload all supplementary materials directly, it may be infeasible to upload certain items directly (e.g., large data sets or code repositories). In this case, authors may upload a document with a link to where these anonymized supplemental materials are hosted.  
 Supplementary materials are not required for a submission. If authors do choose to submit supplementary materials, such materials may not be used to get around the page limit for full papers  . It is important that any supplemental materials that are uploaded are also properly anonymized. Any submission that contains any element (full paper or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 In general, there are three main types of supplemental materials that may be submitted: videos, appendices, and artifacts (e.g., software, hardware, data sets, etc.).  
 Video Guidelines  
 Authors may submit a 1-minute video (up to 100 MB) as a supplement to their full paper. Videos are not mandatory but may be helpful to visibly showcase a working system, experimental conditions, environment context, results, etc. Only MPG, MPEG or MP4 video formats can be used. Ensure that videos are properly anonymized prior to submission (see Anonymization guidelines  ).  
 Accepted full papers with a video in supplementary material will be considered for Demo Fast Track. More details here  .  
 Artifact Guidelines  
 Across all full paper tracks, we encourage submissions that introduce a novel ‚Äúartifact‚Äù as an enabler to reproducibility, replicability, and recreation of HRI research, and/or to support new lines of HRI research. An artifact could be software, hardware, data sets, protocols, new evaluation measures, etc. Submissions should contain a detailed description of the artifact introduced, proposed, or implemented, as well as information about how it is novel and different from other existing artifacts, and, if possible, a link to an anonymized, live version of the artifact at time of submission for review.  
 Authors submitting artifacts must include with it a text file providing relevant details regarding any aspects related to artifact clearance and release (e.g., obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearance for releasing data collected by human participants, organizational clearances for the release of software/hardware, etc.). Ensure that artifacts are properly anonymized prior to submission. Any submission that includes any element (full paper, artifact, or supplementary materials) that does not follow the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 Appendix Guidelines  
 Authors may upload an appendix directly or provide a link to supporting appendix material hosted anonymously online. Appendices are only for supplementary materials that would interrupt the flow of the text if presented in the main document. Examples may be questionnaires used as measurements, tables of supplementary data, or figures of experimental apparatus.  
 Appendices may not be used to get around the 8-page limit for full paper submissions. Additional experimental analysis, additional results, and lengthy text that clarifies aspects of the full paper submission is not appropriate for an appendix (in other words, full paper submissions must stand on their own without requiring further explanation, analysis, or results provided in the appendix). Any submissions that attempt to use appendices or supplementary materials in general in a manner that violates the page limits will be desk rejected.  
 Note that appendices should not be added to the main document (even if the LaTeX template allows it).  
 Studies with Human Participants  
 As a published ACM/IEEE author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , and IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  including ACM‚Äôs new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (Note: ACM has instituted a new policy on research involving human participants and subjects as of August 15, 2021. Please check the above links if your studies involved human participants and subjects).  
 To support building a strong evidence base in HRI, and encourage future reproducibility of published work, all submissions involving studies with human participants clearly outline their methodology regardless of the theme they are submitted to, including:  
 Participant demographics and sampling approach, e.g. gender, ethnicity, etc. (c.f., | de Graaf 2017 | , Section 2.3, recommendations in | Schlesinger et al., 2017 | , and | HCI Gender Guidelines | ) 
  Data collection and analysis methods (c.f., | Paepcke and Takayama 2010 | , Section V) 
  Study environment and context (c.f., | Short et al. 2018 | , Section 3.5) 
  If a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm was used, a detailed description of the robot, wizard, user, etc. (c.f., | Riek 2012 | , Table 2) 
  If a robot was used, a detailed description of the platform, its level of autonomy, capabilities, etc. (c.f., | Beer et al. 2014 | , Figure 5). 
    
 In addition, studies that involve human participants need to include an ethical approval statement. According to the IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  , ‚ÄúAuthors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.‚Äù In the case of child users, in addition to consent from legal carers / parents, authors should describe how they obtained the oral assent from minors. Examples of such statements are ‚Äúthe study was approved by our Institutional Review Board‚Äù or ‚Äúthe study design, the experiment protocol, and the consent forms received approval from the Ethics Committee of our institution‚Äù (note that these statements must be anonymized). Additionally, during paper submission, authors will be asked to declare whether their research involves human participants, and if it does, whether approval from a relevant ethics committee was obtained.  
 We recognize that some researchers may work in jurisdictions where there is no mandated ethical review, or may not have access to an institutional ethics committee. In such cases, we will follow the ACM‚Äôs Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  , which lists a basic set of standards and practices that a research should follow, and states that ‚Äúwhere such research is conducted in countries where no such local governing laws and regulations related to human participant and subject research exist, authors must at a bare minimum be prepared to show compliance with the above detailed principles.‚Äù In addition to the declaration mentioned above, the paper submission form contains also an optional question allowing authors to describe additional context related to human participant protection. If additional explanations regarding institutional review are needed, and in particular if no ethics approval was obtained for the research, the authors should answer this question with enough detail to show that their research was done in full compliance with the ethical research principles stated in the ACM Policy  .  
 Policy on Use of ChatGPT or Similar Models  
 Text, images or any material generated from foundation models (LLMs, VLMs etc.), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author‚Äôs own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post  describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode ‚Äì please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version for review. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Furthermore, HRI follows the ACM Policy on Authorship  . Please carefully review this policy. Any AI system, including Generative Models, such as ChatGPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by ACM and IEEE. Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.  
 Desk rejects  
 Desk rejects are made during the initial checks of submissions to save our reviewers‚Äô time. The main reasons for a desk rejections include:  
 Scope: clearly out of scope for conference (e.g. no relevance to robots or to human-robot interaction). 
  Anonymization: any violation of the rules detailed in the anonymization guidelines 
  Incomplete submissions: missing submission information (including an obviously placeholder title or abstract, etc.). 
  Formatting issues: | paper is breaking the full paper limit (eight pages excluding references); 
  using an incorrect submission format. 
  Other obvious issues, such as paper clearly unfinished, obvious use of foundation models for generating the contents, not written in English, etc. 
  Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks  
 Theory and Methods  
 The primary contribution for the Theory and Methods track is to further the conceptual foundations of HRI. This work helps us to expand upon the ways we think about human-robot interaction (theory) and upon the ways we engage in doing human-robot interaction research (methods). A key benefit of theory and methods work is not only in articulating what we know but there is also generating new ways of seeing the field and posing new questions.  
  Unlike in earlier years, this track will not include reproducibility. Reproducibility studies should be directed to the User Studies track. Theory papers focus on elucidating or connecting fundamental HRI principles beyond individual interfaces or projects, new theoretical concepts in HRI, literature reviews, etc. Such contributions may include meta-analyses of previous findings, narrative or philosophical arguments introducing theoretical or philosophical concepts, detailing underlying interaction paradigms, or providing new interpretations of previously known results.  
 Methods papers may include new ways of studying HRI, with focus on developing novel evaluation methodologies (e.g. new questionnaires), or in the analysis of existing research and methods derived from original or surveyed empirical research.  
 Successful papers in this track will clearly detail how they transform our current fundamental understanding of human-robot interaction and why the work is significant and has potential for impact. As appropriate, work must be defended by clear and sound arguments and a thorough reflective analysis of the contribution with respect to the existing state of the art.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the theory and methods track:  
 To the extent that methods papers might pertain to new metrics or methods of evaluation, they might include studies; however, the focus of the paper would be on evaluating the novelty and contribution of the concepts and methods, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  Theory papers are not expected to have user studies. 
  Methods for generating design belong in the Design track; methods for measuring or studying HRI belong in the Theory and Methods track. Technical methods or tools belong to the Technical track. 
  If the contribution is a clarification or improvement of an existing theory or method, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Chen et al., 2024  , Kim et al, 2024  , Winkle et al., 2023   
 Design  
 The Design track brings together design-centric research contributions to human-robot interaction (HRI). This includes novel design approaches, new robot morphologies, behavior paradigms, interaction techniques, and the exploration of new contexts for interaction that yield unique or improved interaction experiences with or capabilities for robots. The Design track explicitly welcomes papers focusing on design solutions with rigorous detail, as well as papers on design-driven methodologies (e.g., participatory design, critical design, and design for manufacturability) that influence how designers approach HRI design. Research on the design process itself, or proposing new design products, strategies, frameworks, or models relevant to HRI, belongs in the Design track. Submissions must fully describe their design outcomes or processes to enable detailed review and replication of the design process. Further, successful papers will include evaluations appropriate to the work, such as end-user evaluation or a critical reflection on the design process.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the Design track:  
 While there are often studies in the Design track papers, the focus of these studies lies in evaluating novel aspects and features of the design and resulting response or behavior, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  If the main contribution lies in some aspect of the software or hardware capabilities, and less in how the context or use matches the hardware or software, the paper might belong in the Systems track. 
  If the contribution is an implementation or improvement of an existing design, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Koike et al., 2024  , Walker et al., 2024  , Taylor et al., 2024  , Nanavati et al. 2023   
 Technical  
 The primary knowledge contribution of papers submitted to the technical track is expected to be a novel algorithm (formalized through pseudocode), mathematical model (formalized through a set of equations), tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, and should provide enough detail to allow reproducibility. The expectation is that methods will be at an appropriate level of rigor, approaches will be robust, confounding elements will be clearly noted, and evaluations are suitable to the type of contribution; evaluations do not  need to include user studies unless appropriate.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the technical track:  
 If a submitted paper contains a user study to empirically evaluate or demonstrate the primary knowledge contribution, authors should be clear in the paper why this paper is indeed a ‚Äútechnical‚Äù contribution rather than a ‚Äústudies‚Äù contribution. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the integration of disparate hardware or software capabilities, the paper likely belongs in the Systems track; however, if the novelty or main contribution lies in a novel individual component of a possibly integrated system, then the paper is appropriate for the Technical track. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the development of a code-based implementation of an existing technical contribution, rather than the algorithm or model itself, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Technical work may be evaluated in a variety of ways, non-exhaustively including proofs of correctness, proof-of-concept demonstration, evaluation in simulation (for example with an Wizard-of-Oz approach), performance evaluation of a novel sub-system or component, or user study. It is critical to ensure that the claims made by the paper are backed up by the evaluation. This means that while a well designed and appropriate  user study with a deployed robot may be advantageous, it is not necessary. Further, a poorly designed and inappropriate  user study presented in a technical paper may be worse than including no user study at all. However:  
 Authors of submitted papers whose evaluation does not support the paper‚Äôs claims (e.g., strong claims of an algorithm‚Äôs effect backed up only by a proof-of-concept demonstration or an underpowered user study) might be asked to revise their claims. 
  Authors whose paper does not contain a demonstration or study of a physical robot should provide a ‚Äúpathway to deployment‚Äù describing what would need to be done to reach successful deployment onto a physical platform. Such papers will still need either an analytical or computational/empirical evaluation. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Mahadevan et al., 2024  , Tung et al., 2024  , Trinh et al, 2024  , Brawer et al., 2023   
 Systems  
 Because HRI is by its nature an integrative discipline, the Systems track focuses on contributions which consist of a synthesis of underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior. Generally speaking, a Systems paper is one whose contribution is best observed and measured through performance of an integrated system, usually including a robot, rather than through component-level testing. This could involve some combination of novel system design or integration of novel techniques or components to enable new system-level functionality. The contribution of a Systems track paper could include demonstration of the usefulness of a component or technique in the larger system, achievement of new system-level capabilities, or enhanced system performance. Whether it belongs in these categories or others, authors should emphasize the novelty and significance of their contribution. In particular, authors should highlight what wider systems knowledge, best practices, lessons learned, etc. can be derived from their work and applied to future HRI problems. Papers‚Äô evaluations should be appropriate to the systems contribution being presented, potentially including demonstrations based on scenarios or case-studies, user studies, or technical performance evaluations. Similar to the Technical track, a well-designed  user study can help support a paper‚Äôs claims, but is not strictly necessary for acceptance.  
 Please note that:  
 If the | primary | contribution of a paper is an algorithm or a mathematical model, or is best measured via component-level testing rather than a systems-level evaluation, then the paper likely belongs to the Technical track; 
  If the paper‚Äôs contribution is about presenting a study to better understanding human behavior or preferences rather than system-level behavior based on integration, the paper may belong to the User Studies track; 
  If the contribution is limited to a description of a system design or dataset, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Padmanabha et al., 2024  , Jenamani et al, 2024  , Bouzida et al., 2024  , Schoen et al., 2023   
 User Studies  
 The primary contribution of papers submitted to the studies track is expected to be new knowledge about human-robot interactions, based on a study conducted with people. These studies may take a variety of forms, including laboratory or field studies; other ethnographic and qualitative studies; exploratory, theory-building, or replicative studies; industry case studies, and so forth. These studies may use autonomous robots, Wizard of Oz, or may not involve a physical robot at all. In addition, like last year, reproducibility studies are included in this track. What is most important is the size of the knowledge contribution produced through this study for the human-robot interaction community. Because the primary knowledge contribution in this track is expected to be knowledge from a study with humans:  
 If a submitted paper contains evaluation of an implemented system, it should be clear why the insights from the study with humans are the primary knowledge contribution rather than the system itself, and thus, why the paper belongs in the Studies rather than Technical or Systems track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the creation of a new survey measure or other scientific tools, the paper likely belongs in the Theory and Methods track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is a design process, or the description of a series of design steps used to design a robotic system, then the paper likely belongs in the Design track. For example, if an author performs a series of co-design workshops, the resulting paper would belong in the User Studies track if the contribution of the paper focused on the scientific insights gleaned from the analysis of those workshops, but would belong in the Design track if the contribution of the paper focused on the quality of the design process itself. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the dataset rather than the experimental results themselves, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners from previous years): Pelikan et al., 2024  , Kamino et al., 2024  , Zhanatkyzy et al., 2023  , Ligthart et al., 2022

  Overview of Submission Types  
 There are many ways to contribute to the HRI conference, though the most common is to submit a paper of some new work or research you have done. The work is then evaluated by a group of experts (peer review process) and, if accepted, you‚Äôll have the opportunity to present it in a short talk, poster, video, demo, etc. at the conference.  This guide will give you a quick understanding of the different ways you can present your work at HRI.  
 Mature research work is often submitted as a Full Paper  to the HRI conference. In terms of quality and rigor, full papers are similar to a journal publication in other fields. The papers typically present the outcome of several months or years of hard work. They are anonymous submissions and are thoroughly peer reviewed in a two-stage process that includes an opportunity for authors to respond to the reviewers‚Äô comments before a final decision is made on the paper (rebuttal). You can submit your work under one of several specific tracks (see details on the Full Paper page  ) to ensure that you get the most qualified reviewers for your submission. Accepted Full Papers are published in the main conference proceedings.  
 Another way of contributing to the HRI conference is by submitting a Short Contribution  . The aim of Short Contribution papers is to promote the sharing, reuse, and replication of existing scientific work by submitting datasets or code related to human-robot interaction or by reporting on a replication study. The Short Contributions follow a rigorous review process and are published in the main conference proceedings.  
 If you‚Äôve been working on something you consider especially thought-provoking, controversial or methodologically unusual or risk-taking, you may want to think about writing an alt.HRI  contribution. The subject matter of alt.HRI papers often cuts across HRI themes and the discussion that alt.HRI papers generate can be considered as important as the paper itself. The alt.HRI papers are of similar rigor, quality and length as Full Papers.  
 In addition to the above paper types, the HRI conference has a Late Breaking Reports  track. This is a chance to write up your early research and present it as a Poster at the conference. This is usually a smaller contribution than a Full Paper and a great way to get feedback at the HRI conference.  
 Finally, there are a few other venues through which you can present HRI work at the conference:  
 If you‚Äôve done a great movie about your work, submit it to our | Video | category and get a chance to win a special prize! 
  If you want to submit a specialized installation of some kind or want to show your robot in action, then you should submit to | Demonstrations | . If you‚Äôre a startup looking for a place to show off your robotic system or related software: this could also be a great place to advertise your work or products. 
  Our | Student Design Competition | is an opportunity to submit a novel, wacky, crazy, alternative or bizarre work which doesn‚Äôt fit into any other place. 
  Workshops | are a great way to find your peer group! Let‚Äôs say you are interested in a specific topic, such as personal care robots for older adults or appearance design for robots ‚Äî and you want to meet others with the same interest. Find a few people with similar interests at other institutions or companies. Even for startups trying to find your lead users or people pushing the boundaries of your field, workshops can be a great way to find those people. Workshops can be half or full-day, and attract about 10-25 people. They‚Äôre collaborative events, about meeting new people and presenting early work in a field: if you want to teach people how to do something, then that‚Äôs a | Tutorial | . 
  If you are a student in HRI, the Pioneers Workshop  provides a great venue to present your work and meet with other students.

 The Thirty-Seventh Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-25)  
 Collocated with AAAI-25  
 Submission Site   
 The Thirty-Seventh Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-25) is a venue for papers describing highly innovative realizations of AI technology. The objective of the conference is to showcase successful applications and novel uses of AI. The conference will use technical papers, best practice papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI and the discourse on the actual deployment of AI in practice. The general goal of the conference is to teach people the challenges and solutions to accomplishing something useful in the real world, as opposed to describing a new algorithm. Papers focusing on algorithmic descriptions, rather than applications, are more appropriate for AAAI-25. All submissions must be original.  
 IAAI-25 will consider: (1) papers that showcase novel, deployed applications of AI; (2) applications on a trajectory to deployment; (3) papers that present deployed tools for faster AI solutions development and deployment; (4) papers that showcase original ways of integrating methodologies from different areas of AI for practical realization and future deployment; and (5) papers that analyze the factors related to AI incidents and the best practices for preventing or mitigating their recurrence.  
 Tracks and Topics  
 1. Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI‚Äã   
 Papers submitted to this track must describe *deployed* applications with measurable benefits that include an innovative use of AI technology. Applications are defined as deployed once they are in production use by their final end-users and the in-use experience can be meaningfully collected and reported. The study may evaluate either a stand-alone application or a component of a complex system.  
 Papers will be judged by the quality of: the task or problem description; the application description; the innovative use of AI technology; the measurable application use and payoff; and the lessons learned during application development, deployment and maintenance. In-depth descriptions of the algorithm are generally more appropriate for AAAI than for IAAI. Each accepted deployed application paper will receive the IAAI ‚ÄòInnovative Application‚Äô Award.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 8 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 2. Emerging Applications of AI   
 Emerging applications papers ‚Äòbridge the gap‚Äô between basic AI research and case studies of deployed AI applications, by discussing efforts to apply AI tools, techniques, or methods to real-world problems in novel ways. Emerging applications focus on aspects of AI applications that are not yet sufficiently deployed to be submitted as case studies in the Deployed track.  
 This track is distinguished from reports of purely scientific AI research appropriate for AAAI in that the objective of the efforts reported at IAAI should be the potential application of AI technologies, including engineering considerations. A key requirement for papers is to discuss the path forward for achieving deployment of the technology.  
 Papers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: significance (of the problem, and the tool or methodology); relevance of AI technology to the problem; innovation; path to deployment; content; evaluation; technical quality; and clarity. Authors are advised to bear these questions in mind while writing their papers. Authors are also advised to consider the novelty of applying AI to the particular problem domain.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 3. Deployed Innovative Tools for Enabling AI Applications   
 Within this track, we solicit papers describing *deployed* tools for improving applied AI innovation and deployment of AI systems. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Process organization: Tools that help manage and assure the development, evaluation or deployment of AI systems. 
  Data cleaning: Tools to ease the pain point of processing raw data for its use in AI systems. 
  Modelling: Tools that facilitate AI modelling, for example approaches to facilitate deriving models from examples or demonstrations. 
  Meta-algorithmics: Tools to improve AI systems, algorithm configurators, algorithm portfolios, and hyper-parameter tuners. 
  Platforms: Tools in the form of platforms designed for AI research, especially those with connections to real world systems and domains. 
  Novel computational models: Tools to exploit new computational hardware, for example neuromorphic co-processors, quantum computers, and chips approximating quantum computation. 
  Interaction: Tools that facilitate the interaction design of or user experience with AI systems, or improve user evaluations. 
  Trusted AI: Tools that generate explanations, justifications, and persuasions for data-driven models. 
  Papers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: the extent to which the tool presented yields solutions with demonstrated improved quality; lower development, deployment and maintenance costs; better productivity; fewer errors; and higher ability to scale. Reviewers will pay attention to how well designed is the tool, how easy is it to use and how well is it documented, and how many users it has. Note the focus is on the tool, not on foundational research.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 4. Innovative Inter-disciplinary AI Integration   
 This track is devoted to the integration of AI components with the focus on how the orchestration of methods from different AI silos requires the adaptation of existing technologies to allow them to work together well for application of AI in practice. Papers must pay attention to engineering considerations and, where relevant, to human‚Äìcomputer interaction.  
 Examples for such orchestrated new capabilities and applications include but are not limited to:  
 Learning search algorithms: Implementations of systematic and heuristic search algorithms that are capable to improve their performance by learning from experience or during search. 
  Decision support under uncertainty: Implementations that combine statistical and deterministic reasoning to provide scalable decision support under uncertainty for applications that are inherently stochastic. 
  Knowledge representation: Representations that work effectively for downstream analytics, e.g., the innovative use of a knowledge graph for feature generation of a downstream machine learning model. 
  Auto-configuration: The adaptation of search methods from combinatorial optimization to optimize knowledge bases or to design superior forecasting algorithms. 
  Other research prototypes that integrate algorithms and methods from traditionally different AI sub-communities. 
  A clear, transparent, and reproducible case must be presented that allows the community to judge objectively the value of the innovation of the integration when compared to existing or ad-hoc approaches. Computational experiments on benchmarks (that either already are or will be made public) and in comparison with existing state-of-the-art baseline methods are expected. At least a portion of the experiments is expected to consider real-world (not synthetic generated) benchmarks to demonstrate the practical importance of the problem studied.  
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.  
 5. AI Incidents and Best Practices   
 In this final short paper track, we encourage papers analyzing the factors related to AI incidents and the best practices for preventing or mitigating their recurrence. These papers will be reviewed based on different criteria than the longer papers of the main IAAI tracks. The papers must (a) analyze the development and deployment processes and artifacts in relation to harms realized in the real world for one or more AI incidents, (b) analyze AI incident trends to understand where there are open problems in the deployment of AI systems, and/or (c) detail best practices in producing and deploying systems to prevent or mitigate AI incidents.  
 Papers will be reviewed by a program committee of AI, human factors, safety, and ethics researchers with a particular focus on whether the paper informs the safe practice of deploying intelligent systems in the world. All papers will be added to the AI Incident Database for the referenced AI incidents.  
 Papers in this track may be up to (6) pages long in the prescribed AAAI style. Papers of at most two (2) pages may also be submitted and considered exclusively for presentation as a poster. At most one additional page beyond the limits may contain only references.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Electronic submissions are required. Papers must be in trouble-free, high resolution PDF format and formatted for United States letter (8.5‚Äù x 11‚Äù) paper. Submissions need to be in AAAI two-column format (use the CameraReady templates in the AAAI 2025 Author Kit  ). Deployed papers can be up to eight (8) pages plus one more page containing only references. Emerging, Tools and Integration papers can be up to six (6) pages plus one more page containing only references. Best practice, Challenge, and Training papers may be up to (6) pages long, plus one more page containing only references. Papers of at most two (2) pages, plus one more page containing only references, may also be submitted and considered exclusively for presentation as a poster.  
 Supplementary material in the form of (1) technical appendix, (2) multimedia, (3) code and data may be submitted alongside all papers. The main submission may reference the supplementary material but should be self-contained. Reviewers will be instructed to make their acceptance evaluations based on the main submission and will not be obliged to consult the supplementary material.  
 Submissions to IAAI-25 should contain identifying information of the authors and their affiliations: reviewing is single-blind. It is also recommended to add authors from the deploying institutions as co-authors to show the real-world impact of the submission.  
 Authors should register on the IAAI-25 OpenReview paper submission site. The IAAI-25 OpenReview site will be open for paper submission on July 15, 2024. Authors must then submit a formatted electronic version of their full paper through OpenReview no later than September 2, 2024  . We cannot accept papers submitted by email or fax. Submissions received after the deadline, or that do not meet the length or formatting requirements detailed above, will not be accepted for review. Notification of receipt of the electronic paper will be emailed to the first author (or designated contact author) soon after receipt. By submitting a paper to IAAI, the authors agree that the Program Chairs have the final decision on the acceptance of publication at the conference. Papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee and notification of acceptance or rejection will be emailed to the contact author on October 31, 2024  . The author feedback window will be November 18-22, 2024  . The notification of the final acceptance or rejection will be December 2, 2024  . PDFs of accepted papers will be due on December 19, 2024  . Authors will be required to transfer copyright at that time.  
 All submissions must be original. IAAI-25 will not consider any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Once submitted to IAAI-25, authors may not submit the paper elsewhere during IAAI‚Äôs review period. These restrictions apply only to refereed journals and conferences, not to preliminary versions that are posted as preprints to arXiv.org or other unrefereed forums, or to workshops with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. Authors must confirm that their submissions to IAAI conform to these requirements at the time of submission.

 Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference (IAAI)  
  January 29, 2023   
  
 Sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence  
 Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conferences (IAAI) traditionally consist of case studies of deployed applications with measurable benefits whose value depends on the use of AI technology. In addition, many IAAI conferences augment these case studies with papers and invited talks that address emerging areas of AI technology or applications. IAAI is organized as an independent program within the AAAI National Conference, with schedules coordinated to allow attendees to move freely between IAAI and AAAI Conference sessions. IAAI and the National Conference often jointly sponsor invited talks that fit the theme of both programs  
 Future Conferences  
 The Thirty-Seventh Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence  will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. IAAI-25 is co-located with AAAI-25. Check back shortly for additional details.

 The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction is a premier, highly-selective venue presenting the latest advances in Human-Robot Interaction. The conference theme for HRI 2025 is ‚ÄúRobots for a sustainable world‚Äù and will focus on contributions that aim to bring HRI out of the lab and into everyday life. This year‚Äôs HRI conference will feature three types of short contributions (4 pages, excluding references) focused on datasets, code, and replication studies. These short contributions aim t  
 Advance the sharing and reuse of scientific data and code. 
  Promote wider sharing, reuse, and replication of existing scientific work. 
  Provide additional credit and recognition to authors involved in the production, sharing, and reuse of datasets, code, open science, and replication. 
   
  Similar to the HRI Full papers, HRI Short Contributions will be fully and rigorously reviewed, and will be archived in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.  
 Submission Categories  
 To facilitate quality reviewing, and to inform reviewer selection, authors will be required to select a submission category for their short contribution.  
 These categories are:  
 Data 
  Code 
  Replication 
  Review Process  
 Submissions should be in a double-blind format. Reviewers will assess submissions based on the criteria associated with each type of submission (accessibility, completeness, utility, and relevance).  
 When making your submission, please note that all authors will be required to review at least one submission as well as to provide a list of three recommended potential reviewers.  
 For code and data submissions, please also attach your anonymized  code / data as a zip file and submit as supplementary material. The deadlines for the supplementary material is the same as the paper deadlines. Accepted short contributions papers with a video in supplementary material will be considered for Demo Fast Track. More details here  .  
 Common Anonymization Guidelines   
 When anonymizing your code or data, make sure to carefully check that your licenses, documentation, readme, code / data comments etc. do not contain any identifiable information. Papers will be desk-rejected if anonymization rules are violated. Check here for more in-detail information regarding general anonymization guidelines.   
 Some codebases may already exist in repositories such as Github etc. For those cases, here are some helpful tools to easily anonymize your existing code or data:  
 Anonymous Github (view-only link): | https://anonymous.4open.science/ | . 
  OSF (view-only link): | https://help.osf.io/article/201-create-a-view-only-link-for-a-project | . 
  Dataverse (private URL): | https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/dataset-management.html#private-url-to-review-unpublished-dataset | . 
  Zenodo and figshare: | https://github.com/dgraziotin/disclose-data-dbr-first-then-opendata | . 
   
  However, note that we will not accept any digital links of anonymized code primarily because some links are view-only. Please download your anonymized code and submit as supplementary zip files because our reviewers may need to ensure that they can run the code by following the instructions in the README file. The same applies for data submissions. If your dataset is too big to upload, please zip a representative sample for reviewers to check.  
  Data Submissions  
 Data submissions are short papers that provide access to and detailed descriptions of research data that is of value to the HRI community. These submissions may include both qualitative and quantitative data collected in HRI settings. Data that has already been published as a part of a previous publication may not be included.  
 During initial submission, data should be submitted as a supplementary zip file. If the dataset is too large, a representative sample should be submitted.  
 During final camera-ready submission, regardless of the type of data published, all datasets should be freely and publicly available via a digital repository. Appropriate repositories must be:  
 Supported by and recognized within the HRI community. 
  Provide permanent identifies for submitted databases (e.g., accession numbers, DOIs). 
  Provide metadata and other documentation to support the use and reuse of data in a given archive. 
  Ensure Implement or be working toward implementing the | FAIR principles | (see recommended databases below) | of datasets and associated documentation. 
  Allow access to data without unnecessary restrictions or, when necessary restrictions are in place, provide clear criteria for access and timely mechanisms of access. 
  Recommended databases  that meet this criteria include: Zenodo   ( preferred  ), Dataverse  , Dryad  , Figshare  , Mendeley Data  , and Science Data Bank  .  
 ‚ö†Ô∏è Note  ‚ö†Ô∏è: For datasets containing human-subjects data  authors should specify how subjects were selected, what consent processes were followed, how data sharing was communicated, and specification of any additional ethical considerations. It is also important to clearly indicate ethical board (e.g. IRB) approval for the data collected and approval for data sharing or, where no board was involved, clearly to state this fact. Furthermore anonymity of subjects should be ensured with any sensitive or identifying information removed or embargoed pending regulatory approval. In such cases the presence of this information should be reflected but the actual information/data/transcript segments themselves should be blacked out or removed.  
 Submissions will be assessed by reviewers  on the basis of completeness  , utility, and relevance  .  
 Completeness | : Successful submissions should include a clear licensing, and maintenance plan. Recommended licenses are visible | here | . Sufficient detail must be provided on how the data was collected and organized, what kind of information it contains, how it should be used ethically and responsibly, as well as how it will be made available and | maintained | . Where applicable established best practices on reproducibility should be cited and conformed to. For cases where questionnaires were used, individual questionnaire items and scoring should be provided. 
  Utility and relevance | : Data submissions should highlight how the dataset in question has the potential to influence future work or practice in the HRI domain. 
  We encourage datasets submissions to outline the steps required to reproduce their data both in the collection, post-processing, and usage stages of the data creation process. This should include references code where possible.   
 For eligible data submissions it is recommended that you provide some form of data visualization illustrating aspects of importance or note related to the submitted dataset.   
 Given the variety of possible dataset submissions, a single format for submissions that encompasses all possible submissions is not feasible but authors should use the recommended template for HRI submissions as outlined on the conference website and visible here  .  
 For authors new to data submissions or seeking additional guidance the sections and structure below is advised but not required:  
 Title | (recommended length 110 characters or fewer). 
  Abstract | (maximum 170 words). 
  Study Overview: | This section provides an overview of the study generating the data and its potential use. It should also include a brief summaries of previous publications utilizing the data where applicable. 
  Methods: | The Methods section describes the steps taken to produce the data, including the experimental design used, data acquisition, and computational processing where implemented. It may also cover questionnaire details and their deployment, citing existing works and providing items where applicable. 
  Dataset: | This section explains the dataset associated with the work, including data maintenance, and a detailed overview of file formats. It includes links to supplemental documentation. 
  Usage Notes: | This section provides instructions for researchers using the data, addressing ethical considerations and responsible use guidelines where applicable. It highlights the data‚Äôs utility and relevance to the HRI community, along with a summary of more detailed documentation. 
  References | (IEEE Format). 
  In specific cases (e.g. dataset with privacy-sensitive data), a complete dataset might not be directly downloadable. In this case, the authors must outline in their submission reasonable steps for other researchers to access any aspects of the data that cannot be made openly available (e.g. ask for specific ethical approval).  
 ‚ö†Ô∏è Note  ‚ö†Ô∏è: Dataset which cannot be shared due to intellectual property issues (including using proprietary licensing) cannot be submitted.  
 Relation to existing HRI themes  
 Data submissions can be submitted to the HRI Technical Advances track already. However, this track has a narrower focus, offering an avenue to present and publish datasets that would be useful/important to the community as standalone contributions.  
  Code Submissions  
 Code submissions are short papers that provide access to and detailed descriptions of different code, tools, and software that is of value to the HRI community. These submissions may include both software, analysis code, and other digital tools of use to the HRI community. Code that has already been published as a part of a previous publication may not be included.  
 During initial submission, code should be submitted as a supplementary zip file.  
 During final camera-ready submission, regardless of the type of code published, all code submissions should be made freely and publicly available via a digital repository at the time of submission. Appropriate repositories must be:  
 Supported by and recognized within the HRI community. 
  Provide metadata and other | documentation | to support the use, reuse, and potential modification of code in a given repository. 
  Ensure | long term preservation | of code and associated documentation. 
  Allow access to the code without unnecessary restrictions or, when necessary restrictions are in place, provide clear criteria for access and timely mechanisms of access. 
  Recommended databases that meet this criteria include: Github  ( preferred  ), Zenodo  ( preferred  ), Dataverse  , Dryad  , Figshare  , Mendeley Data  , and Science Data Bank  .  
 Within these repositories the following must be present:  
 Compiled standalone software and/or source code. 
  A clear open-source license for the code or software submitted (see | here | ). 
  A small ‚Äì simulated or real ‚Äì dataset to demo the software/code (where applicable). 
  A | readme | file that contains: | System requirements | : | All software dependencies and operating systems (including version numbers).

  Demo | : | Instructions for the demo or demo video of the code. 
  Expected output (where appropriate). 
  Instructions for use | : | How to run the software or code. 
  We strongly recommend that you ask colleagues that are not familiar with the code or software to test it prior to submission.   
 Compatibility with at least one common and accessible hardware-software platform is required. The platform must be in common use by the HRI community (e.g.,Software platforms such as Ubuntu and ROS versions, Windows 10/11, macOS versions, etc., Languages such as Python, C++, MATLAB, R etc.). If reviewers cannot run your software/code (either due to lack of clear instructions or using outdated software) then it cannot be assessed along the required criteria and may be rejected.  
 Software manuscripts will not be considered under the following circumstances:  
 They require access to databases or other resources whose persistence is not guaranteed (e.g., individual laboratory databases without funding support). 
  Running the software depends on proprietary or otherwise unobtainable ancillary software or hardware. 
  Submissions will be assessed by reviewers  on the basis of completeness  , utility, and relevance  .

   Replication Studies  
 Replication studies report on reproducing previous published results, positive or negative. The authors should provide a clear and detailed description of the methods for another researcher to closely replicate the experimental procedures and results. The authors should use the HRI paper template but adapt the sections to clearly outline the following:  
 What is the scope of reproducibility of the paper? 
  What were the methods? 
  What were the results? 
  Were you successful in reproducing the results? If not, what could be the plausible reasons? 
  What was easy to replicate? 
  What was difficult / unclear where the authors may have made some assumptions? 
  Was there any attempt to contact the authors of the original submission that is being replicated? 
  Reviewers of these submissions will be asked to focus on the level of clarity and details on the above mentioned criteria and prioritize scientific rigor and importance of the replicated study/results to HRI as a field.  
 Relation to Full paper HRI themes  
 Replication studies which significantly expand onto the original research (e.g., add a new condition) and warrant a full-length paper should instead be submitted as a regular full paper.

 The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction is a premier, highly-selective venue presenting the latest advances in Human-Robot Interaction. The 20th Annual HRI conference theme is ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, behavioral, theoretical, and methodological, that advance fundamental and applied research in human-robot interaction. Full papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Abstracts Submission  
 Please be aware that from this year we require all full papers to submit an abstract and basic details about the paper a week before the paper submission deadline  . Papers that did not submit the abstract on time will not be accepted  .  
 In addition, the abstract, title, and list of authors information that is submitted at that time must be complete  . Submissions for which it is obvious that the information submitted by the abstract deadline is merely a placeholder or incomplete will be deleted.  
 Format and Submission  
 Full papers are up to eight camera-ready pages, including figures, but excluding references  . Accepted full papers will be published in the conference proceedings and presented in an oral session. Submissions longer than eight pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed.  
 The HRI conference is highly selective with a rigorous, two-stage review model that includes an expert program committee meeting where papers are extensively discussed. As such, all submissions are expected to be mature, polished, and detailed accounts of cutting-edge research described and presented in camera-ready style. In cases of equally qualified papers, positive consideration will be given to submissions that address this year‚Äôs theme: ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù  
 All papers for the conference must be submitted in PDF format and conform to IEEE Proceedings specifications. Templates are available at this link  (use US letter format). In addition, the IEEE has partnered with Overleaf, so you can start writing using the this link  directly.  
 Tracks  
 The HRI 2025 full paper submissions will have five tracks:  
 Theory and Methods 
  Design 
  Technical 
  Systems 
  User Studies 
  Each of these tracks is aligned with a specific type of knowledge contribution and each paper will be assigned to one review subcommittee based on the chosen track. Authors are strongly encouraged to read through the tracks descriptions  at the end of this page.  
 You will need to indicate your choice of track (and optionally your second choice) when you submit your paper. However, note that your choice of the paper track may be changed during the initial paper check stage, if that is deemed more appropriate by the Program Committee.  
 Go to Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks  .  
 Accessibility  
 Make sure to read and follow the accessibility requirements described on the accessibility page  .  
 Anonymization  
 The HRI 2025 full papers review process is double-blind; every aspect of all submissions must be properly anonymized. For full details on how to do anonymization, see the anonymization guidelines  . If a submission contains any element (e.g., text or figures in the full paper document, artifacts, or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines, it will be desk rejected. If there are exceptional circumstances, please contact the Program Chairs as soon as possible ( pc2025@humanrobotinteraction.org  ).  
 Theme Recognition: Robots for a Sustainable World  
 This year, we aim to highlight papers that align with and contribute to our conference theme, ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World.‚Äù We acknowledge the multifaceted nature of sustainability and consider it from various perspectives, including but not limited to environmental impact and climate action. We also welcome papers addressing a wide array of issues outlined by the UN Sustainable Development Goals  . These goals include:  
 Social sustainability: emphasizing the importance of inclusive communities where everyone can thrive, promoting equity and social justice. 
  Technological sustainability: stressing the need to think critically about how our innovations impact society and the environment. 
  Economic sustainability: focusing on creating robust economic systems that support innovation and provide fair opportunities for all. 
  Additionally, we value papers that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable research practices. This includes minimizing the environmental footprint of research activities, promoting ethical data collection and usage, and ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in research design.  
 If you think the paper fits the theme and would like it to be considered for a theme recognition ‚ÄúRobots for a Sustainable World‚Äù, when submitting your paper you will have the option to describe in 1-2 short paragraphs why and how your paper relates to sustainability. This includes the impact of your contribution in the context of sustainability and/or the actions you have undertaken to make your work more sustainable.  
 Supplementary Materials  
 Authors have the opportunity to upload up to three supplemental files in conjunction with their full paper submission. These materials may be submitted via the ‚ÄúSupporting File 1,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupporting File 2,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSupporting File 3‚Äù sections within the full papers submission form in the submission system. While authors are encouraged to upload all supplementary materials directly, it may be infeasible to upload certain items directly (e.g., large data sets or code repositories). In this case, authors may upload a document with a link to where these anonymized supplemental materials are hosted.  
 Supplementary materials are not required for a submission. If authors do choose to submit supplementary materials, such materials may not be used to get around the page limit for full papers  . It is important that any supplemental materials that are uploaded are also properly anonymized. Any submission that contains any element (full paper or supplementary materials) that violates the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 In general, there are three main types of supplemental materials that may be submitted: videos, appendices, and artifacts (e.g., software, hardware, data sets, etc.).  
 Video Guidelines  
 Authors may submit a 1-minute video (up to 100 MB) as a supplement to their full paper. Videos are not mandatory but may be helpful to visibly showcase a working system, experimental conditions, environment context, results, etc. Only MPG, MPEG or MP4 video formats can be used. Ensure that videos are properly anonymized prior to submission (see Anonymization guidelines  ).  
 Accepted full papers with a video in supplementary material will be considered for Demo Fast Track. More details here  .  
 Artifact Guidelines  
 Across all full paper tracks, we encourage submissions that introduce a novel ‚Äúartifact‚Äù as an enabler to reproducibility, replicability, and recreation of HRI research, and/or to support new lines of HRI research. An artifact could be software, hardware, data sets, protocols, new evaluation measures, etc. Submissions should contain a detailed description of the artifact introduced, proposed, or implemented, as well as information about how it is novel and different from other existing artifacts, and, if possible, a link to an anonymized, live version of the artifact at time of submission for review.  
 Authors submitting artifacts must include with it a text file providing relevant details regarding any aspects related to artifact clearance and release (e.g., obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearance for releasing data collected by human participants, organizational clearances for the release of software/hardware, etc.). Ensure that artifacts are properly anonymized prior to submission. Any submission that includes any element (full paper, artifact, or supplementary materials) that does not follow the anonymization guidelines will be desk rejected.  
 Appendix Guidelines  
 Authors may upload an appendix directly or provide a link to supporting appendix material hosted anonymously online. Appendices are only for supplementary materials that would interrupt the flow of the text if presented in the main document. Examples may be questionnaires used as measurements, tables of supplementary data, or figures of experimental apparatus.  
 Appendices may not be used to get around the 8-page limit for full paper submissions. Additional experimental analysis, additional results, and lengthy text that clarifies aspects of the full paper submission is not appropriate for an appendix (in other words, full paper submissions must stand on their own without requiring further explanation, analysis, or results provided in the appendix). Any submissions that attempt to use appendices or supplementary materials in general in a manner that violates the page limits will be desk rejected.  
 Note that appendices should not be added to the main document (even if the LaTeX template allows it).  
 Studies with Human Participants  
 As a published ACM/IEEE author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , and IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  including ACM‚Äôs new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (Note: ACM has instituted a new policy on research involving human participants and subjects as of August 15, 2021. Please check the above links if your studies involved human participants and subjects).  
 To support building a strong evidence base in HRI, and encourage future reproducibility of published work, all submissions involving studies with human participants clearly outline their methodology regardless of the theme they are submitted to, including:  
 Participant demographics and sampling approach, e.g. gender, ethnicity, etc. (c.f., | de Graaf 2017 | , Section 2.3, recommendations in | Schlesinger et al., 2017 | , and | HCI Gender Guidelines | ) 
  Data collection and analysis methods (c.f., | Paepcke and Takayama 2010 | , Section V) 
  Study environment and context (c.f., | Short et al. 2018 | , Section 3.5) 
  If a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm was used, a detailed description of the robot, wizard, user, etc. (c.f., | Riek 2012 | , Table 2) 
  If a robot was used, a detailed description of the platform, its level of autonomy, capabilities, etc. (c.f., | Beer et al. 2014 | , Figure 5). 
    
 In addition, studies that involve human participants need to include an ethical approval statement. According to the IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policies  , ‚ÄúAuthors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.‚Äù In the case of child users, in addition to consent from legal carers / parents, authors should describe how they obtained the oral assent from minors. Examples of such statements are ‚Äúthe study was approved by our Institutional Review Board‚Äù or ‚Äúthe study design, the experiment protocol, and the consent forms received approval from the Ethics Committee of our institution‚Äù (note that these statements must be anonymized). Additionally, during paper submission, authors will be asked to declare whether their research involves human participants, and if it does, whether approval from a relevant ethics committee was obtained.  
 We recognize that some researchers may work in jurisdictions where there is no mandated ethical review, or may not have access to an institutional ethics committee. In such cases, we will follow the ACM‚Äôs Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  , which lists a basic set of standards and practices that a research should follow, and states that ‚Äúwhere such research is conducted in countries where no such local governing laws and regulations related to human participant and subject research exist, authors must at a bare minimum be prepared to show compliance with the above detailed principles.‚Äù In addition to the declaration mentioned above, the paper submission form contains also an optional question allowing authors to describe additional context related to human participant protection. If additional explanations regarding institutional review are needed, and in particular if no ethics approval was obtained for the research, the authors should answer this question with enough detail to show that their research was done in full compliance with the ethical research principles stated in the ACM Policy  .  
 Policy on Use of ChatGPT or Similar Models  
 Text, images or any material generated from foundation models (LLMs, VLMs etc.), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author‚Äôs own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post  describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode ‚Äì please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version for review. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Furthermore, HRI follows the ACM Policy on Authorship  . Please carefully review this policy. Any AI system, including Generative Models, such as ChatGPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by ACM and IEEE. Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.  
 Desk rejects  
 Desk rejects are made during the initial checks of submissions to save our reviewers‚Äô time. The main reasons for a desk rejections include:  
 Scope: clearly out of scope for conference (e.g. no relevance to robots or to human-robot interaction). 
  Anonymization: any violation of the rules detailed in the anonymization guidelines 
  Incomplete submissions: missing submission information (including an obviously placeholder title or abstract, etc.). 
  Formatting issues: | paper is breaking the full paper limit (eight pages excluding references); 
  using an incorrect submission format. 
  Other obvious issues, such as paper clearly unfinished, obvious use of foundation models for generating the contents, not written in English, etc. 
  Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks  
 Theory and Methods  
 The primary contribution for the Theory and Methods track is to further the conceptual foundations of HRI. This work helps us to expand upon the ways we think about human-robot interaction (theory) and upon the ways we engage in doing human-robot interaction research (methods). A key benefit of theory and methods work is not only in articulating what we know but there is also generating new ways of seeing the field and posing new questions.  
  Unlike in earlier years, this track will not include reproducibility. Reproducibility studies should be directed to the User Studies track. Theory papers focus on elucidating or connecting fundamental HRI principles beyond individual interfaces or projects, new theoretical concepts in HRI, literature reviews, etc. Such contributions may include meta-analyses of previous findings, narrative or philosophical arguments introducing theoretical or philosophical concepts, detailing underlying interaction paradigms, or providing new interpretations of previously known results.  
 Methods papers may include new ways of studying HRI, with focus on developing novel evaluation methodologies (e.g. new questionnaires), or in the analysis of existing research and methods derived from original or surveyed empirical research.  
 Successful papers in this track will clearly detail how they transform our current fundamental understanding of human-robot interaction and why the work is significant and has potential for impact. As appropriate, work must be defended by clear and sound arguments and a thorough reflective analysis of the contribution with respect to the existing state of the art.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the theory and methods track:  
 To the extent that methods papers might pertain to new metrics or methods of evaluation, they might include studies; however, the focus of the paper would be on evaluating the novelty and contribution of the concepts and methods, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  Theory papers are not expected to have user studies. 
  Methods for generating design belong in the Design track; methods for measuring or studying HRI belong in the Theory and Methods track. Technical methods or tools belong to the Technical track. 
  If the contribution is a clarification or improvement of an existing theory or method, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Chen et al., 2024  , Kim et al, 2024  , Winkle et al., 2023   
 Design  
 The Design track brings together design-centric research contributions to human-robot interaction (HRI). This includes novel design approaches, new robot morphologies, behavior paradigms, interaction techniques, and the exploration of new contexts for interaction that yield unique or improved interaction experiences with or capabilities for robots. The Design track explicitly welcomes papers focusing on design solutions with rigorous detail, as well as papers on design-driven methodologies (e.g., participatory design, critical design, and design for manufacturability) that influence how designers approach HRI design. Research on the design process itself, or proposing new design products, strategies, frameworks, or models relevant to HRI, belongs in the Design track. Submissions must fully describe their design outcomes or processes to enable detailed review and replication of the design process. Further, successful papers will include evaluations appropriate to the work, such as end-user evaluation or a critical reflection on the design process.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the Design track:  
 While there are often studies in the Design track papers, the focus of these studies lies in evaluating novel aspects and features of the design and resulting response or behavior, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions. 
  If the main contribution lies in some aspect of the software or hardware capabilities, and less in how the context or use matches the hardware or software, the paper might belong in the Systems track. 
  If the contribution is an implementation or improvement of an existing design, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Koike et al., 2024  , Walker et al., 2024  , Taylor et al., 2024  , Nanavati et al. 2023   
 Technical  
 The primary knowledge contribution of papers submitted to the technical track is expected to be a novel algorithm (formalized through pseudocode), mathematical model (formalized through a set of equations), tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, and should provide enough detail to allow reproducibility. The expectation is that methods will be at an appropriate level of rigor, approaches will be robust, confounding elements will be clearly noted, and evaluations are suitable to the type of contribution; evaluations do not  need to include user studies unless appropriate.  
 We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the technical track:  
 If a submitted paper contains a user study to empirically evaluate or demonstrate the primary knowledge contribution, authors should be clear in the paper why this paper is indeed a ‚Äútechnical‚Äù contribution rather than a ‚Äústudies‚Äù contribution. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the integration of disparate hardware or software capabilities, the paper likely belongs in the Systems track; however, if the novelty or main contribution lies in a novel individual component of a possibly integrated system, then the paper is appropriate for the Technical track. 
  If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the development of a code-based implementation of an existing technical contribution, rather than the algorithm or model itself, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Technical work may be evaluated in a variety of ways, non-exhaustively including proofs of correctness, proof-of-concept demonstration, evaluation in simulation (for example with an Wizard-of-Oz approach), performance evaluation of a novel sub-system or component, or user study. It is critical to ensure that the claims made by the paper are backed up by the evaluation. This means that while a well designed and appropriate  user study with a deployed robot may be advantageous, it is not necessary. Further, a poorly designed and inappropriate  user study presented in a technical paper may be worse than including no user study at all. However:  
 Authors of submitted papers whose evaluation does not support the paper‚Äôs claims (e.g., strong claims of an algorithm‚Äôs effect backed up only by a proof-of-concept demonstration or an underpowered user study) might be asked to revise their claims. 
  Authors whose paper does not contain a demonstration or study of a physical robot should provide a ‚Äúpathway to deployment‚Äù describing what would need to be done to reach successful deployment onto a physical platform. Such papers will still need either an analytical or computational/empirical evaluation. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Mahadevan et al., 2024  , Tung et al., 2024  , Trinh et al, 2024  , Brawer et al., 2023   
 Systems  
 Because HRI is by its nature an integrative discipline, the Systems track focuses on contributions which consist of a synthesis of underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior. Generally speaking, a Systems paper is one whose contribution is best observed and measured through performance of an integrated system, usually including a robot, rather than through component-level testing. This could involve some combination of novel system design or integration of novel techniques or components to enable new system-level functionality. The contribution of a Systems track paper could include demonstration of the usefulness of a component or technique in the larger system, achievement of new system-level capabilities, or enhanced system performance. Whether it belongs in these categories or others, authors should emphasize the novelty and significance of their contribution. In particular, authors should highlight what wider systems knowledge, best practices, lessons learned, etc. can be derived from their work and applied to future HRI problems. Papers‚Äô evaluations should be appropriate to the systems contribution being presented, potentially including demonstrations based on scenarios or case-studies, user studies, or technical performance evaluations. Similar to the Technical track, a well-designed  user study can help support a paper‚Äôs claims, but is not strictly necessary for acceptance.  
 Please note that:  
 If the | primary | contribution of a paper is an algorithm or a mathematical model, or is best measured via component-level testing rather than a systems-level evaluation, then the paper likely belongs to the Technical track; 
  If the paper‚Äôs contribution is about presenting a study to better understanding human behavior or preferences rather than system-level behavior based on integration, the paper may belong to the User Studies track; 
  If the contribution is limited to a description of a system design or dataset, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners / honorable mentions from previous years): Padmanabha et al., 2024  , Jenamani et al, 2024  , Bouzida et al., 2024  , Schoen et al., 2023   
 User Studies  
 The primary contribution of papers submitted to the studies track is expected to be new knowledge about human-robot interactions, based on a study conducted with people. These studies may take a variety of forms, including laboratory or field studies; other ethnographic and qualitative studies; exploratory, theory-building, or replicative studies; industry case studies, and so forth. These studies may use autonomous robots, Wizard of Oz, or may not involve a physical robot at all. In addition, like last year, reproducibility studies are included in this track. What is most important is the size of the knowledge contribution produced through this study for the human-robot interaction community. Because the primary knowledge contribution in this track is expected to be knowledge from a study with humans:  
 If a submitted paper contains evaluation of an implemented system, it should be clear why the insights from the study with humans are the primary knowledge contribution rather than the system itself, and thus, why the paper belongs in the Studies rather than Technical or Systems track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the creation of a new survey measure or other scientific tools, the paper likely belongs in the Theory and Methods track. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is a design process, or the description of a series of design steps used to design a robotic system, then the paper likely belongs in the Design track. For example, if an author performs a series of co-design workshops, the resulting paper would belong in the User Studies track if the contribution of the paper focused on the scientific insights gleaned from the analysis of those workshops, but would belong in the Design track if the contribution of the paper focused on the quality of the design process itself. 
  If the paper‚Äôs main contribution is the dataset rather than the experimental results themselves, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution. 
  Example papers (best paper winners from previous years): Pelikan et al., 2024  , Kamino et al., 2024  , Zhanatkyzy et al., 2023  , Ligthart et al., 2022

  Overview of Submission Types  
 There are many ways to contribute to the HRI conference, though the most common is to submit a paper of some new work or research you have done. The work is then evaluated by a group of experts (peer review process) and, if accepted, you‚Äôll have the opportunity to present it in a short talk, poster, video, demo, etc. at the conference.  This guide will give you a quick understanding of the different ways you can present your work at HRI.  
 Mature research work is often submitted as a Full Paper  to the HRI conference. In terms of quality and rigor, full papers are similar to a journal publication in other fields. The papers typically present the outcome of several months or years of hard work. They are anonymous submissions and are thoroughly peer reviewed in a two-stage process that includes an opportunity for authors to respond to the reviewers‚Äô comments before a final decision is made on the paper (rebuttal). You can submit your work under one of several specific tracks (see details on the Full Paper page  ) to ensure that you get the most qualified reviewers for your submission. Accepted Full Papers are published in the main conference proceedings.  
 Another way of contributing to the HRI conference is by submitting a Short Contribution  . The aim of Short Contribution papers is to promote the sharing, reuse, and replication of existing scientific work by submitting datasets or code related to human-robot interaction or by reporting on a replication study. The Short Contributions follow a rigorous review process and are published in the main conference proceedings.  
 If you‚Äôve been working on something you consider especially thought-provoking, controversial or methodologically unusual or risk-taking, you may want to think about writing an alt.HRI  contribution. The subject matter of alt.HRI papers often cuts across HRI themes and the discussion that alt.HRI papers generate can be considered as important as the paper itself. The alt.HRI papers are of similar rigor, quality and length as Full Papers.  
 In addition to the above paper types, the HRI conference has a Late Breaking Reports  track. This is a chance to write up your early research and present it as a Poster at the conference. This is usually a smaller contribution than a Full Paper and a great way to get feedback at the HRI conference.  
 Finally, there are a few other venues through which you can present HRI work at the conference:  
 If you‚Äôve done a great movie about your work, submit it to our | Video | category and get a chance to win a special prize! 
  If you want to submit a specialized installation of some kind or want to show your robot in action, then you should submit to | Demonstrations | . If you‚Äôre a startup looking for a place to show off your robotic system or related software: this could also be a great place to advertise your work or products. 
  Our | Student Design Competition | is an opportunity to submit a novel, wacky, crazy, alternative or bizarre work which doesn‚Äôt fit into any other place. 
  Workshops | are a great way to find your peer group! Let‚Äôs say you are interested in a specific topic, such as personal care robots for older adults or appearance design for robots ‚Äî and you want to meet others with the same interest. Find a few people with similar interests at other institutions or companies. Even for startups trying to find your lead users or people pushing the boundaries of your field, workshops can be a great way to find those people. Workshops can be half or full-day, and attract about 10-25 people. They‚Äôre collaborative events, about meeting new people and presenting early work in a field: if you want to teach people how to do something, then that‚Äôs a | Tutorial | . 
  If you are a student in HRI, the Pioneers Workshop  provides a great venue to present your work and meet with other students.

 The Thirty-Sixth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-24) February 22-24,2024  
 The Thirty-Sixth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-24) is a venue for papers describing highly innovative realizations of AI technology. The objective of the conference is to showcase successful applications and novel uses of AI. The conference will use technical papers, best practice papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI and the discourse on the actual deployment of AI in practice. The general goal of the conference is to teach people the challenges and solutions to accomplishing something useful in the real world, as opposed to describing a new algorithm.  
   
 IAAI-24 Schedule    
   
 Tracks with Accepted Papers  
  Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI‚Äã  
 Papers submitted to this track must describe deployed applications with measurable benefits that include an innovative use of AI technology. Applications are defined as deployed once they are in production use by their final end-users and the in-use experience can be meaningfully collected and reported. The study may evaluate either a stand-alone application or a component of a complex system.

 AAAI Classic Paper Award  
  
 The AAAI Classic Paper award honors the author(s) of paper(s) deemed most influential, chosen from a specific conference year. Each year, the time period considered will advance by one year. The 2025 award will be given to the most influential paper(s) from the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Artificial Intelligence.  
 Papers will be judged on the basis of impact, for example:  
 Started a new research (sub)area 
  Led to important applications 
  Answered a long-standing question/issue or clarified what had been murky 
  Made a major advance that figures in the history of the subarea 
  Has been picked up as important and used by other areas within (or outside of) AI 
  Has been very heavily cited 
  All members of the artificial intelligence community are encouraged to submit nominations for this award. Candidacy is not limited to AAAI members, nor to people still active in artificial intelligence. Posthumous awards will be considered.  
 Nominations will be reviewed by the AAAI Awards Committee. Nominations are due September 20, 2024.  
 The award will be presented at the AAAI-25 conference in Philadelphia, PA, USA. A total of $1,000 in travel support is available to enable the author(s) to travel to the conference to accept the award in person.

 Call for Papers  
 It is commonly acknowledged that security requirements cannot be addressed by technical means alone, and that a significant aspect of protection comes down to the attitudes awareness, behaviour and capabilities of the people involved. Indeed people can potentially represent a key asset in achieving security, but at present, factors such as lack of awareness and understanding combined with unreasonable demands from security technologies, can dramatically impede their ability to do so. Ensuring appropriate attention and support for the needs of users should therefore be seen as a vital element of a successful security strategy.  
 People at all levels (i.e. from organisations to domestic environments; from system administrators to end-users) need to understand security concepts, how the issues may apply to them, and how to use the available technology to protect their systems. In addition the technology itself can make a contribution by reducing the demands upon users, simplifying protection measures, and automating a variety of safeguards.  
 With the above in mind, this symposium specifically addresses information security issues that relate to people. It concerns the methods that inform and guide users' understanding of security, and the technologies that can benefit and support them in achieving protection.  
 Themes  
 The symposium welcomes papers addressing research and case studies in relation to any aspect of information security that pertains to the attitudes, perceptions and behaviour of people, and how human characteristics or technologies may be positively modified to improve the level of protection. Indicative themes include:  
 Information security culture 
  Awareness and education methods 
  Enhancing risk perception 
  Public understanding of security 
  Usable security 
  Psychological models of security software usage 
  User acceptance of security policies and technologies 
  User-friendly authentication methods 
  Biometric technologies and impacts 
  Automating security functionality 
  Non-intrusive security 
  Assisting security administration 
  Impacts of standards, policies, compliance requirements 
  Organizational governance for information assurance 
  Simplifying risk and threat assessment 
  Understanding motivations for misuse 
  Social engineering and other human-related risks 
  Privacy attitudes and practices 
  Computer ethics and security 
  Paper Submission, review and publication  
 Authors are invited to submit full papers, not exceeding 14 pages (including all figures, tables and references) by 4 April 2025.  
 Authors should consult Springer‚Äôs authors‚Äô guidelines and use their proceedings templates  , either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Copyright form  . The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
 Papers can be submitted to the conference paper management system here  . All papers will be double-blind reviewed by at least three members of the Programme Committee. All accepted papers will be published in the Proceedings. Selected papers will be considered for publication in the main sponsoring journal, Information & Computer Security  .
