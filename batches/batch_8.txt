 About CAADRIA2025           
   
 The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) was established to promote the dissemination of information on computer-aided design among research and educational institutions in the fields of architecture, urban engineering, and information technology in Asia. Since then, 28 annual conferences have been held in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries.   
 The conferences provide an opportunity for teachers, students, researchers, and practitioners to meet each other and learn about the latest research in the field. In recent years, research has expanded beyond the initial CAD framework into the field of architectural informatics, capturing trends in diverse information fields related to architecture. Furthermore, the number of accepted papers has increased rapidly in this active conference.   
 Japan is one of the founding countries of CAADRIA. While previous conferences have been held at Osaka University, Kumamoto University, and Kyoto Institute of Technology, it will be the first time in Tokyo. Therefore, with CAADRIA 2025, we aim to make Japanese researchers aware of international trends and provide an opportunity for overseas researchers to engage with the uniqueness and advanced nature of Japanese research.   
 CAADRIA has traditionally set the registration fee for students at about half price. Furthermore, the conference also has an awarding system for excellent papers, such as the Young CAADRIA Award, and the registration fee is waived for young researchers who receive the award. In addition to research presentations, there will be a Post Graduate Consortium, a session for doctoral students to exchange opinions on their research policies, and educational workshops where students can learn through direct use of digital fabrication equipment, IoT equipment, XR equipment, etc. These are valuable opportunities for students from the host country to participate and be motivated to explore new fields. In addition, exchanges with leading foreign researchers strengthen international relationships and foster research collaborations.   
 We believe that the purpose of holding this event is to contribute to the development of the architectural information field through the wide-ranging exchanges among students and researchers.

 CAADRIA 2025 invites contributions in line with the 2025 Conference Theme of "Architectural Informatics"  
  
 The concepts of architecture and cities are historically intrinsic to human civilization, as a consciousness of mankind's need to construct artificial environments. However, decades after the advent of computers, we are now reconsidering their existence against the backdrop of the rapid expansion and evolution of information technology and its profound impact on industry, the economy, daily life, and society.  
  
 The quantum acceleration of information processing and communication has had a profound impact on the design of all kinds of artifacts, production techniques, management systems, and usage patterns, and has already surpassed the traditional concept of design and its support methods. By considering social activities and human organizations as forms of information processing, we can reconsider architecture and cities as information systems that have been constructed, accumulated, and acted upon. Viewing architecture and cities through this lens suggests that real and virtual spaces should not be seen as opposing entities, but rather as complementary components within a unified system.  
  
 In other words, information may be architecture. With “Architectural Informatics” as the theme of CAADRIA's 30th anniversary, we would like to reexamine the fundamental existence of architecture in the age of information technology.  
  
 ​We invite original high-quality papers presenting current computer-aided architectural design research, accommodating a broad spectrum of approaches ranging from speculative, informal investigations to conventional scientific research, including but not limited to the following topics:  
 ​   
 Artificial intelligence, neural networks and machine learning 
  Building Information Modeling (BIM) 
  City Information Modeling (CIM) 
  Collective, collaborative & interdisciplinary design 
  Computational design research & education 
  Design cognition and human-computer interaction 
  Disrupted practices, resilience, and social sustainability 
  Environmental and ecological performance 
  Generative, algorithmic & evolutionary design 
  Digital Heritage 
  Interactive environments 
  Material systems, processes and assembly 
  Practice-based design research 
  Robotics, digital fabrication and construction 
  Simulation, visualisation and impact projection 
  Theory, philosophy & methodology of computational design research 
  Urban analytics, big data analysis and smart cities 
  AR / VR / XR 
  Application of technology in the context of the Asia-Pacific Region 
   
 Paper acceptance will be subject to a two-stage reviewing process, based on an initial abstract review and a later double-blind peer review of full-length manuscripts. The paper publication will be subject to review acceptance, compliance with submission deadlines and formatting guidelines, and to payment of the conference registration fee. Please kindly note that multiple submissions are subject to multiple registrations.

 CAiSE'25 | 37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering | Theme: Bridging Silos | Vienna, Austria  June 16-20, 2025 | Open Calls 

 Theme: Bridging Silos   
 Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are applied in diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. The discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation.  
  Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is "Bridging Silos." We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.

 CAiSE'25 Call for Papers  
 The CAiSE’25 organization calls for full papers with a special emphasis on the theme of Bridging Silos  .  
 Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design, encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are utilized in increasingly diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. At the same time, the discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos within the field of information systems engineering. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation. Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is Bridging Silos  .  
 We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering (ISE) as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects across the life cycle of information systems across their design, development, deployment and operation. Submissions concerned with specific specializations are certainly welcome, but they must explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.  
 In addition to offering an exciting scientific program, CAiSE’25 will feature a best paper award, and a journal special issue:  
 Best Paper Award: | prize EUR 1000 (sponsored by Springer) 
  A small selection of best papers will be invited to submit enhanced versions for consideration in a special issue of Elsevier Information Systems journal dedicated to this conference. 
   
 Papers should be submitted as PDF, following Springer’s LNCS format, and should not exceed 14 pages, excluding the references  , but including all text, figures, and appendices. Submissions not conforming to the LNCS format, the page limitations, or being obviously out of the scope of the conference, will be rejected without review. For Springer’s LNCS format, see the guidelines provided at:  
 Springer’s LNCS Format Guidelines   
 The results described in the submitted paper must be unpublished and must not be under review elsewhere. Three to five keywords characterizing the paper should be listed at the end of the abstract. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two program committee members and, if positively evaluated, a third review will be conducted by one additional program board member. The selected papers will be discussed among the paper reviewers online, as well as during the program board meeting. As the review process is not blind, please indicate your name and affiliation on your submission. Accepted papers will be presented at CAiSE’25 and published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) conference proceedings.  

 Types of Scientific Papers  
 We invite three types of scientific papers: technical papers, empirical papers, and exploratory papers. The type of submission must be indicated in the submission system. Each contribution should explicitly identify the information systems engineering problem addressed, its expected real-world impact, and the research method used. Furthermore, as mentioned above, submissions concerned with specific specializations within the information systems engineering field are certainly welcome. However, they must explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation. We strongly advise authors to clearly emphasize these aspects in their paper, including the abstract.  
 Technical Papers  
 Technical papers describe original insights pertaining to the field of information systems engineering. A technical paper should clearly describe the situation or type of problem tackled, the relevant state of the art, the position or solution suggested and its potential, as well as demonstrate the benefits of the contribution through a rigorous evaluation. We explicitly welcome three kinds of technical papers:  
 Technology oriented papers: | produce and evaluate some technological artifact (infrastructure, tool, language, or system) in controlled/scoped experiments in lab settings. 
  Method oriented papers: | evaluate, produce and evaluate some socio-technological artifact (a method, approach to be used in an information systems engineering context) that needs to be evaluated in a (less controllable) real world setting. 
  Conceptual and theoretical papers: | deal with ontological, philosophical, semiotic, and mathematical foundations of information systems engineering. These papers typically use a deduction and/or argumentation based approach to develop a point/contribution as part of their evaluation. 
   
  Empirical Papers  
 Empirical papers evaluate existing problem situations including problems encountered in practice, or validate proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, experiments, case studies, experience reports, simulations, etc. Scientific reflection on problems and practices in industry also falls into this category. The topic of the evaluation presented in the paper as well as its causal or logical properties must be clearly stated. The research method must be sound and appropriate.  
 Exploratory Papers  
 Exploratory papers describe completely new research positions or approaches, in order to face a generic situation arising because of new ICT, new kinds of activities, or new IS challenges. They must precisely describe the situation and demonstrate why current methods, tools, ways of reasoning, or meta-models are inadequate. They must also rigorously present their approach and demonstrate its pertinence and correctness in addressing the identified situation.

 Scope  
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Bloomington, Indiana (US, 2023), Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK, 2019), Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005). The 11th edition will be held in Glasgow, UK, co-located with MFPS XLI. It is planned as a physical, in-person event.  
 Submission Categories  
 CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of submissions.  
 Regular papers that report  
 results on theoretical foundations, 
  novel methods and techniques for software development, 
  experiences with technology transfer to industry. 
  (Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that  
 present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way. 
  Early ideas abstracts that lead to  
 presentations of work in progress, 
  proposals for original venues of research. 
  Tool presentation papers that  
 report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools. 
  Topics of Interest  
 All topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications are of interest for CALCO, and among them  
 Models and logics | Automata and languages 
  Graph transformations and term rewriting 
  Modal logics 
  Proof systems

  Submission Guidelines  
 All submissions will be handled via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25   
 The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the latest version of the style: http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/   
 It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics series.  
 A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer Science  , containing extended versions of selected papers, is planned.  
 Regular papers  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (Co)algebraic pearls  
 This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should not be longer than regular papers in the format specified by LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference.  
 Early ideas abstracts  
 Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.  
 Tool papers  
 Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the time of submission for download and evaluation.  
 Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards  
 This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants.

 Scope  
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Bloomington, Indiana (US, 2023), Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK, 2019), Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005). The 11th edition will be held in Glasgow, UK, co-located with MFPS XLI. It is planned as a physical, in-person event.  
 Submission Categories  
 CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of submissions.  
 Regular papers that report  
 results on theoretical foundations, 
  novel methods and techniques for software development, 
  experiences with technology transfer to industry. 
  (Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that  
 present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way. 
  Early ideas abstracts that lead to  
 presentations of work in progress, 
  proposals for original venues of research. 
  Tool presentation papers that  
 report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools. 
  Topics of Interest

  Submission Guidelines  
 All submissions will be handled via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25   
 The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the latest version of the style: http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/   
 It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics series.  
 A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer Science  , containing extended versions of selected papers, is planned.  
 Regular papers  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (Co)algebraic pearls  
 This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should not be longer than regular papers in the format specified by LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference.  
 Early ideas abstracts  
 Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere.  
 Tool papers  
 Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the time of submission for download and evaluation.  
 Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards  
 This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants.

 Our Research Association  

 Home   | About ForDaySec   | Our Research Association     
 Topic of the Research Association  
 The unique selling point of the Bavarian research association “Security in Everyday Digitization” (ForDaySec) is the targeted, interdisciplinary research into novel technical processes for the cyber security of private households, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and public administration. With this goal in mind, ForDaySec is researching, in addition to solutions for increasing security for hardware and software, special security concepts that should be easy to implement without special knowledge and at the same time take into account the aspects of technical data protection. The research also includes legal studies on update obligations and sociological studies on the use of technology in everyday practice.  
 Social Relevance  
 The digitization of everyday life is one of the key challenges facing our society. Networked systems permeate all areas of our society – this applies to private households (for example, the vacuum cleaner robot or the digital heating control system) as well as to production operations of medium-sized companies, craft enterprises, housing associations or to municipally operated critical infrastructures (such as healthcare or water supply). Something can be observed everywhere: Components without security functions are being used unthinkingly, previously independent systems are being networked without precautions, and both the knowledge and the human resources to actively manage cybersecurity are missing in many places.  
 Moreover, existing digital infrastructures often cannot be fundamentally redesigned or changed to secure them – security solutions must be designed using existing systems and components, and integrated into the existing stock. In the sense of “security by default”, there is also a need to make security and data protection technologies simple and easy to administer and implement without in-depth specialist knowledge. Here, however, the challenges are not only of a technical nature, but also encounter organizational, procedural and personnel hurdles. Interdisciplinary research that systematically integrates the challenges of everyday practice and everyday practices from the outset is therefore imperative. Our group takes this mixed situation into account and uses it as a starting point for its research.  
 Structure  
 In the research association ForDaySec, scientists from five Bavarian universities are working in eight projects to make everyday digital life more secure. The associatopn works interdisciplinarily and combines the perspectives of three disciplines: Computer Science, Sociology of Technology, and Law.  
 Each of the projects conducts research on its own topic in its own discipline. In addition, the members work in close cooperation on cross-cutting issues   .  
 The research association is represented publicly by co-speakers  elected by the members (Prof. Dr. Stefan Katzenbeisser and Prof. Dr. Felix Freiling). The management office  is located at the University of Passau at the professorship of Prof. Dr. Katzenbeisser. The office  is the central point of contact for members, external partners and those interested in our association.  
 ForDaySec is one of several Bavarian research alliances under the umbrella of the Bavarian Research Alliance  .  
 Interdisciplinarity  
 The eight projects at five universities involved in ForDaySec rely on a systematic interdisciplinary approach. The scientists  from the fields of computer science, business informatics, sociology and law are developing a comprehensive understanding of how technologies can be optimized and sustainably implemented to safeguard everyday digital life.  
 While specific individual questions are dealt with in the eight projects, interdisciplinary cooperation takes place in particular within the working groups on the cross-cutting issues  .

 CARDIS 2023, November 15-16, 2023, in-person event  
 22nd Smart Card Research and Advanced Application Conference   
 Scope  
 CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart cards play an increasingly important role in our day-to-day live through their use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic passports, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It is thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security features and to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable performances. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from industry, academia, and standardization bodies to make steps forward in the field of embedded security.  
 The 22nd edition of CARDIS is organized by the Complex Cyber Infrastructure  group of the University of Amsterdam  in Amsterdam, NL. CARDIS 2023 will be an in-person event, with the possibility to attend talks remotely (presenters are required to participate to the conference in presence).

 About the conference    

 The International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) is a premier forum for presenting research in the field of cryptology and network security. The conference seeks academic, industry, and government submissions on all theoretical and practical aspects of cryptology and network security. This year marks the 23rd iteration of the conference and will be held at the University of Cambridge, England.  Proceedings of this year's conference will be published by Springer LNCS  ; p  roceedings of  previous iterations of the conference   can be found online.   

 Submission guidelines    

 High quality papers on unpublished research and implementation experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not substantially duplicated work that has been published at, or is simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop. All submissions must be written in English and span no more than 20 pages in the Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format (a Springer template can be found in Overleaf), including title, abstract, and bibliography. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related work.   
 Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of well-marked appendices. Note that supplementary material will not be included in the proceedings. Moreover, the main paper should be intelligible without requiring the reader to consult the supplementary material.   
 Submissions must be  anonymous  (no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references). The conference will also consider short papers of up to eight pages in the LNCS format, excluding the bibliography (max 2 pages), for results that are not yet fully fleshed out or that simply require few pages to describe but still make a significant contribution.   
 All submissions must be processed with LaTeX2e according to the instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in plain Springer LNCS format, in particular without changing the font size, margins or line spacing. Submissions not meeting these guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merits.   
 Papers must be submitted via  EasyChair   . The deadline for submissions is  14 April  24 April anywhere on earth (AoE).

 About the conference    

 The International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) is a premier forum for presenting research in the field of cryptology and network security. The conference seeks academic, industry, and government submissions on all theoretical and practical aspects of cryptology and network security. This year marks the 23rd iteration of the conference and will be held at the University of Cambridge, England.  Proceedings of this year's conference will be published by Springer LNCS  ; p  roceedings of  previous iterations of the conference   can be found online.   

 Submission guidelines    

 High quality papers on unpublished research and implementation experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not substantially duplicated work that has been published at, or is simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop. All submissions must be written in English and span no more than 20 pages in the Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format (a Springer template can be found in Overleaf), including title, abstract, and bibliography. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related work.   
 Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of well-marked appendices. Note that supplementary material will not be included in the proceedings. Moreover, the main paper should be intelligible without requiring the reader to consult the supplementary material.   
 Submissions must be  anonymous  (no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references). The conference will also consider short papers of up to eight pages in the LNCS format, excluding the bibliography (max 2 pages), for results that are not yet fully fleshed out or that simply require few pages to describe but still make a significant contribution.   
 All submissions must be processed with LaTeX2e according to the instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in plain Springer LNCS format, in particular without changing the font size, margins or line spacing. Submissions not meeting these guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merits.   
 Papers must be submitted via  EasyChair   . The deadline for submissions is  14 April  24 April anywhere on earth (AoE).

 Scope  
 CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart cards play an increasingly important role in our day-to-day live through their use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic passports, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It is thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security features and to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable performances. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from industry, academia, and standardization bodies to make steps forward in the field of embedded security.  
 The 19th edition of CARDIS is organized by Institute for IT Security  of the Universität zu Lübeck in Lübeck  , Germany.

33. Conference CASC_2:
Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing    
 Menu    

 ​​​​ CASC 2024 · Sept. 2 - 6, Rennes, France  
 Proceedings  
 The accepted CASC 2024 papers are published in the Springer-Verlag series Lecture Notes in Computer Science.  
   
  Get online access to the proceedings here  .   
 Conference Information  
 The tools of Scientific Computing play an important role in the natural sciences and engineering. Computer Algebra Systems and the underlying algorithms for Symbolic Computation play an increasingly important role within Scientific Computation. The CASC workshop series has been running for over two decades to explore the interaction of these topics, their implementation, and their application.  
 Scope  
 The topics addressed in the workshop cover  
 1. The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems.  
  This includes, but is not limited to:  
 new methods on exact computation; 
  symbolic algorithms and their complexity; 
  automated reasoning in algebra and geometry; 
  parallel symbolic / symbolic-numeric computation; 
  symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for differential, differential-algebraic and difference equations; 
  symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for polynomial equations and inequalities; 
  the embedding of computer algebra technology within different software and hardware environments; 
  2. All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software.  
  This includes, but is not limited to:  
 the use of computer algebra in approximate computation; 
  computer algebra methods in big data analytics; 
  computer algebra methods for simulation and modeling; 
  3. Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering.  
 We welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title.  
 Conference Participation Options  
 We encourage wide participation at the workshop. In light of this, and that the conference scope spans computer science and mathematics (with their different publication traditions), we offer a variety of participation options.  
 1. Participation with an accompanying paper in LNCS:   
   
  CASC has a long running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science to publish conference proceedings. Work submitted here should contain an original research result. Submissions should be prepared in the LNCS style  and not exceed 20 pages. Survey papers may have up to 25 pages. Click on the below logo to see the list of CASC proceedings published by Springer.  
   2. Participation with abstract only:  
   
  Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least 2 and at most 4 pages in the LNCS style.  They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs). They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference. We see three main audiences for this option:  
 Those who wish to talk on previously published work (in which case that work should be clearly cited in the abstract). 
  Those whose work is not yet ready for publication, but wish to receive feedback. 
  Those who plan to submit a journal paper on the work shortly. 
  For the second group, there will be a subsequent journal topical collection call after the conference (see below).  
 Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer Science  
 CASC has formed a relationship with the Springer Birkhäuser journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS) for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that years conference. There is no a priori page limit, but the length must be justified by the contents of the paper. At notification authors may be asked to revise their paper for a secondary deadline.  
 Important Dates:  
 Paper submission deadline: | 26th April 2024. Extended until 5th May 2024. 
  Notification of acceptance: | 5th June 2024. 
  Submission of final version: | 14th June 2024.

 Computer Security & Cryptography   Security & Trust & Testing    

  CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on  
  security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart cards play an increasingly  
  important role in our day-to-day life through their use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic  
  passports, and IoT devices. It is thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security  
  features and to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable  
  performance. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from industry, academia, and  
  standardization bodies to make steps forward in the field of embedded security.  
  The 21st edition of CARDIS is organized by the Centre for Cyber Security and Privacy of the  
  University of Birmingham, UK. CARDIS 2022 will be accompanied by a one-day Fall School event,  
  with more details to be announced.

 CASES: CALL FOR PAPERS  
 CASES is a premier forum, where researchers, developers, and practitioners exchange information on the latest advances in design, optimization, validation, and applications of embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT), and the emergent trend of integrating Artificial Intelligence into IoT (AIoT). The conference has a long tradition of showcasing cutting-edge research in these broad areas, covering topics including, but not limited to, hardware-software co-design and co-validation, edge AI, embedded architecture, memory/storage technology, security/reliability, energy-efficiency of embedded systems, and domain-specific hardware accelerators. We solicit submission of original research articles on these topics divided into five technical tracks. Each submission needs to specify one primary and one secondary track relevant to the paper’s technical content.

 About  

 CAV is the premier international conference on computer-aided verification. It provides a forum for a broad range of advanced research in areas ranging model checking and automated theorem proving to testing, synthesis and related fields. Research reported in CAV includes the application of formal methods to many kinds of systems,including hardware, software and communication protocols. It covers many system models, including finite-state and infinite state systems, hybrid systems and probabilistic systems. It encompasses both theory and industrial case studies. The common thread is the use of automation to help designers build more reliable systems.  
 CAV is held each year in July, and usually alternates between North America and Europe. It began as a workshop held in 1989 in Grenoble France. Subsequently, CAV was organized as a conference by Edmund Clarke, Robert Kurshan, Amir Pnueli and Joseph Sifakis. It has been held each year since 1990. A list of past and planned CAV conferences by year can be found below.  
 The current steering committee of CAV consists of:  
 Orna Grumberg  , The Technion  
  Aarti Gupta  , Princeton University  
  Daniel Kröning  , University of Oxford  
  Ken McMillan  , UT Austin

 SCOPE   
 CAV 2024 is the 36th in a series dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for hardware and software systems. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. CAV considers it vital to continue spurring advances in hardware and software verification while expanding to new domains such as machine learning, autonomous systems, and computer security. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A selection of papers is expected to be invited to a special issue of Formal Methods in System Design and the Journal of the ACM.  
 Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations 
  Algorithms and tools for system synthesis 
  Algorithms and tools that combine verification and learning 
  Mathematical and logical foundations of verification and synthesis 
  Specifications and correctness criteria for programs and systems 
  Deductive verification using proof assistants 
  Hardware verification techniques 
  Program analysis and software verification 
  Software synthesis 
  Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification 
  Formal methods for cyber-physical systems 
  Compositional and abstraction-based techniques for verification 
  Probabilistic and statistical approaches to verification 
  Verification methods for parallel and concurrent systems 
  Testing and run-time analysis based on verification technology 
  Decision procedures and solvers for verification and synthesis 
  Applications and case studies in verification and synthesis 
  Verification in industrial practice 
  New application areas for algorithmic verification and synthesis 
  Formal models and methods for security 
  Formal models and methods for biological systems 
  Submissions on a wide range of topics are sought, particularly ones that identify new research directions. CAV 2024 is not limited to topics discussed in previous instances of the conference. Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic may communicate with the conference chairs prior to submission.  
 CAV AWARD   
 The CAV award is given annually at the CAV conference for fundamental contributions to the field of Computer-Aided Verification.  
 CAV Award Nomination deadline: March 1st, 2024   
 Nominations should include a proposed citation (up to 25 words), a succinct (100-250 words) description of the contribution(s), and a detailed statement to justify the nomination. The cited contribution(s) must have been made not more recently than five years ago and not over twenty five years ago. In addition, the contribution(s) should not yet have received recognition via a major award, such as the ACM Turing or Kanellakis Awards. The nominee may have received such an award for other contributions.  
 For previous winners of the award, please see the main CAV award page  .  
 Nominations should be submitted by e-mail to a member of the committee. For details, please see https://i-cav.org/2024/cav-award/  .  
 PAPER SUBMISSION   
 Paper submissions in CAV fall into one of the following three categories (see more information below):  
 Regular Papers (18 pages max, must be anonymized) 
  Tool Papers (10 pages max, not anonymized) 
  Industrial Experience Reports & Case Studies. (10 pages max, not anonymized) 
  Papers in all three categories must be submitted by January 19th, 2024 AoE, and should be in LNCS format. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed. The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit further reviews after the rebuttal period.  
 REGULAR PAPERS   
 Regular papers should not exceed 18 pages in LNCS format, not counting references and appendices.  
 Regular papers at CAV 2024 will follow a full double blind review process, which means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person. These are firm submission requirements, and any regular paper that does not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.  
 We do not discourage authors to put their submission on arXiv, but we strongly encourage authors to not put the work on arXiv around (within 1 week) or shortly after (within 1 month) the submission deadline, because potential reviewers may be subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers.  
 Authors can include a clearly marked appendix at the end of their submissions that is exempt from the page limit restrictions. However, the reviewers are not obliged to read the contents of these appendices. Regular papers should contain original research and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. Papers will be evaluated on the basis of a combination of correctness, technical depth, significance, novelty, clarity, and elegance.  
 Authors of accepted regular papers will be invited (but are not required) to submit a relevant artifact for evaluation by the artifact evaluation committee. Authors are encouraged to consult SIGPLAN’s Empirical Evaluation Guidelines  when reporting on empirical results.  
 TOOL PAPERS   
 Tool papers should not exceed 10 pages, not counting references.  
 Tool papers should describe system and implementation aspects of a tool with a large (potential) user base (experiments not required, rehash of theory strongly discouraged). Papers describing tools that have already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.  
 Tool papers will follow a single blind review process. They do NOT need to be anonymized.  
 Tool papers will be provisionally accepted based on the manuscript. Authors of provisionally accepted tool papers must submit an artifact for evaluation by the artifact evaluation committee: final acceptance is conditional on successful artifact evaluation at the “functional” level. In special cases, where an artifact cannot be submitted, the authors should contact the Artifact Evaluation chairs to find alternate modes of artifact evaluation.  
 INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE REPORTS AND CASE STUDIES   
 Industrial Experience Reports and Case Studies should not exceed 10 pages, not counting references.  
 These papers are expected to describe the use of formal methods techniques in industrial settings or in new application domains. Papers in this category do not necessarily need to present original research results but are expected to contain novel applications of formal methods techniques as well as an evaluation of these techniques in the chosen application domain. Such papers are encouraged to discuss the unique challenges of transferring research ideas to a real-world setting and reflect on any lessons learned from this technology transfer experience.  
 Industrial Experience Reports and Case Studies will follow a single blind review process. They do NOT need to be anonymized.  
 Authors of accepted Industrial Experience Reports and Case Studies will be invited (but are not required) to submit a relevant artifact for evaluation by the artifact evaluation committee.

 Springer is able to manage ORCID related to the authors and the Proceedings Volumes Editors! Please add the ORCID related to each author of your submitted paper to avoid mismatches in bibliometric mapping!!!     
 Warning: Fake ICCSA Conference by WASET   
  We have noticed the existence of organisations such as WASET that run fake “conferences” in order to make profit with the registration fees, often spoofing the names of real conferences. WASET claims to be organising a conference called ICCSA next year, which is a FAKE ICCSA conference.  
  The Real ICCSA conference has been organised by the ICCSA Society since 2003. We do not have any involvement with WASET. Please spread this news to your contacts and communities so that nobody mistakenly participates to such fake conferences.  
  WASET is predator publisher. Go to this Wiki Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology
