 Call for Papers  
 The 32nd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols   (ICNP 2024)  
  Charleroi, Belgium, October 28-31, 2024 Follow @IEEE_ICNP     
   
 ICNP, the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, is the premier conference covering all aspects of network protocol research, including design, analysis, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. ICNP 2024 will be organized by UCLouvain and the University of Mons in Charleroi, Belgium on October 28-31, 2024.  
 Scope  
 The conference is soliciting paper submissions with significant research contributions to the field of network protocol  research. Both experimental studies as well as formal investigations are equally welcome. Topics traditionally of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 All aspects of network protocol research including design, specification, verification implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis. 
  Protocols for data center networks, software-defined networks, information-centric networking (ICN), AI/ML clusters, Internet of Things, cellular networks, sensor networks, satellite networks, vehicular networks, and wireless networks. 
  Domain-specific solutions, including protocols for network security, routing, user privacy, or network management. 
  Network protocols meet AI/ML, e.g., application of AI/ML to improve network protocols and operations; networking and protocols for improving the performance of AI/ML systems. 
  Contributions to network architecture, e.g., algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures. 
  Contributions to other areas of data communications to the extent that they articulate a strong connection to network protocols, for example by discussing potential implications on the design, implementation or performance of certain types of network protocols. 
  Authors who are unsure whether or not their submissions might fit the scope of the conference are welcome to contact the Program Committee Co-Chairs.

 Paper Formatting  
 Paper submissions should adhere to the IEEE Conference formatting requirements using the templates available here  , and should not exceed 10 pages excluding  references. It is the authors' responsibility to produce readable submissions that comply with the formatting constraints. Violating the formatting requirements to squeeze in additional materials will result in a submission being returned without being reviewed. The authors would have developed software or collected data for the paper are encouraged to release their artefacts and describe them in the submitted paper. To preserve anonymity, the artefacts will only be publicly released upon paper acceptance.  
 Submission and Anonymity Policy  
 Papers submitted to the conference will be reviewed through a double-blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers (and that of the reviewers from the authors). Achieving this goal requires some care to, on the one hand, preserve the anonymity of your submission, and on the other hand ensuring proper coverage of related past work, including your own. While this requirement may seem challenging, the few basic steps listed below will go a long way towards achieving the desired outcome:  
 Remove all authors' identifiers, e.g., names, emails, and affiliations, from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgments of and identifiers of funding sources. 
  Use anonymous names for your files, as source file names are often embedded in the final output you generate, and therefore accessible as comments. 
  When referring to your own related work, refer to it in the third person as you would with any other related work by another author. 
  Besides anonymizing your submission, double-blind reviewing also imposes additional requirements on both authors and reviewers. Specifically, while it is permissible for authors to give local talks on their work and release their paper on a non-peer-reviewed location, e.g., an institutional repository or even arXiv, care should be exercised to limit public exposure as much as possible. This requirement includes refraining from advertising the work on mailing lists and public forums, and in general limiting as much as possible the odds that program committee members be exposed to the work and the authors’ identity. Conversely, program committee members will be advised to neither actively seek to “reverse engineer” the authors’ identity, nor to directly share with other program committee members any such information they may have acquired. All questions regarding possible breaches of the anonymity covenant that underlies the double-blind review process will be adjudicated by the Program Committee Co-Chairs. All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 Submission and Plagiarism Policy  
 Papers must present original contributions and can neither be previously published nor under review by another conference or journal. Papers containing plagiarized materials will be subject to the IEEE plagiarism policy  and possible penalties and will be rejected without being reviewed.  
 Best Paper Award and Fast-Track Journal Publication  
 One of the accepted papers will be selected for the Best Paper award and will be fast tracked to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, with a streamlined journal review process.  
 Presentation and Registration Requirements  
 ICNP 2024 will be held physically in-person in Charleroi, Belgium. IEEE ICNP requires that at least one of the authors of any accepted paper must register for the conference at the full rate and be available to present the paper at the conference. Any paper that is not presented by an author of the paper will be withdrawn from the proceedings and thus from IEEE Xplore.

 Call for Papers  
 The 32nd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols   (ICNP 2024)  
  Charleroi, Belgium, October 28-31, 2024 Follow @IEEE_ICNP     
   
 ICNP, the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, is the premier conference covering all aspects of network protocol research, including design, analysis, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. ICNP 2024 will be organized by UCLouvain and the University of Mons in Charleroi, Belgium on October 28-31, 2024.  
 Scope  
 The conference is soliciting paper submissions with significant research contributions to the field of network protocol  research. Both experimental studies as well as formal investigations are equally welcome. Topics traditionally of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 All aspects of network protocol research including design, specification, verification implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis. 
  Protocols for data center networks, software-defined networks, information-centric networking (ICN), AI/ML clusters, Internet of Things, cellular networks, sensor networks, satellite networks, vehicular networks, and wireless networks. 
  Domain-specific solutions, including protocols for network security, routing, user privacy, or network management. 
  Network protocols meet AI/ML, e.g., application of AI/ML to improve network protocols and operations; networking and protocols for improving the performance of AI/ML systems. 
  Contributions to network architecture, e.g., algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures. 
  Contributions to other areas of data communications to the extent that they articulate a strong connection to network protocols, for example by discussing potential implications on the design, implementation or performance of certain types of network protocols. 
  Authors who are unsure whether or not their submissions might fit the scope of the conference are welcome to contact the Program Committee Co-Chairs.  
 Technical Program Chairs

 Title / Abstract registration: | May 17, 2024 (AoE) 
 Full paper submission: | May 24, 2024 (AoE) 
 Notification of acceptance: | July 28, 2024 
 Camera ready version: | September 16, 2024 
  
 Paper Formatting  
 Paper submissions should adhere to the IEEE Conference formatting requirements using the templates available here  , and should not exceed 10 pages excluding  references. It is the authors' responsibility to produce readable submissions that comply with the formatting constraints. Violating the formatting requirements to squeeze in additional materials will result in a submission being returned without being reviewed. The authors would have developed software or collected data for the paper are encouraged to release their artefacts and describe them in the submitted paper. To preserve anonymity, the artefacts will only be publicly released upon paper acceptance.  
 Submission and Anonymity Policy  
 Papers submitted to the conference will be reviewed through a double-blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers (and that of the reviewers from the authors). Achieving this goal requires some care to, on the one hand, preserve the anonymity of your submission, and on the other hand ensuring proper coverage of related past work, including your own. While this requirement may seem challenging, the few basic steps listed below will go a long way towards achieving the desired outcome:  
 Remove all authors' identifiers, e.g., names, emails, and affiliations, from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgments of and identifiers of funding sources. 
  Use anonymous names for your files, as source file names are often embedded in the final output you generate, and therefore accessible as comments. 
  When referring to your own related work, refer to it in the third person as you would with any other related work by another author. 
  Besides anonymizing your submission, double-blind reviewing also imposes additional requirements on both authors and reviewers. Specifically, while it is permissible for authors to give local talks on their work and release their paper on a non-peer-reviewed location, e.g., an institutional repository or even arXiv, care should be exercised to limit public exposure as much as possible. This requirement includes refraining from advertising the work on mailing lists and public forums, and in general limiting as much as possible the odds that program committee members be exposed to the work and the authors’ identity. Conversely, program committee members will be advised to neither actively seek to “reverse engineer” the authors’ identity, nor to directly share with other program committee members any such information they may have acquired. All questions regarding possible breaches of the anonymity covenant that underlies the double-blind review process will be adjudicated by the Program Committee Co-Chairs. All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.  
 Submission and Plagiarism Policy  
 Papers must present original contributions and can neither be previously published nor under review by another conference or journal. Papers containing plagiarized materials will be subject to the IEEE plagiarism policy  and possible penalties and will be rejected without being reviewed.  
 Best Paper Award and Fast-Track Journal Publication  
 One of the accepted papers will be selected for the Best Paper award and will be fast tracked to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, with a streamlined journal review process.  
 Presentation and Registration Requirements  
 ICNP 2024 will be held physically in-person in Charleroi, Belgium. IEEE ICNP requires that at least one of the authors of any accepted paper must register for the conference at the full rate and be available to present the paper at the conference. Any paper that is not presented by an author of the paper will be withdrawn from the proceedings and thus from IEEE Xplore.

  2 nd  International Conference on Emerging Frontiers in Nonlinear Complex Systems, Computational Intelligence and their Applications  
 April 23-25, 2025  
 Organized by  
 Department of Mathematics  
  School of Advanced Sciences  
  Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai India  

 ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE:   
 Nonlinear Complex Systems:  The branch of mathematics and physics deals with systems governed by nonlinear equations or laws. Nonlinear dynamical systems exhibit complex behavior and are often characterized by sensitivity to initial conditions and the emergence of chaotic patterns. The field finds applications in various disciplines, including engineering, biology, economics, and more.  
  The conference highlights the study of systems displaying nonlinear behavior, leading to intricate dynamics. Nonlinear systems are characterized by interactions and relationships among components that do not adhere to simple linear patterns, making their behavior challenging to predict and comprehend.  
 Computational Intelligence:  An area of artificial intelligence (AI) aiming to develop algorithms and models inspired by human intelligence and cognitive processes. It encompasses various techniques such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, and swarm intelligence. Computational intelligence is employed to solve complex problems and make intelligent decisions across diverse domains. The conference likely emphasizes the application of computational techniques and intelligent algorithms to address complex issues within the context of nonlinear systems. Computational intelligence utilizes AI, machine learning, and other advanced computational methods to analyze, model, and predict behavior within complex systems, which may be challenging to analyze using traditional approaches.  
 The combination of these two fields in an international conference suggests an interdisciplinary event where researchers, academics, and practitioners converge to share research findings, exchange ideas, and discuss advancements in both Nonlinear Complex Systems and Computational Intelligence. This synthesis encourages a collaborative environment that bridges mathematical intricacies and AI-driven solutions to real-world challenges.  
 This conference will focus on:   
 Nonlinear systems and their complex nature 
  Chaos and synchronization 
  Numerical analysis and the development of algorithms for simulation 
  Scientific computing and their applications 
  Machine and deep learning 
  Data driven model 
  Fluid dynamics 
  Fuzzy inference system 
  Mathematical biological model

 The Nature and Use of Surveillance Technologies in Residential Care    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.1-9 

 To support an aging population there has been a move towards developing surveillance technologies that observe the movements, behaviours and health status of older people. These technologies are meant to support health and independence within the context of limited resources. Although there have been studies about the development of new devices and systems, there has been less research examining the impact of surveillance technologies that monitor those residing and working in care facilities. This paper reports the findings from a qualitative study of a residential care facility that instituted video surveillance. The findings revealed how surveillance was used as a care management tool – to provide access to real-time data, to preserve the safety of older people and to monitor the working practices of formal carers. However, there may also be some unintended consequences of the implementation of video surveillance in residential care.   

 Sensors on My Bed: The Ups and Downs of In-Home Monitoring    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.10-18 

 Australia’s increasing aged population is associated with rises in health expenditure and residential care costs, creating a public health challenge. This challenge can be met with in-home monitoring systems that allow older people to live at home longer. There is, however, a dearth of knowledge on how Australians feel about being monitored. Here we describe an ongoing study conducted with elderly residents as part of a smart home pilot. We aim to identify perceptions of the sensor-based in-home monitoring system throughout the pilot, from conception to completion. In this paper, we provide our preliminary findings of initial reactions to the technology and contributions made by prospective residents at pre-pilot workshops. We found participants favoured system flexibility and enhanced family communication and that undesirable aspects could be circumvented or solved by our researchers. Much of the participant feedback was incorporated into the design of the pilot and the associated technologies.   

 Corridor Sensor Arrays for Dementia Group Home    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.19-26 

 This paper describes a trial detection system to monitor the behavior of patients walking along the corridor of a group home for dementia patients. Generally, we do not install video cameras, in order to protect the privacy of the residents. We have developed a simple linear array sensor to detect the behavior of a person walking along the corridor. We have deployed these linear array sensors at a group home where 27 patients are living together. This paper provides an explanation on the sensors and the entire information system.

  pp.27-35 

 SmartPhones can play a significant role in maintaining decent a Quality of Life for elderly people. There are numerous solutions available on SmartPhones that can assist the elderly in their activities of daily living, however these solutions are sometimes not welcomed in elderly community due to usability and accessibility factors. In this paper, we present PhonAge, an accessible & adaptable solution for SmartPhones that can host diverse useful services to elderly people. The first stage user evaluation results shows the usability of our solution.

 Extracting Intra- and Inter-activity Association Patterns from Daily Routines of Elders    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.36-44 

 One of the most challenging issues faced by many elders is the over-decreasing independence mainly caused by impaired physical, cognitive, and/or sensory abilities. Activity recognition can be used to help elders live longer in their own homes independently, by providing assurance of safety, instructing performance of activity and assessing cognitive status. In this work, we propose to discover both intra- and inter-activity association patterns from daily routines of elderly people. Specifically, a data mining method is proposed to extract the most frequent sequential sequences of steps inside each individual activity (i.e., intra-activity pattern) and activities (i.e., inter-activity pattern) of a set of daily activities. These patterns can then be used to model human daily activities for activity recognition purpose, or to directly instruct/prompt elders with impaired memory when they perform daily routines. The experimental results conducted on two individuals’ datasets of daily activities show that our proposed approach is workable to discover these association patterns.   

 A Wavelet Feature Based Mechanomyography Classification System for a Wearable Rehabilitation System for the Elderly    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.45-52 

 This paper proposes a pattern recognition based system for identification of the forearm movements using Mechanomyography(MMG) for the rehabilitation of the elderly. The system is used to assist in the relearning and rehabilitation of the movements of the wrist and the hand. Surface MMG signals acquired from the flexor carpi ulnaris, brachioradialis supinator and abductor pollicis longus. The MMG is processed and wavelet based features are extracted which are classified into eight different forearm movements using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier. A classification efficiency of 90.2 % is achieved using the MLP classifier. The MMG system is designed to measure data using accelerometers built into the assistive device and, hence, doesn’t require any active involvement of the elderly.

  pp.53-60 

 The number of elderly people, who are unable to live independently and need assistance due to cognitive impairment, will rise rapidly in the aging society. To assist the independent living of these individuals and decrease the caregiver burden have become an important public health concern in the future. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognitive function and dementia. The symptoms of MCI include difficulty remembering recent events or recently acquired information, depression and anxiety. MCI also increases the fall risk and affects patients’ social function and behavior. Sufficient physical activities can improve health of brain and reduce the risk of MCI. Since the context-aware computing technologies for assisting living have gained great popularity. We proposed a context-based activity prompting system to improve quality of life for MCI patients. The proposed system utilizes a smart phone as a sensor device to transmit sensing data to cloud server for activity recognition and activity level estimation, and uses context-based technique to provide activity prompting message to MCI patients. The activity prompting service supplies the activities self-management for MCI patients and helps them living independently. The system also provides real time fall detection mechanism to shorten the rescue time when accident happened. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed system achieves high accuracy on activity recognition and activity level estimation.   

 Behavior Recognition for Elderly People in Large-Scale Deployment    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  Inclusive Society: Health & Well being in Ageing-friendly Community, - eHealth, Telemedicine, Chronic Disease Management & Care at Home 
  pp.56 

 Behavior recognition through ambient assisted living solutions for elderly people, represents an ambitious challenge for actimetry. Numerous and versatile solutions have been deployed. However, a commercial adoption is still pending, due to scalability and acceptability constraints. Most researches in ambient assisted living appear to have an heavy design, where precise features are first selected, and hardware architecture is designed accordingly. Although it may provide interesting results, such approach leads to a lack of scalability. This is why we experimented a lighter approach for a real deployment. The complexity is shifted from hardware to software, and we aim to make meaningful informations emerge from simple and generic sensor data, in order to recognize abnormal and dangerous situations. In this paper, we will describe how to retrieve consistent informations, so that resident's behavior may be observed, and that a light and generic approach fits in large scale deployments, with acceptable cost and scalability.   

 Towards a Context Aware Modeling of Trust and Access Control Based on the User Behavior and Capabilities

 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.69-76 

 During the last decade, several context based security models has been proposed to take into account the user behavior aspect. However the studied context is mainly related to device and spatio-temporal features, which may led to a weak and inappropriate contextual modeling. By using the huge and various contextual data issued from the sensors deployed in smart environments, our objective is to provide a security framework suitable for dependant people. This paper shows our approach to model both trust and access control based on the deduced user behavior and capabilities.

  pp.77-85 

 With the rise of Healthcare IT infrastructures, the need of healthcare data sharing and integration has become extremely important. Cloud computing paradigm is one of the most popular healthcare IT infrastructures for facilitating electronic health record sharing and integration. Many predict that managing healthcare applications with clouds will make revolutionary change in the way we do healthcare today. Enabling the access to ubiquitous healthcare not only will help us improve healthcare as our data will always be accessible from anywhere at any time, but also it helps cutting down the costs drastically. However, since healthcare data contains lots of sensitive private information, how to protect data privacy within the untrusted cloud is facing a huge challenge. Thus, a mechanism to protect the privacy of healthcare data is needed when these data are stored and processed within the cloud to provide various medical services. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a generic framework named PriGen that preserves the privacy of sensitive healthcare data in the cloud. PriGen allows the users to preserve privacy while accessing cloud based healthcare service without the help of a trusted third party. With making use of homomorphic encryption function on sensitive private information; our proposed framework maintains confidentiality of private information sent by the cloud users to untrusted cloud based healthcare service providers. In this paper, we also present a brief discussion of different components of PriGen framework.

 The pervasiveness of location acquisition technologies has significantly elevated the demands of experience sharing recommendation systems. These systems are highly affected by social dynamicity and trends which are not exploited in existing studies. In this paper, we have proposed a GPS trajectory focused approach that endorses interesting locations. Tree based hierarchical clusters of visited locations are utilized to incorporate the timely changing social trends and personalized preferences of the users. Experimental studies are conducted on real world dataset for verification and validity of the proposed technique.

 This paper introduces the two types of supporting technology for wheelchair users. One is the intuitive interface for electric wheelchair user. The other is step climbing mechanism for manual wheelchair users. In order to realize intuitive interface, we adopt to use human body motion interface. From the experiment, it turned out that proposed interface has a potential for providing intuitive operation. For manual wheelchair users, we propose the assistive caster unit for step climbing. This Caster unit has two functions, one is the assistive plate and the other is lock function. The assistive plate makes easy step climbing. The lock function enables to climb a step form oblique approach. For the experiment, the proposed caster unit could reduce user’s driving force, namely it could assist manual wheelchair users.

  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.126-133 

 Pervasive computing has emerged as a viable solution capable of providing technology-driven assistive living for elderly. The pervasive healthcare system, CARA(Context Aware Real-time Assistant), is designed to provide personalized healthcare services for elderly in a timely and appropriate manner by adapting the healthcare technology to fit in with normal activities of the elderly and working practices of the caregivers. The work in this paper introduces a personalized, flexible and extensible hybrid reasoning framework for CARA system in a smart home environment which provides context-aware sensor data fusion as well as anomaly detection mechanisms that supports Activity of Daily Living(ADL) analysis and alert generation. We study how the incorporation of rule-based and case-based reasoning enables CARA to become more robust and to adapt to a changing environment by continuously retraining with new cases. Case study for evaluation of this hybrid reasoning framework is carried out under simulated but realistic smart home scenarios. The results indicate the feasibility of the framework for effective at-home monitoring.

  11th International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 

 As the number of elderly people living worldwide and average life expectancy increases, older adults' safety assurance has become increasingly important. There are many works on safety issues of the elderly focusing on human activity classification. Most of them use external sensor devices and/or completely or partially user input based classification and prediction systems. In this paper, we have developed an algorithmic model, monitored and documented elderlypeoplès daily activities by using the gyroscope and accelerometer of a smartphone and with the use of those data and model, we calculated how much activity is required or overdone for a subject in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. More importantly, we built a real time system that could not only judge what basic activity the subject is currently doing, but also protect the subject from possible injury that might happen to the subject if abnormal data is received.   

 Ambient Assistive Healthcare and Wellness Management – Is “The Wisdom of the Body” Transposable to One’s Home?    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.143-150 

 To cope with the issues of population aging and lack of homecare providers, ambient assistive technologies seem to be a way to explore. Domotics have already flooded our daily living allowing to program the garden watering, the blind opening, the house temperature…They are however ill-suited for the elderly because of their complexity in use. To address elderly needs and lighten the caregiver’s burden, this preliminary study proposes a complete architecture of ambient assistive healthcare and wellness at home, whose main innovation is that it differs from the existing ones by its active feature. Indeed, it is not necessary to program all the home facilities one-by-one any longer, they are all centralized and remote-controlled by the system proposed. Moreover, this smart household control system is automatic, unsupervised and entirely adaptive to the user’s needs and wishes. It provides optimum home conditions to ensure the inhabitant wellness in accordance with the monitoring of his/her physiological and behavioral variables.

 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.151-158 

 There has been renewal of interest in green technologies due to deteriorating global warming, which renders energy saving (ES) becoming increasingly important. By recognizing users‘ on-going activities in a smart home environment, we propose an interruptiblity-aware ES reminder system to facilitate behavioral changes for facilitating energy saving at home. This system provides an ES reminder (one kind of eco-feedback) in the event of an activity transition to avoid constantly disturbing user’s on-going activities, and the content of an ES reminder is composed using two kinds of information visualization via ambient displays to improve readability. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative evaluations, the system can help lead to pro-environmental behaviors in a more human-centric way.

 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  11th International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics, ICOST 2013 

 Thermal comfort is an essential aspect for the control and verification of many smart home services. In this research, we design and implement simulation which models thermal environment of a smart house testbed. Our simulation can be used to evaluate thermal comfort in various conditions of home environment. In order to increase the accuracy of the simulation, we measure thermal-related parameters of the house such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation by the use of sensors and perform parameter identification to estimate uncertain parameters in our thermal model. We also implement a communication interface which allows our simulator to communicate with other external simulators. Experimental result showed that our simulation can achieve high accuracy when compared with actual measurement data.   

 Force Efficient Analysis of a Hybrid Magnetic Actuation System for Minimally Invasive Diagnostics and Interventions    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  ICOST 2013 - 11th International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 

 Minimally invasive diagnostics and interventions (MIDI) are emerging as major paradigm shifts in medical technology development and thus significant for elder care. Magnetic or electromagnetic guided devices have been introduced to MIDI due to the remote maneuverability which is critical to control and track the intracorporeal instruments. A category of magnetic actuation mechanism is investigated by the authors based on hybrid magnetic bearing (HMB) that can provide force suspension and locomotion. In this paper, force coefficient is investigated during the locomotion control using HMB. The force coefficient refers to the distribution ratio of permanent magnetic force and electromagnetic force in HMB. According to the definition of force coefficient, it can be concluded that the larger force coefficient is, and then the smaller power loss is.   

 Assessing Behavioral Responses in Persuasive Ubiquitous Systems    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jun 2013 
  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.176-186 

 Existing telehealth systems do not perform as effectively as would be expected due to their asymmetric focus on sensing and monitoring with little support or assurance to affecting or altering behaviors. Many people, especially the elderly, are resistant to change. Such resistance diminishes the efficacy of telehealth systems. Research and supportive technology for intervention and behavior alteration is urgently needed. In response, we developed the Action-based Behavior Model (ABM) that promotes persuasion and enables persuasive telehealth. However, ABM requires an assessment of user behavior responsiveness and compliance to cyber influence. There are many challenging problems that must be overcome to enable such assessment. In this paper, we propose Assess Tree (AT) as a methodology for domain specific behavior assessment under ABM. We present AT and report on preliminary validation.

  pp.187-197 

 The recent introduction of the serious games technology in medical education allows dispatching the health knowledge in communities not actually still concerned by the e-learning. The medical cyber-universities are giving essentially primary knowledge to medical students and continuing education for MP’s, the paramedics being only a secondary target. The patient is rarely considered as a prior customer of the medical e-learning, but the increase of the chronic diseases as those emerging from the sequence overweight-obesity-diabetes of type 2 or from contamination spread facilitated by the new transportation modalities, with complex mode of propagation depending on their contagious (social or infectious) character, pushes to conceive active e-learning tools including a bio-feedback from the patient susceptible to increase its knowledge, level of responsibility, reactivity, compliance and observance with respect to the acute or long-term therapy and prevention policy concerning its disease. The paper presents the serious game as a user-friendly tool susceptible to serve the objective of e-therapy education at home for patients suffering of long term chronic diseases.

  International Conference on Smart Homes and Health Telematics 
  pp.198-204 

 This work describes the use of smart homes to assess the health and wellbeing of people by measuring and displaying their activity at home. This is accomplished by the use of motion sensors, switches, pulse counters and touch screen displays. Pulse counters keep track of events and paths. An event is the triggering of a sensor, and a path is the distance between two sensors. There are counters for measuring positive and negative activities. Activities like walking, pedaling a static bicycle, and showering are displayed hourly, daily, and monthly with the same displays used for metering water and electricity. The activity patterns show hours of quietness, sleeping time, time without activity and their interruptions, like waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. Several hours of continuos inactivity during the day may trigger a panic call in the burglar alarm central, requesting a call back.

  pp.205-210 

 Elderly care is facing the challenge of the disequilibrium between the increased number of old people and the low number of personnel in the elderly care. The emerging pervasive technology has revolutionised the way of assistance in elderly care. Current solutions usually focus too much on technology, and fail to address the usability issues. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive system for both elderly care providers and elders. The system enables coordinators to manage care-givers and elders in an efficient way to improve service quality. For instance, care-givers can be scheduled in a real-time manner with mobile phones. We also deploy several sensors in their homes to monitor daily routines to ensure their safety. Alerts will be sent and accessible by coordinators immediately once detected, then elderly care services can be provided accordingly. We test our system in a real home for over 2 months. Finally, we offer a statistical study about the collected data and the reported alerts.

 Much of the literature on smart homes, smart living and eHealth focuses on either technology issues, such as home automation and sensor technology or the acceptance and adoption of smart home services. However, even smart home services that are technologically feasible and acceptable are not taken off as end-users cannot find them in today's fragmented marketplace with an overload of information. Basically there is a demand and supply mismatch. We argue that a matchmaking or brokering platform is required that helps end-users to search for smart living services and on the other hand support (service) providers promoting their products. In this paper, we propose a conceptual design for such a platform based on two series of exploratory interviews with stakeholders in the domain.   

 Identifying Factors for Human Desire Inference in Smart Home Environments

  pp.230-237 

 To date, there have been numerous studies focusing on how user’s activity can be identified and predicted without considering motivation driving an action. However, understanding the underlying motivation is a key to activity analysis. On the other hand, user’s desires often generate motivations to engage activities in order to fulfill such desires. Thus, we must study user’s desires in order to provide proper services to make the life of users more comfortable. In this paper, we describe what possible factors are relevant to determining user’s desire. To achieve this, a full-scale experiment has been conducted. Raw data from sensors were interpreted as context information. We observed the user’s activities and get user’s emotions as a part of inference parameters. Throughout the experiment, a complete analysis was conducted whereas 30 factors were considered and most relevant factors were selectively chosen using correlation coefficient and delta value. Our preliminary results show that 11 factors (3 emotions, 7 behaviors and 1 location) are relevant to inferring user’s desire. By applying such factors into Dynamic Bayesian Network to infer desire, both complexity and scalability as our biggest research challenges can be more adequately tackled.

 Elderly suffers from injuries or disabilities through falls every year. With a high likelihood of falls causing serious injury or death, falling can be extremely dangerous, especially when the victim is home-alone and is unable to seek timely medical assistance. Our fall detection systems aims to solve this problem by automatically detecting falls and notify healthcare services or the victim’s caregivers so as to provide help. In this paper, development of a fall detection system based on Kinect sensor is introduced. Current fall detection algorithms were surveyed and we developed a novel posture recognition algorithm to improve the specificity of the system. Data obtained through trial testing with human subjects showed a 26.5% increase in fall detection compared to control algorithms. With our novel detection algorithm, the system conducted in a simulated ward scenario can achieve up to 90% fall detection rate.

 Human activity has a life cycle that could be tracked to provide crucial information that increases activity recognition performance. Life cycle tracking also enables powerful and more versatile programming models over the sentience of human activities. This paper introduces a new activity recognition approach that is based on fuzzy logic and activity life cycle tracking. We conduct preliminary performance validation and show how activity life cycle tracking offers higher accuracy when compared to the traditional approach of no-life cycle activity recognition.

 Falls in the elderly is a major public health problem because of their frequency and their medical and social consequences. New smart assistive technologies and Health Telematics make it possible to provide elderly with more security and well being at home. A smart home can automatically monitor home activities for early warning in health changes or detecting dangerous situations. One of our objectives is to design an automatic system to detect fall at home, which in its final version will be made up of a network of RGB-D sensors. In this paper, we present a simple and robust method based on the identification and tracking of the center of mass of people evolving in an indoor environment. Using a simple Hidden Markov Model whose observations are the position of the center of mass, its velocity and the general shape of the body, we can surprisingly monitor the activity of a person with high accuracy and thus detect falls with very good accuracy without false positives. An experimental study, that is reported here, has been driven in our smart apartment lab. 26 subjects were asked to perform a predefined scenario in which they realized a set of eight postures. 2 hours of video (216 000 frames) were recorded for the evaluation, half of it being used for the training of the model. The system detected the falls without false positives. This result encourages us to use this system in real situation for a better study of its efficiency.

 Locomotion is a feature of all animals. Whereas quadruped are fast and stable, human’s bipedal gait is less stable and less efficient. Human gait analysis is going on for a long time. Such analysis usually used force data applied on the ground during different phases of gait. In this paper, we have analyzed the pressure data collected from pressure sensors placed on shoes along with accelerometer data collected from cell phones during walking activity. We identified different phases of walking activity using the pressure data. We also have developed a biomechanical model of gait based on the pressure and acceleration data.

 Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is becoming as one of the key components of current health information systems. Contemporary CDSS system requires more attention to design and implement. The crucial aspect of KB is the richness with respect to domain knowledge which is mainly dependent on domain experts. Domain experts have understanding of the domain and wisdom to create the knowledge. However, they often seek help from online knowledge resources to find new evidences about certain disease and clinical practices. This fact is especially true for cancer disease where improvements occur more frequently. Literature has proved that online knowledge resources are capable providing answers to questions that might not be answered relying only on clinician wisdom and experience. This paper provides the technique for meaningful integration of online knowledge resources with Smart CDSS. Clinicians can get enormous benefits from this approach to fulfill the gaps in the decisions during patients’ diagnosis and treatment.

 The worldwide population has been aging at an accelerated rate. The main factor has been attributed to this process is the life expectancy. The old people are the most susceptible age rate to contract chronic diseases. In most cases they need to take a lot of medicines daily. Therefore it is really hard to handle with different medicine schedules, especially, when the elderly has been living alone. Therewith, we propose a pervasive health environment for medical treatment at home wherein the family and/or close friends are characterized as remotely caregivers.

 With growing aging population around the world, there is urgent need of effective solution to improve the quality of life of demented elderly. In order to provide real-time monitoring and timely assistance to elderly in their home settings, we designed and developed a system employing model-based scenario verification, sensing-assisted activity recognition and semantic service reasoning. In this paper, we present the results achieved and lessons learned from conducting clinical trials with our developed solution at a dementia hostel. From trial data analysis, we could determine good system performance but no concrete evidences obtained on how the daily care operations and quality can be improved. Especially, we gained technical experiences and learned usability issues from end-user perspectives that could lead to designing and developing better elderly care solutions in near future.

 Aging is associated with an increased risk of isolation. Interpersonal communication with family members, friends, and caregivers is crucial to healthy aging. This paper presents a telepresence robot “TRiCmini+” which can be used as an agent of the children or caregivers in an older adult’s home environment, to duplicate three dimensional face-to-face interpersonal communications. TRiCmini+ can be separated into the “brain (a tablet)” and the “body (the robotic vehicle)”. With this structure, the robot control software is an App which can be downloaded, maintained and updated easily through the Internet. TRiCmini+ is integrated with social network services such as Google Talk and Facebook, to provide a wide range of communication and information sharing easily and conveniently. The effectiveness of using TRiCmini+ in communication is evaluated. The results showed that the telepresence performance in both verbal and nonverbal ways is better than the traditional telepresence robot without nonverbal way of interpersonal communication.

  pp.310-315 

 The “Daily Care Journal” is a platform that aims at allowing a care taker to stay at home as long as possible. This should be achieved by providing means to build and coordinate care networks between professional and informal care givers, including the care taker. It allows the informal care to document their measures and observations. Additionally it provides care related information that might strengthen the informal care. Synchronized with a professional care information system it allows both, the professional and informal care givers, to exchange care related information with each other and to coordinate their activities. One key technology is the usage of a tablet pc that allows the care taker to document and to actively build and take part of his care network. The “Daily Care Journal” has been developed and evaluated together with a professional care provider.

 This study surveys a range of devices and applications based on information and computer technologies to automate their control houses and related activities which together form and are called Smart Home systems. The aim of this research is to explore examples of such devices and applications used to provide smart home technologies and their benefits and challenges to users. Interviews were administered to 18 users of Smart Home technologies. The participants were selected randomly by purposive sampling on the basis of having and using a smart home technology, and with the goal of ascertaining which type of the technologies are being used, their modus operandi, and their benefits and any implementation issues. This was complemented by exploring the systems through watching and observing online videos of people using them. The findings reveal a varied number of Smart Home systems being used for automating household operations. The primary reasons for using them are their efficiency and simplicity of operation in spite of being challenged by their high costs. In relative order, the greatest perceived benefits of a smart home system for the participants were convenience, energy savings, the security it can provide, and simplicity of control. The greatest challenges were cost, design aspects, technical challenges and lacking in meeting special user needs.

 Touch screens have a delay between user input and corresponding visual interface feedback, called input 'latency' (or 'lag'). Visual latency is more noticeable during continuous input actions like dragging, so methods to display feedback based on the most likely path for the next few input points have been described in research papers and patents. Designing these 'next-point prediction' methods is challenging, and there have been no standard metrics to compare different approaches. We introduce metrics to quantify the probability of 7 spatial error 'side-effects' caused by next-point prediction methods. Types of side-effects are derived using a thematic analysis of comments gathered in a 12 participants study covering drawing, dragging, and panning tasks using 5 state-of-the-art next-point predictors. Using experiment logs of actual and predicted input points, we develop quantitative metrics that correlate positively with the frequency of perceived side-effects. These metrics enable practitioners to compare next-point predictors using only input logs.

  Asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease with a high number of admissions and emergency room visits in pediatric hospitals. Treatment of asthmatic patients is best done by asthma specialists and requires the chronic use of prophylactic medications, additional treatment for acute exacerbations and regular check-ups. In Crete, a Greek island, there are many children with asthma who are ... [Show full abstract]  not receiving care by an asthma specialist. The only specialty clinic for asthmatic children in Crete is in Heraklion, a city in the center of the island. We attempted to use telemedicine in order to reach and follow children with asthma who live in distant areas in Crete. We set up a pilot telemedicine program with 10 asthmatic children already followed at the Specialty Clinic. Using teleconferencing techniques, we were able to obtain the medical history, examine the patients, educate them about the disease and adjust the treatment. The parents of patients accepted the telemedicine service with a percentage of 90% and showed a special interest in this new service. We conclude that telemedicine for asthmatic children performed by their specialist is feasible and accepted by the majority of patients.

 A Discussion of Involvement of Pharmacists in Home Medical Care in Foreign Countries and Internation...

 Tokuko Okuda 
  In an aging society, the sustainability of the public medical system is the most important factor. I surveyed leading cases in Japan, as well as corresponding cases overseas. I also conducted interviews in Britain, North America, and Europe, and these indicated the current trends and issues. The UK has a universal insurance system and, facing a declining birthrate and an aging population, they ... [Show full abstract]  have adopted a policy of immigration, which has various problems. However, the GP system is highly regarded by the OECD. Denmark has also introduced a similar medical system and they are implementing social security policies based on ICT. Sweden managed to cover an extreme shortage of pharmacists by adopting several policies. The U. S., under the pressures of their current health insurance system, is now shifting to preventive and early intervention by cultivating public consciousness in this area. In comparison, there is no country like Japan, which has a serious problem of an increasingly aging population, and where pharmacists play important roles in home care. However, leading overseas cases are worth learning from.

 Beyond Power/Knowledge an exploration of the relation of power, ignorance and stupidity   
 January 2006    
 David Graeber 
  Let me begin with a brief story about bureaucracy. Over the last year my mother had a series of strokes. It soon became obvious that she would eventually be incapable of living at home without assistance; since her insurance would not cover home care, a series of social workers advised us to put in for Medicaid. To qualify for Medicaid however, one's total worth can only amount to six thousand ... [Show full abstract]  dollars. We arranged to transfer her savings—this was, I suppose, technically a scam, though it's a peculiar sort of scam since the government employs thousands of social workers whose main work seems to be telling citizens how to do it—but shortly thereafter, she had another, very serious stroke, and found herself in a nursing home undergoing long-term rehabilitation. When she emerged from there she would definitely need home care, but there was a problem: her social security check was being deposited directly, she was barely able to sign her name, so unless I acquired power of attorney over her account and was thus able to pay her monthly rent bills for her, the money would immediately build up and disqualify her, even after I filled out the enormous raft of Medicaid documents I needed to file to qualify her for pending status. I went to her bank, picked up the requisite forms, and brought them to the nursing home. The documents needed to be notarized. The nurse on the floor informed me there was an in-house notary, but I needed to make an appointment; she picked up the phone and put me through to a disembodied voice, who then transferred me to the notary. The notary proceeded to inform me I first had to get authorization from the head of social work, and hung up. So I acquired his name and room number and duly took the elevator downstairs, appeared at his office—only to discover he was, in fact, the disembodied voice on the phone. The head of social work picked up the phone, said "Marjorie, that was me, you're driving this man crazy with this nonsense and you're driving me crazy too", and proceeded to secure me an appointment for early the next week. The next week the notary duly appeared, accompanied me upstairs, made sure I'd filled out my side of the form (as had been repeatedly emphasized to me), and then, in my mother's presence, proceeded to fill out her own. I was a little puzzled that she didn't ask my mother to sign anything, only me, but I figured she must know what she was doing. The next day I took it to the bank, where the woman at the desk took one look, asked why my mother hadn't signed it, and showed it to her manager, who told me to take it back and do it right. Apparently the notary had no idea what she was doing. So I got new

 Piotr Augustyniak 
  The aim of the paper is to present of a prototype of wearable heart rate variability (HRV) monitor. The home care surveillance and sleep assessment system is partly embedded into a smart home infrastructure and partly worn by a supervised person. The prototype wearable device is designed to acquire and process the electrocardiogram and to send reports accordingly to a programmed schedule. The ... [Show full abstract]  recording, processing and transmission modes are programmable, what allows the recorder to respond immediately in case of predefined thresholds excess, while the regular reporting is organized in delayed packets exchanged during a short transmission session. This approach significantly reduces the contribution to the total power consumption from the communication module. The prototype was based on the PXA-270 development kit, but due to very low power consumption (0,5 mW) the migration to a more compact system is considered.

 Long-term services in Mexico: homes for the aged   
 November 1987  · Danish Medical Bulletin    
 E C Contreras de Lehr 
  Accurate statistics are not available about the number of people in institutions for the aged in Mexico, but the majority are assumed to live with their family or on their own and to be integrated with the community. However, the increase of Mexico's aging population, from its present more than 4 million to 12 million people over 60 years of age in the year 2025, together with the decreased ... [Show full abstract]  population growth rate (3.5% in the early seventies; approximately 2.5% currently, and 1% in the year 2000) will considerably increase the demand for health care and services for this sector of the population. Nursing Homes should be not only shelters, but should help to raise or maintain the quality for life of elderly people in all areas: physical, psychological, and social. In the near future, it will be necessary not only to build more homes for the aged, but to develop and implement other forms of care that will allow the elderly to remain integrated with the community. Through home care and substitute homes, families that take care of their elderly relatives can be helped; and direct assistance can be give to old people who wish to be independent.

  RÉSUMÉ Il y a eu peu d’études qui se concentrent sur les chutes chez les clients qui reçoivent des soins à domicile (SD) avec des conditions neurologiques. Cette étude a identifié les facteurs qui accroissent le risque de chutes chez les clients SD sans histoire récente de telles chutes, et a exploré si les profils de risque variaient parmi les personnes atteintes de démence ou le parkinsonisme, ... [Show full abstract]  par rapport à celles sans conditions neurologiques sélectionnés. Une étude de cohorte rétrospective a été utilisée, et l’analyse des données provenant de clients SD communautaires de l’Ontario a été menée sur un échantillon de clients ambulatoires atteints de démence, de parkinsonisme, ou d’aucune des conditions neurologiques sélectionnées. Les données ont été obtenues à partir de l’instrument d’évaluation des résidents en soins à domicile (IERSD-SD). Dans l’analyse multivariée, le résultat utilisé était de savoir si les clients ont tombé au cours du suivi. Une démarche instable était un fort prédicteur des chutes dans les trois groupes. Le parkinsonisme co-morbide a prédit plus fortement les chutes dans le groupe de démence. Les clients qui ont montré la limite intacte à la déficience cognitive légère étaient plus susceptibles de se sont trouvés dans les groupes de parkinsonisme et de comparaison. Les chances de tomber étaient plus élevées pour les clients avec la limite intacte à la déficience cognitive légère qui également faisaient partie des groupes de la maladie de Parkinson et de comparaison.

  Optical motion capture systems, which are used in broad fields of research, are costly; they need large installation space and calibrations. We find difficulty in applying it in typical homes and care centers. Therefore we propose to use low cost contact force measurement systems to develop rehabilitation and healthcare monitoring tools. Here, we propose a novel algorithm for motion recognition ... [Show full abstract]  using the feature vector from force data solely obtained during a daily exercise program. We recognized 7 types of movement of 2 candidates. The results show that the recognition rate of each motion has high score. The results also confirm that there is a clustering of each movement in personal exercise data, and a similarity of the clustering even for different candidates thus that motion recognition is possible using contact force data.

  The growing number of elderly individuals presents new challenges for society. Many elderly individuals have physical or cognitive impairments and require support from caregivers. An attempt to overcome the limitations caused by the lack of human caregivers is the inclusion of assistive technology such as socially active robots. The Domeo-project of the Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme of ... [Show full abstract]  the European Union aims to develop a new companion robotic system that would allow assistance to the elderly. The requirements and attitude of the potential users and caregivers have been assessed in Austria, France and Hungary. The robot functions were demonstrated to the participants. Three focus groups were formed: potential end users, older caregivers and younger caregivers. The discussions were recorded and processed according to six aspects: (i) acceptability and privacy, (ii) pertinence of services, (iii) possible obstacles, (iv) motivation level to use the proposed services, (v) organizational issues and (vi) recommendations. Minor differences were observed between the countries, but there were considerable differences regarding the age of the participants. The younger caregivers want to be assured of the safety of their client and to receive immediate notification in case of an emergency. As for the elderly, the most important aspect is to gain a companion and a physical helper. Many of the recommendations can be taken into consideration during robot development, but some of them are not realistic at present.

  One major challenge to successful aging is the capability to preserve health, or from another perspective to avoid disease. Unfortunately, a large percentage of the elderly people are living with chronic diseases or disabilities. Home care technologies and other emerging technologies have the potential to play a major role in home-based health care approach. The main goal of the presented ... [Show full abstract]  research in this paper is to develop a cost-effective user-friendly telemedicine system to serve the elderly and disabled people in the community, and to establish a continuous communication link between patients and caregivers and allow physicians to offer help when needed. Hence, we are presenting here an integrated user-friendly model of a smart home which provides telemedicine for elderly at home. The paper focuses on implementation details and practical considerations of integrating the diverse technologies into a working system.

  In this study, we propose a novel context-based location aware algorithm for identification of low-level micro-activities that can be used to derive complex Activities of Daily Living (ADL) performed by home-care patients. This is achieved by gathering location information of the target user using a wearable beacon embedded with magnetometer and inertial sensors. The shortcomings of the beacon ... [Show full abstract]  signal stability and mismatch issues in magnetic field sequences are overcome by adopting a hybrid three-phase approach for deducing the locus of micro-activities and their associated zones in a smart home environment. The suggested approach is assessed in two different test environments where the main intention is to map the location of a person performing an activity with pre-defined house landmarks and zones in the offline labelled database. In addition to recognition of low-level activities, the proposed method also identifies the person's walking trajectory within the same zone or between different zones of the house. Experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve centimeter-level accuracy for recognition of micro-activities and a classification accuracy of 85% for trajectory prediction. These results are encouraging and imply that collection of accurate low-level information for ADL recognition is possible through integration of inertial sensors, magnetic field and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technologies from the wearable without relying on other infrastructural sensors.

 Contracting Out Public Services: The Need and Necessity of Government Intervention for Safeguarding...

  The Western welfare states are under reform (Pierson 1996; Gilbert 2002; Taylor-Gooby 2004; Henman and Fenger 2006). An important part of those reforms is the introduction of forms of privatization. Over the last decade, in most Western countries private elements have been introduced in (former) public sectors such as health care, home care, public transport, and social security. One of the ... [Show full abstract]  components of the welfare state that has been subjected to privatization is the provision of public services. Over the years, many countries have chosen to contract out public service delivery (Domberger and Jensen 1997; Majone 1997; Scott 2000). The contracting out of public services is a specific form of privatization. In the case of contracting out, the production or the provision of public services is commissioned to the market. As a result, the role of the state changes from public provider to buyer of public services. Underlying the notion of contracting out is the belief that the introduction of market elements in the production of public services increases effectiveness and efficiency (Raad voor Werk en Inkomen 2003; Van Berkel and Van der Aa 2005). However, as we will explain in section two, this expectation only holds under specific circumstances. When contracting out public services, the agency that is outsourcing is faced with several challenges, such as opportunistic behavior on the part of the supplier. It may turn out to be difficult and costly to have the contractor supply according to the agency's preferences and policies. More specifically, the question arises whether contracts are sufficient for the safeguarding of public interests or whether supplementary government intervention is required. By analyzing the contracting practices of reintegration services in the Dutch reintegration market, we hope to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of public private contract relations and the extend to which it is possible to safeguard public interests within the contract relation.

 Scope    

 The 45 th  IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss and exchange cutting edge ideas as well as the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will be held over July 20-23 rd  , 2025 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025.  

 Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:  

  Cloud Computing 

  Distributed Algorithms 

  Big Data, Models & Systems 

  Distributed Fault Tolerance 

  Distributed OS and Middleware 

  Edge Computing 

  IoT + CPS 

  Mobile Computing 

  Security, Privacy and Trust 

  Blockchains/Databases 

  Distributed Systems for AI/ML 

  AI/ML for Distributed Systems 

  Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures 

 Paper Submission   

 The Paper strand provides  the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.  

 Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template (downloadable by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE-Template Selector https://template-selector.ieee.org/  ). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages  (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.  

 The paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts and data needed for the reproduction of their results.  

 For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.  

 Note that the authors should adhere to ethic and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics  and IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text.   

 Note  : A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS)  . The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.

 ICORES is sponsored by INSTICC  – Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication  
    
  SCOPE  
 The purpose of the International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES) is to bring together researchers, engineers, faculty, and practitioners interested in both theoretical advances and practical applications in the field of operations research. Two simultaneous tracks will be held, covering on one side domain independent methodologies and technologies and on the other side practical work developed in specific application areas.  
   
  ICORES focuses on real world challenges; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of Operations Research Methodologies and Technologies for industry and services, either in general or for particular applications. Ideas on how to solve specific business problems as well as larger enterprise challenges, using operations research methodologies and technologies, will arise from the conference. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, case studies, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICORES. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both formal oral presentations and informal poster sessions.  
   
  Special sessions focused on case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials for technical/scientific topics and practical applications are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in offering a tutorial are invited to contact the conference secretariat.   
   
  CONFERENCE AREAS  
 Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas:   
 1  . METHODOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES   
  2  . APPLICATIONS   

  AREA 1: METHODOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES   
  
  Business Analytics/Management Sciences

 International Conference on Program Comprehension 2025  
   
 The 33rd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2025) is the premier venue for work in the area of program comprehension. It encompasses both human activities for comprehending the software and technologies for supporting such comprehension. ICPC 2025 promises to provide a quality forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present and to discuss state-of-the-art results and best practices in the field of program comprehension. ICPC 2025 is co-located with ICSE 2025  .  
 ICPC 2025 solicits four main categories of research contributions: research papers, early research achievement (ERA) papers, replications and negative results papers, and tool demos. On top of this, journal first papers from selected journals will be accepted for presentation. Research papers describe original work in the area of program comprehension; ERA papers report early research results with the main goal of fostering discussion at the conference. Replications and negative results papers concerned with the re-execution of existing research aimed at strengthening previous findings as well as the presentation of sound empirical methods leading to negative results. Finally, tool demonstrations report about new instruments making available and usable to practitioners’ program comprehension methods.

 About ICPE  
 The International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) originated 16 years ago from the fusion of an ACM workshop on software and performance prediction and a SPEC workshop focused on benchmarking and performance evaluation.  
 ICPE continues true to its origins with focus both on software performance modeling, prediction, and measurement as well as on benchmark-based performance evaluation. The areas to which such principles are applied have evolved over the years with the technological evolution in academia and industry.  
 ICPE contributions appear at all levels of system and software design, performance modeling, and measurements of performance, from the cloud’s core to edge, from mobile devices to major data centers, from web applications to scientific applications.  
 ICPE’s focus on performance engineering attracts both industrial practitioners and academics, united by their interest in quantifying the performance impact of various aspects of complex system design and implementation. Participants are also intellectually curious about design cycle lengths, lifetime maintenance issues, quality of experience, and the costs of delivering systems and services.

 Research Track  
 The research papers track is open to research contributions. Papers submitted in this track will be thoroughly reviewed for novelty, relevance, technical quality and scientific soundness by the members of the research track program committee. The track distinguishes two paper types:  
 Regular research paper with novel research contribution and extensive evaluation. These are simply the standard research papers that bring original research content in the usual structure. 
  Empirical / Experience / Reproduction / Case Study (EERCS) papers that place more emphasis on empirical evaluation, real life experience, reproduction or case study. In this group, papers should describe new experience with existing approaches or methodologies. Both positive and negative reproduction studies are welcome 
  The submission deadlines are listed on the important dates page  .  
 Submissions must be appropriately anonymized for the double blind submission process. Please see the Double Blind FAQ  for more details.  
 Submissions are made via HotCRP  and must be in the standard ACM format for conference proceedings. More specifically, the double column formats have to be used for all paper submissions: Latex preferred, Word. Papers must not exceed 10 pages, which includes figures and tables, but not references and appendices. The camera ready version of the accepted papers may use up to 2 extra pages to remove anonymization and address potential shepherding comments, but may not add significant non reviewed content.  
 To promote research reproducibility, the authors of the accepted research papers in this track are encouraged to submit an artifact to the conference Artifact Track  . After the artifact review, such papers will be awarded an artifact badge following the ACM Artifact Review and Badging  policy.  
 The conference Award Committee will recognize the best submissions, judged by multiple relevant factors, with an ACM/SPEC Best Paper Award  award.  
 Instructions for Authors from ACM  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 Program comprehension is a vital software engineering and maintenance activity. It is necessary to facilitate reuse, inspection, maintenance, reverse engineering, reengineering, migration, and extension of existing software systems. ICPC (formerly IWPC) provides an opportunity for researchers and industry practitioners to present and discuss both the state of the art and the state of the practice in the general area of program comprehension.

 Research Track  
 The research papers track is open to research contributions. Papers submitted in this track will be thoroughly reviewed for novelty, relevance, technical quality and scientific soundness by the members of the research track program committee. The track distinguishes two paper types:  
 Regular research paper with novel research contribution and extensive evaluation. These are simply the standard research papers that bring original research content in the usual structure. 
  Empirical / Experience / Reproduction / Case Study (EERCS) papers that place more emphasis on empirical evaluation, real life experience, reproduction or case study. In this group, papers should describe new experience with existing approaches or methodologies. Both positive and negative reproduction studies are welcome 
  The submission deadlines are listed on the important dates page  .  
 Submissions must be appropriately anonymized for the double blind submission process. Please see the Double Blind FAQ  for more details.  
 Submissions are made via HotCRP  and must be in the standard ACM format for conference proceedings. More specifically, the double column formats have to be used for all paper submissions: Latex preferred, Word. Papers must not exceed 10 pages, which includes figures and tables, but not references and appendices. The camera ready version of the accepted papers may use up to 2 extra pages to remove anonymization and address potential shepherding comments, but may not add significant non reviewed content.  
 To promote research reproducibility, the authors of the accepted research papers in this track are encouraged to submit an artifact to the conference Artifact Track  . After the artifact review, such papers will be awarded an artifact badge following the ACM Artifact Review and Badging  policy.  
 The conference Award Committee will recognize the best submissions, judged by multiple relevant factors, with an ACM/SPEC Best Paper Award  award.  
 Instructions for Authors from ACM  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 International Conference on Program Comprehension 2025  
   
 The 33rd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2025) is the premier venue for work in the area of program comprehension. It encompasses both human activities for comprehending the software and technologies for supporting such comprehension. ICPC 2025 promises to provide a quality forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present and to discuss state-of-the-art results and best practices in the field of program comprehension. ICPC 2025 is co-located with ICSE 2025  .  
 ICPC 2025 solicits four main categories of research contributions: research papers, early research achievement (ERA) papers, replications and negative results papers, and tool demos. On top of this, journal first papers from selected journals will be accepted for presentation. Research papers describe original work in the area of program comprehension; ERA papers report early research results with the main goal of fostering discussion at the conference. Replications and negative results papers concerned with the re-execution of existing research aimed at strengthening previous findings as well as the presentation of sound empirical methods leading to negative results. Finally, tool demonstrations report about new instruments making available and usable to practitioners’ program comprehension methods.

 Call for Research Papers  
  
 The International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM) is the premium forum for researchers, practitioners, and developers in process mining. The objective is to explore and exchange knowledge in this field through scientific talks, industry discussions, contests, technical tutorials, and panels. The conference covers all aspects of process mining research and practice, including theory, algorithmic challenges, applications, and connections with other fields.  
 The conference is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society and supported by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining.  
 Process mining is an innovative research field that focuses on extracting business process insights from transactional data commonly recorded by IT systems, with the ultimate goal of analyzing and improving organizational productivity along performance dimensions such as efficiency, quality, compliance, and risk. By relying on data rather than perceptions gained from interviews and workshops, process mining shifts the way of thinking from “confidence-based” to “evidence-based” business process management. Thus, process mining distinguishes itself within the information systems domain by its fundamental focus on understanding, analyzing, and improving business processes based on process data.  
 Current process mining challenges include scalability, i.e., dealing with volume, velocity, veracity, and variability of input data, especially in real-time/online settings using event streams; approximation, i.e., balancing computation time with accuracy; understandability and explainability, i.e., providing easy-to-understand and explainable analytics; multi-perspective analysis, i.e., considering data, resources and time beyond the process control flow; measurability, e.g., providing a comprehensive framework for measuring differences between observed and modelled process behavior, and ethical and confidential aspects of process mining, i.e., how to ensure that process mining procedures and results do not violate ethical and privacy principles.  
    
 Topics for Research Papers  
 ICPM 2024 encourages papers on new methodologies, techniques, and applications for process mining, as well as case studies coming from industrial scenarios. Also, papers describing novel tools, fundamental research, and empirical studies on process mining are expected. For the sake of replicability of the presented studies, the addition of supplementary resources is strongly encouraged, such as used datasets, publicly accessible implementations of new techniques, and experimental packages for empirical studies. The use of novel, previously unpublished datasets is most welcome. Research on existing datasets must clearly showcase the novelty or unprecedented results of the applied analysis.  
 Selected, accepted research papers will be considered for publication in an extended and revised form in a special issue of the flagship journal Process Science, edited by Springer ( https://link.springer.com/journal/44311  ).  
 The thematic areas in which contributions are sought include, but are not limited to, those listed below.

 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  
 The Process Mining community welcomes the advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) across our professional endeavors. We celebrate the diversity in our community and foster an environment that welcomes individuals irrespective of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, nationality, beliefs, sexual orientation, physical capabilities, education, and professional background. We urge all participants to uphold DEI principles in their written work, reviews, presentations, and any engagement linked to the ICPM conference.  
  
 Open Science Principles  
 The ICPM conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. In particular, the conference supports the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourages authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data in order to increase reproducibility and replicability.  
 Authors are encouraged to make research artefacts (e.g., prototypes, interview protocols, questionnaires) or the datasets (used in, or produced by, the empirical evaluation) reported in the paper available in a suitable form. To facilitate this, we kindly ask authors to include links in their manuscripts to private or public repositories where reviewers can access the associated research artefacts. This information may be presented in a dedicated section, such as “Data availability” or “Reproducibility”. This requirement does not apply to papers that neither involve an empirical study nor a prototype implementation.  
 Authors who are unable or choose not to share their research artefacts and datasets with the program committee are encouraged to provide an explanation within their submitted manuscript, detailing the reasons behind their decision. This statement may be removed from the final version of the paper if it gets accepted. Possible reasons may involve privacy restrictions or non-disclosure agreements. While sharing research artefacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, the program committee members may use this information to inform their decision.  
 To enhance the accessibility of research artefacts and datasets, authors are advised to make them accessible via public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, GitHub, or institutional archives) under an open data license such as the CC0 dedication or the CC-BY 4.0 license. Making research artefacts and datasets available via cloud services such as Dropbox or Google Docs is discouraged due to the volatility of the links associated with these services.  
 Finally, authors are encouraged to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open, preserved repositories, such as their institutional preprint repository, arXiv, or other non-profit services, in line with IEEE’s copyright agreement (see IEEE Preprint Policy  ).  
 Submission Instructions  
 Submissions must be original contributions that have not been published previously, nor submitted elsewhere while being submitted to ICPM 2024. All files must be prepared using the latest IEEE Computational Intelligence Society conference proceedings guidelines (8.5′′ × 11′′ two-column format). The page limit is set to 8 pages (IEEE Format). All papers must be in English. The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Templates are available for LaTeX and Word at the following link: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html  .  
 The paper should be submitted through the ICPM 2024 submission system, which is reachable at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpm2024  where one should select “ICPM 2024”.  
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least 3 program committee members. Afterwards, there will be a discussion period to finalize the decisions.  
 At least one author of each accepted contribution is expected to register for the conference to present the paper and sign a copyright release form.  
 Innovation Track  
 This year, ICPM 2024 features an Innovation Track to highlight novel research ideas and unconventional applications in Process Mining. Papers with strong potential to spark discussion at the conference but do not fully meet the criteria for the main conference will be invited for presentation at the innovation track. The authors will be asked to create a poster to present their research. The Innovation Track offers a platform for researchers and practitioners to present their work, engage with attendees, and receive feedback on ongoing projects.

Encompassing a spectrum from foundational theory to practical implementation, it spans systems of all scales—from small configurations to the largest infrastructures. PDP addresses fundamental computational challenges alongside robust applications and delves into architecture, compiler, language, interface design and deployment, tools, support infrastructures, and performance optimization.  
 Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing fields have evolved significantly, marked by the emergence of novel architectures and groundbreaking applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major application area, leveraging parallel and distributed technologies to enhance computational efficiency and enable sophisticated AI models. This progress emphasizes the dynamic fusion of parallel and distributed technologies with other rapidly advancing domains. In evaluating these cutting-edge developments, it is imperative to highlight the latest research achievements in established areas of parallel and distributed computing, drawing insights from  
  both industrial and academic perspectives.  
 The 2025 PDP Conference will offer a high-quality program featuring research papers, special sessions, and stimulating keynote speakers.  
  
  Proceedings of the conference will be published by Conference Publishing Services  and submitted for indexing in Scopus.

 The Industry Track  focuses on high quality submissions from industry that increase the collaboration between industry and academia through the sharing of production state-of-the-art, open problems, and novel applications of theory in practice.  
 Authors of performance-focused papers published in selected journals are invited to submit to the Journal First Track  and present their work at ICPE 2025.  
 The Emerging Research Track  offers the opportunity to present and discuss new ideas and vision papers on emerging research challenges. Also, preliminary results from the latest research may be presented, where some aspects of the work remain open, possibly with limited or no evaluation.  
 The Artifacts Track  hosts artifacts accompanying the accepted research track and industry track papers, but also independently submitted data and independently submitted tools.  
 The Data Challenge Track  invites participants to address the challenges presented by a performance dataset provided by the organizers.  
 The Poster and Demo Track  welcomes posters outlining work relevant to the performance engineering community, as well as technical demonstrations providing an opportunity to showcase an existing tool or a research prototype. Submissions can also be related to papers submitted to the other tracks.  
 The Tutorials Track  welcomes proposals for tutorials presented by leading scientists and practitioners in areas of relevance for the ICPE community.  
 The Workshops Track  welcomes proposals for workshops on specific aspects of performance engineering.  
 General Submission Information  
 Submissions to all tracks is yet to be determined and conform to the ACM proceedings format  . More specifically, the double column formats have to be used for all paper submissions.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register at the full rate, and at least one author (who may or may not be the same as the one who registered at the full rate) is required to be registered for the conference, attend the conference and present the paper. Presented papers will be published in the ICPE 2025 conference proceedings that will be published by ACM and included in the ACM Digital Library.

 Research Track  
 The research papers track is open to research contributions. Papers submitted in this track will be thoroughly reviewed for novelty, relevance, technical quality and scientific soundness by the members of the research track program committee. The track distinguishes two paper types:  
 Regular research paper with novel research contribution and extensive evaluation. These are simply the standard research papers that bring original research content in the usual structure. 
  Empirical / Experience / Reproduction / Case Study (EERCS) papers that place more emphasis on empirical evaluation, real life experience, reproduction or case study. In this group, papers should describe new experience with existing approaches or methodologies. Both positive and negative reproduction studies are welcome 
  The submission deadlines are listed on the important dates page  .  
 Submissions must be appropriately anonymized for the double blind submission process. Please see the Double Blind FAQ  for more details.  
 Submissions are made via HotCRP  and must be in the standard ACM format for conference proceedings. More specifically, the double column formats have to be used for all paper submissions: Latex preferred, Word. Papers must not exceed 10 pages, which includes figures and tables, but not references and appendices. The camera ready version of the accepted papers may use up to 2 extra pages to remove anonymization and address potential shepherding comments, but may not add significant non reviewed content.  
 To promote research reproducibility, the authors of the accepted research papers in this track are encouraged to submit an artifact to the conference Artifact Track  . After the artifact review, such papers will be awarded an artifact badge following the ACM Artifact Review and Badging  policy.  
 The conference Award Committee will recognize the best submissions, judged by multiple relevant factors, with an ACM/SPEC Best Paper Award  award.  
 Instructions for Authors from ACM  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 International Conference on Program Comprehension 2025  
   
 The 33rd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2025) is the premier venue for work in the area of program comprehension. It encompasses both human activities for comprehending the software and technologies for supporting such comprehension. ICPC 2025 promises to provide a quality forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present and to discuss state-of-the-art results and best practices in the field of program comprehension. ICPC 2025 is co-located with ICSE 2025  .  
 ICPC 2025 solicits four main categories of research contributions: research papers, early research achievement (ERA) papers, replications and negative results papers, and tool demos. On top of this, journal first papers from selected journals will be accepted for presentation. Research papers describe original work in the area of program comprehension; ERA papers report early research results with the main goal of fostering discussion at the conference. Replications and negative results papers concerned with the re-execution of existing research aimed at strengthening previous findings as well as the presentation of sound empirical methods leading to negative results. Finally, tool demonstrations report about new instruments making available and usable to practitioners’ program comprehension methods.

 Research Track  
 The research papers track is open to research contributions. Papers submitted in this track will be thoroughly reviewed for novelty, relevance, technical quality and scientific soundness by the members of the research track program committee. The track distinguishes two paper types:  
 Regular research paper with novel research contribution and extensive evaluation. These are simply the standard research papers that bring original research content in the usual structure. 
  Empirical / Experience / Reproduction / Case Study (EERCS) papers that place more emphasis on empirical evaluation, real life experience, reproduction or case study. In this group, papers should describe new experience with existing approaches or methodologies. Both positive and negative reproduction studies are welcome 
  The submission deadlines are listed on the important dates page  .  
 Submissions must be appropriately anonymized for the double blind submission process. Please see the Double Blind FAQ  for more details.  
 Submissions are made via HotCRP  and must be in the standard ACM format for conference proceedings. More specifically, the double column formats have to be used for all paper submissions: Latex preferred, Word. Papers must not exceed 10 pages, which includes figures and tables, but not references and appendices. The camera ready version of the accepted papers may use up to 2 extra pages to remove anonymization and address potential shepherding comments, but may not add significant non reviewed content.  
 To promote research reproducibility, the authors of the accepted research papers in this track are encouraged to submit an artifact to the conference Artifact Track  . After the artifact review, such papers will be awarded an artifact badge following the ACM Artifact Review and Badging  policy.  
 The conference Award Committee will recognize the best submissions, judged by multiple relevant factors, with an ACM/SPEC Best Paper Award  award.  
 Instructions for Authors from ACM  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 53rd International Conference on Parallel Processing  
 Gotland, Sweden - August 12-15, 2024  
   
 Registration   

  Call For Papers  
   
 ICPP, the International Conference on Parallel Processing, provides a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to present their latest research ﬁndings in all aspects of parallel and distributed computing. ICPP is one of the oldest computer science conferences; ICPP 2024 is the 53rd edition of ICPP.   
 ICPP2024 will be held in Gotland, Sweden, from  August 12 - 15, 2024  . ICPP 2024 is a premier venue for presenting the latest research on all aspects of parallel processing. Topics of interest in ICPP 2024 papers include, but are not limited to:   
 Algorithms: | Parallel and Distributed Algorithms, Parallel and Distributed Combinatorial & Numerical Methods, Scheduling Algorithms for Parallel and Distributed Applications and Platforms, Algorithmic Innovations for Parallel and Distributed Machine Learning, Post-Moore parallel algorithms. 
  Applications: | Applications: Parallel and Distributed Applications, Scalable Data Analytics & Applied Machine Learning, Computational and Data-Driven Science & Engineering (e.g., Astrophysics, Computational Chemistry, Bioinformatics, Climate Science, Finance, Geology). 
  Architecture: | Parallel Computer Architecture and Accelerator Designs, Large-Scale System Architectures, Datacenter/Warehouse Computing Architecture, Machine Learning Architectures, Micro-Architecture for Parallel Computing, Architectural Support for Networking, New Memory Technologies, Near-Memory Computing, Parallel I/O, Architectures for Edge Computing, Post-Moore, Architectural Support for Reliability and Security. 
  Multidisciplinary: | Multidisciplinary: Innovation combining multiple disciplines, Converged HPC Cloud Edge computing, Complex Workﬂows, Methodologies for Performance Portability and/or Productivity across Architectures.

  Software: | Software: System Software, Middleware, Runtimes for heterogeneous computing, Parallel and Distributed Programming Languages & Models, Programming Systems, Compilers, Libraries, Programming Infrastructures and Tools, Operating and Real-Time Systems. 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Paper submissions  should not exceed 10 pages (including references)  and all submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission portal (  https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/icpp   ) in PDF format printable on US letter size (8.5" x 11") paper. Please use the ACM format located at:  https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template   . More speciﬁcally, we recommend using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} conﬁguration for submissions prepared in LaTex. Changes to the template (e.g., margin, font size) could lead to automatic rejection. Up to two additional pages may be subsequently purchased (if needed) for the camera-ready version. Submissions should represent original research results and cannot already be under review or accepted for publication in another venue.   
 The review process is  double-blind  , so submissions should  not  reveal the identity of the authors. Authors should leave out author names, aﬃliations, and (any) acknowledgment from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the  third person  (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors with further questions about double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.   
 The ICPP 2024 technical program includes a  reproducibility initiative  , where the submitters will be given an option to submit details about the artifacts that enable their experiments to be reproduced. A reproducibility submission consists of the description of the computational artifacts (up to two pages appendix) and persistent and permanent links to the computational artifacts submission (  more information regarding the ICPP reproducibility initiative here   ). The submission of the reproducibility artifacts will be voluntary, but their presence will be an advantage during the decision process compared to submissions with equivalent ratings without artifacts.  
    
 All accepted papers that are presented at the conference will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will also need to follow the conference registration policy to be included in the conference proceedings. We will oﬀer rejected papers an opportunity to be forwarded to workshop organizers to be considered in one of the workshops if the authors choose to do so.   
 Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model   
 ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here  .  
 Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows:

 Important Deadlines (AOE)   
 Abstract Submission: April 8, 2024  April 22nd, 2024(Required) 
  Paper Submission: April 15, 2024  April 29th, 2024

  Submission Link   
 Please visit this link   to make paper submissions.   
 Please Note   
 At least one author of an accepted paper will attend the conference in person. 
  The expectation of attendance is implicit in submitting a paper to a conference, rather than a journal, and brings ethical responsibilities to participate actively in the conference (talking to other attendees, presenting the paper, and attending conference sessions). 
  It is expected that all accepted papers will be presented in person. 
  As an author of an accepted paper, this means you should exhaust all efforts for at least one of you to attend, including seeking a visa (where needed). 
  Any allowance for remote presentation will be considered only after clear evidence that attendance is impossible. 
  The conference proceedings will be finalized after the conference based on the papers presented. 
  A registration fee is required for all accepted papers, regardless of attendance. 
  Contact   
 If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the ICPP 2024 Program Committee Track Chairs for inquires about a specific track or Co-Chairs ( This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.  ) for Technical Program questions.

 About  
 The 15 th  International Conference on Pattern Recognition Systems (ICPRS) is an annual international event that follows ICPRS-24, ICPRS-23, ICPRS-22, ICPRS-21, ICPRS-19, ICPRS-18, ICPRS-17 and ICPRS-16, a continuation of the successful Chilean Conference on Pattern Recognition that reached its 6th edition in 2014. In 2025 it is organised by the University Adolfo Ibáñez (Viña del Mar, Chile)  and the Chilean Association for Pattern Recognition  (ACHiRP, a member of the IAPR), expected to be endorsed by the IAPR  and the IEEE Chile Section  . As per previous years, papers deemed to be of the required standard AND presented at the conference are expected to be published by the IEEE and indexed in IEEE Xplore. Please note that the publishers might reject papers which are too similar to previous publications, even if the work is presented at the conference. All papers need to be submitted via Conftool to be peer-reviewed (double-blind) by an international panel of experts.  
   
  The International Conference on Pattern Recognition Systems (ICPRS-25) aims to create an important networking forum in which participants can discuss the present and future of pattern recognition systems.  
   
  Its predecessors ICPRS-24, ICPRS-23, ICPRS-22, ICPRS-21, ICPRS-19, ICPRS-18, ICPRS-17, ICPRS-16, CWPR and CCPR, have traditionally been a meeting point of different disciplines (computer science, engineering, mathematics, machine learning, etc.) and an opportunity for a wide range of researchers and practitioners to discuss the many different aspects of the application of pattern recognition technologies.

As per previous years, papers deemed to be of the required standard AND presented at the conference, are expected to be published by the IEEE and indexed in IEEE Xplore (tbc). Please note that the publishers might reject papers which are too similar to previous publications, even if the work is presented at the conference. All paper submissions need to be submitted via Conftool to be peer-reviewed (double-blind) by an international panel of experts.  
 There will be a good set of keynote talks   
   
 We also welcome "Datasets Papers" that introduce a new public dataset and a baseline to encourage new lines of research.    
 This conference will be a 100% in-person event  .  
 There will be a special category of "Student Papers"  , where the first author must be a student (undergraduate or postgraduate). There will be a special prize for best student paper.   
 All paper submissions will be submitted on-line to be peer-reviewed by an international panel of experts  . Please note that all papers will be checked by a plagiarism detecting software so that papers that exceed a threshold of coincidence will not be passed on for reviews.  
 Also please note that reviews will be double-blind so please do not  include author names and affiliations in your paper (also do not cite your previous work as "in our previous paper [x]", etc.).  
   
 There is an A4 pdf version  of the conference call for papers as well as an A3 size version  and an A2 size version  , suitable for printing and displaying on announcement boards! :-)  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers describing novel and previously unpublished results on all aspects of Pattern Recognition Systems, from academia, industry, NGOs and others, to be selected for oral presentations or posters, on topics including, but not limited to:

  It is | strongly | recommended to use Latex (e.g. | Overleaf | ) 
  Papers must be written in English. 
  To submit a paper, please click | here. | If you have not yet done so, you will need to create an account (if you participated in a previous ICPRS you might already have an account). PLEASE NOTE that the special "Student Paper" category requires the first author to be a registered student at the time of submission, otherwise use the normal paper category. 
  Please note | that an accepted paper will only be sent to the publishers if at least one of its authors registers at a normal full author (not student) delegate fee 
  We are using the ConfTool System  .   

 Keynote Speakers  
   
 These will be announced later in the year   
  
 Workshops  
   
 To be announced later in the year. Programme  
 To be announced after paper acceptance.   

 Registration  
   
 All authors of accepted papers and all other attendees, will need to register through EventBrite* (tbc, the link will be provided after the acceptance notification date)  
 For an accepted paper to be presented and published, it needs to be associated to an "Author Full Fee"  registration ( and not  to a Student or an Other registration). If only a student author is attending the conference and presenting their paper, then they need to pay an "Author full fee" (and not  the student fee). We have to operate like this to cover conference and publishing costs. Also, if one of the authors registers as "Author Full Fee", additional authors of the same paper who also want to attend the conference only need to pay a lower fee e.g. as Student or Other, as appropriate to their status. Following IAPR policy, each author full fee registration will cover the presentation of up to three papers by the registered person who also needs to be a co-author of those papers  . Presentation of additional papers beyond those three, by the same conference delegate  will require the payment of an additional full author fee  . In all cases there are reductions for members of the sponsoring organisations.  
   
  The fee structure will be announced later in the year.  
   
 (*) please note that there is an extra charge by EventBrite of about 8%-10%    

 Accommodation  
   
 Details will be announced later in the year

  Frequently Asked Questions  
   
 I have a paper accepted but require an invitation to arrange my trip to London | Please contact the conference Local Chair (Dr Romina Torres)  so that she can arrange to send you an invitation letter. 
  Will the event will be online? | No. We expect this to be a full in-person event. We invite researchers worldwide to submit their novel articles. 
  Is there any facility for students to submit articles? | Students are encouraged to submit papers. If they are the first author they can be submitted as "Regular Student Paper" and would be considered for a special prize. The paper would still need to be associated to a registration as an Author Full Fee. For details about the registration fees, please check the Registration  section 
  Do I have to pay extra if I have more than one paper accepted? | Please refer to the Registration  section for the detailed fee conditions. 
  Will all accepted papers be indexed in Scopus and others? | As in previous versions of the conference, we expect that the papers will be indexed in Scopus, Xplore and others. Please note that only papers that are accepted AND presented AND associated to a delegate fee, will be sent to the publisher. It is very important that the papers are in the correct format and have been proof-read by a competent English speaker, as the publisher may reject poorly written papers or those that overlap significantly with previously published work. 
  Does a paper discussing the application of pattern recognition in the manufacturing industry (as a black-box, and not so much about which specific methods) fit your conference? | Yes! We welcome papers describing real-world applications of pattern recognition systems.

 Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Authors  

 Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to ICRA 2025. The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content. The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy.  

 Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Reviewers  

 Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under review shall not be processed through an AI system. Doing so is considered a breach of confidentiality and as such is not permitted.  

 Note for authors who require a CC BY open access license  

 Please note that some authors (such as those funded by UKRI) require a “Creative Commons Attribution Only License – Open Access” (CC BY) s license for their papers. If you require a CC BY license for your paper, please follow the guidelines described under option 2 on the following website: https://open.ieee.org/ieee-compliance-with-ukri/   

 FAQ  

 What is this year’s motto? Which topic areas are covered by the conference?   
          Traditionally, ICRA covers all areas of robotics research. In order to find out if your paper will fit to the conference, you may want to check the ICRA keywords. You can find the complete list of ICRA keywords here: Keywords – IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (ieee-ras.org)   
 When you submit a paper, you should select at least three keywords from this list.  

  Is the ICRA review process single-blind or double-blind?   
          The ICRA review process is single-blind (reviewers stay anonymous, but author information is visible). Therefore, manuscripts should include all authors and their affiliations. Additionally, please identify and include the email address of the corresponding author.  
 You can find templates here: Important Information for Manuscript Preparation (papercept.net)   

  Can I add supplementary material in the paper or as an attachment?   
          The allowed paper length is 6+N, meaning 6 pages for the paper content, plus any number of pages for the references. Any supplementary material must fit within the 6 regular pages. A video attachment is possible.  
 You can find more details on the paper format here: https://2025.ieee-icra.org/announcements/paper-submissions/   

  Will there be an extension to the paper submission deadline?   
          There is no plan to extend the paper submission deadline.   

  Can I add weblinks in the paper?   
          You can include URLs (not links embedded in the pdf), but you should not expect that reviewers will look at those links, or that they will influence the review process. Beyond the submitted paper and the (optional) supplementary video, reviewers are not required to look at any other material when writing their reviews.  
 Please find more information of the PDF requirements on Compliance (papercept.net)  .  

  Is it allowed to submit a paper that previously was published at a workshop or on a preprint server (e.g. arxiv)?   
          IEEE supports the evolutionary publication paradigm of workshop papers being improved to conference papers, which are then improved to journal papers. Therefore, papers, which previously have been published at a workshop without formal/peer reviewed proceedings, can be submitted to ICRA. Similarly, papers, which have been uploaded on a preprint server (e.g. arxiv) and are not submitted simultaneously to any other conference or journal, can be submitted to ICRA.  
 However, if your workshop paper has a DOI, this would be considered as an archival publication equivalent to a conference paper. Such papers cannot be submitted.  

  How can I transfer an accepted paper from T-ASE/T-FR/RA-P for presentation at ICRA?   
          If you want to transfer an accepted paper from one of the journals T-ASE, T-FR, or RA-P to ICRA, the paper should be submitted in paperplaza in the relevant submission category of ICRA. Do not submit it as a regular ICRA paper! For the paper upload, you will need to enter a code, which can be obtained from the Editor-In-Chief of the journal.  
 Notice that papers from T-RO, RA-M, and RA-L follow a different process and do not require a code. Authors of accepted papers will receive an email from PaperCept regarding the transfer of their paper to a conference at which they wish to present their paper.

 Best Industry Related Paper Award  
 Home     » Awards     » ICPR Awards     » Best Industry Related Paper Award       

 The Best Industry Related Paper Award will be awarded at each ICPR. The paper will be selected by a committee appointed by the Chair of the Industry Liaison Committee.  
   
  The award is given to a paper selected for oral presentation at ICPR, where at least one of the authors is from a company or technology transfer organization.  
   
  The award is officially announced at the conference dinner. However, there is traditionally a Best Industry Related Paper Award session during the conference some time before the dinner, where the nominees discuss the relation between academic and industrial research. The BIRPA award winner is unofficially announced at this session.  
 Award Procedure   
 The ICPR paper submission system needs to allow authors to self-nominate for the award, where one author must be from a company or a technology transfer organization. Purely university author lists are not eligible. The Program Chair is responsible for ensuring the submission system allows self-nomination. 
  Once paper acceptances are announced and the 'camera-ready' versions of the papers are submitted, the ILC Chair asks the Program Chair for the list of and PDFs of the highly ranked self-nominated oral papers, along with the reviews for those papers. 
  Each ILC member gets (3*num_papers/committee_size) revised papers to read, along with the original reviews. The ILC member does not need to write anything, but is asked to rank the papers in order of best to worst. There is a 3 week deadline. The papers are 6 pages long, so this should take maybe 5 hours. 
  From the ranked papers, the ILC chair selects the top 5(ish) based on the preliminary rankings. The whole ILC reads these and ranks them again. There is a 3 week deadline. 
  From these final rankings, a consensus ordering is formed. The ILC Chair keeps the committee informed about the process. 
  The Chair passes the selected winner's details to the IAPR's Secretary and the IAPR office. 
  The Chair and ICPR Program Chair schedule a 1 hour award session, where the nominees will be asked to give a 5 minute presentation on the relation of research and industry. There will be a panel discussion afterwards, and then finally the announcement of the BIRPA prize. The presentation and panel discussion is not a factor in the award decision.
