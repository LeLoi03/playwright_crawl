 IEEE Symposium on CI in Security, Defence and Biometrics (IEEE CISDB)  
   
 Symposium Chair: Rajesh Murthy  - rmurthy[at]gapask.com

  Scope  
 Cyberattacks have come a long way since the first worm, CREEPER, was released on the ARPANET followed by the first defence, REAPER. In recent years, Ubiquitous cyberattacks have become more sophisticated with advanced persistent threats (APT), polymorphic viruses, ransomware, phishing schemes, zero-day attacks and other sinister worms. Enterprises are always playing catch-up. Meanwhile, governments across the world have woken up to critical re-thinking of what the cyber world is from a perspective of not only its usefulness but also the threats and limitations it brings. A host of security directives, regulations, and strategies have been created to enhance data and critical infrastructure protection mechanisms to not only become secure and resilient but also improve privacy and trust.  
 This symposium aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of Computational Intelligence (CI) models and applications in the realms of security and resilience. Delving into the past, present, and future, the symposium will address challenges, advancements, and emerging trends to foster collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and industry experts.  
 We are seeking contributions that address either theoretical developments or practical applications in this field. Further, the symposium aims to promote collaboration and the sharing of knowledge to develop the field of CI in Security, Defence and Biometrics.

 IEEE AND IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY POLICIES   
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications Society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more:  
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism   
  IEEE Policy on Double Submission   
 IMPORTANT: To be published in the IEEE CCNC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the FULL or LIMITED (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented online by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified to both present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one FULL or LIMITED registration is valid for up to 3 papers.  
 The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  
 During the initial paper submission process via EDAS, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on the EDAS registration page. In particular, the EDAS registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper CANNOT be changed in the final manuscript.  
 To ensure appropriate consideration of conflicts of interest during the review process, ComSoc prohibits changes to the list of authors once a paper has been submitted for review during review, revision, or (if accepted) final publication. The author list may be changed only prior to the submission deadline.

  The 2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI 2023) is a flagship annual meeting of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. It will be held in the largest Spanish-speaking city, Mexico City. IEEE SSCI 2023 will co-locate 43 exciting symposiums, each dedicated to a special topic within or related to computational intelligence, thereby providing a unique platform for promoting cross-fertilization and collaboration

  Cooperative Metaheuristics (IEEE SCM)  
  Differential Evolution (IEEE SDE)  
  Swarm Intelligence Symposium (IEEE SIS)  
  Call for Special Sessions  
  IEEE SSCI 2023 is made up of symposiums. There are areas in computational intelligence that may not be covered by these symposiums or interdisciplinary areas with a narrow focus that sits at the interface of two or more of these symposiums. These areas are better suited for a special session. For example, two of the symposiums at IEEE SSCI are the IEEE Symposium on Immune Computation and the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Cyber Security. It is feasible to see a special session proposal that sits at the interface of these two such as a special session on Immune Systems for Network Intrusion Detection.  
  Special session proposals should include title, a description of the scope, a list of topics covered, a list of potential contributors, and names, affiliations, websites, and bios of special session organizers. It is expected that at least one of the organizers of a special session would be attending IEEE SSCI 2023.  
  A special session will only run if there are at least six accepted papers. If the number of accepted papers is less, the papers will be allocated to the most relevant symposium.

 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March  
  IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.

 IEEE Symposium on CI in Security, Defence and Biometrics (IEEE CISDB)  
   
 Symposium Chair: Rajesh Murthy  - rmurthy[at]gapask.com  
 Technical Activities Liaison/Strategy: Berk Canberk   
 Symposium Technical Chair: Suresh Sundaram   
 Symposium Publicity Chair: Renato Sant Anna   
 Symposium Industry Chair: Simon See   
 Symposium Publication Chair: Kanishka Tyagi   

  Scope  
 Cyberattacks have come a long way since the first worm, CREEPER, was released on the ARPANET followed by the first defence, REAPER. In recent years, Ubiquitous cyberattacks have become more sophisticated with advanced persistent threats (APT), polymorphic viruses, ransomware, phishing schemes, zero-day attacks and other sinister worms. Enterprises are always playing catch-up. Meanwhile, governments across the world have woken up to critical re-thinking of what the cyber world is from a perspective of not only its usefulness but also the threats and limitations it brings. A host of security directives, regulations, and strategies have been created to enhance data and critical infrastructure protection mechanisms to not only become secure and resilient but also improve privacy and trust.  
 This symposium aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of Computational Intelligence (CI) models and applications in the realms of security and resilience. Delving into the past, present, and future, the symposium will address challenges, advancements, and emerging trends to foster collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and industry experts.  
 We are seeking contributions that address either theoretical developments or practical applications in this field. Further, the symposium aims to promote collaboration and the sharing of knowledge to develop the field of CI in Security, Defence and Biometrics.  
 Topics  of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 CI for Technologies:  

 Cyber Security  
 Malware prediction 
  Malware classification 
  Malware responce 
  Survivable self-aware system models 
  Survivable resilient system models

  Swarm Intelligence Symposium (IEEE SIS)  
  Call for Special Sessions  
  IEEE SSCI 2023 is made up of symposiums. There are areas in computational intelligence that may not be covered by these symposiums or interdisciplinary areas with a narrow focus that sits at the interface of two or more of these symposiums. These areas are better suited for a special session. For example, two of the symposiums at IEEE SSCI are the IEEE Symposium on Immune Computation and the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Cyber Security. It is feasible to see a special session proposal that sits at the interface of these two such as a special session on Immune Systems for Network Intrusion Detection.  
  Special session proposals should include title, a description of the scope, a list of topics covered, a list of potential contributors, and names, affiliations, websites, and bios of special session organizers. It is expected that at least one of the organizers of a special session would be attending IEEE SSCI 2023.  
  A special session will only run if there are at least six accepted papers. If the number of accepted papers is less, the papers will be allocated to the most relevant symposium.

 Artificial Intelligence    

  IEEE SSCI is an established flagship annual international series of symposia on computational intelligence sponsored by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. The 2022 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI) will be held in Singapore, from December 4th to December 7th, 2022. IEEE SSCI 2022 promotes and stimulates discussion on the latest theory, algorithms, applications and emerging topics on computational intelligence. The IEEE SSCI co-locates multiple symposia under one roof, each dedicated to a specific topic in the CI domain, thereby encouraging cross-fertilization of ideas and providing a unique platform for top researchers, professionals, and students from all around the world to discuss and present their findings. IEEE SSCI 2022 will feature keynote addresses, tutorials, panel discussions and special sessions, all of which are open to all participants. The conference proceedings of the IEEE SSCI will be included in the IEEE Xplore and indexed by all major databases.  
  IEEE is committed to the principle that all persons shall have equal access to programs, facilities, services, and employment without regard to personal characteristics not related to ability, performance, or qualifications as determined by IEEE policy and/or applicable laws

  Call for Special Sessions  
  IEEE SSCI 2022 is made up of symposiums. There are areas in computational intelligence that may not be covered by these symposiums or interdisciplinary areas with a narrow focus that sits at the interface of two or more of these symposiums. These areas are better suited for a special session. For example, two of the symposiums at IEEE SSCI are the IEEE Symposium on Immune Computation and the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Cyber Security. It is feasible to see a special session proposal that sits at the interface of these two such as a special session on Immune Systems for Network Intrusion Detection.  
  Special session proposals should include title, a description of the scope, a list of topics covered, a list of potential contributors, and names, affiliations, websites, and bios of special session organizers. It is expected that at least one of the organizers of a special session would be attending IEEE SSCI 2022.  
  A special session will only run if there are at least six accepted papers. If the number of accepted papers is less, the papers will be allocated to the most relevant symposium.

 Introduction  
   
 IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions.  
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants - from fast food to Michelin star - and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Applied Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, industry events, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions. For additional information, please visit the conference website at ieee-ssci.org.

 Introduction  
   
 IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions.  
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

 IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia:  
 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Energy, Transport and Environmental Sustainability (IEEE CIETES) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Engineering / Cyber Physical Systems (IEEE CIES) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Image, Signal Processing and Synthetic Media (IEEE CISM)

  2025 IEEE Symposia for Multidisciplinary Computational Intelligence Incubators (IEEE MCII) 
   
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings IEEE SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non-skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants - from fast food to Michelin star - and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Applied Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, industry events, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions. For additional information, please visit the conference website at ieee-ssci.org.  
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of IEEE SSCI and the 2025 event.  
 We welcome both computational intelligence researchers and domain experts to make submissions. The following types of submissions are allowed:  
 Full papers: | complete papers describing your novel research in full, for publication in the symposia proceedings. 
  Short papers: | papers with novel insights, approaches or ideas which may not have been fully tested yet, for publication in the symposia companion proceedings. 
  Late breaking papers: | extended abstracts with a "prequel" to provoke novel conversations for future work or ideas to emerge, or with a "sequel" to a prior research contribution, or with a discussion to alert the community of important topics that may not yet have received sufficient attention, or with an original discussion or critique of existing methodologies. These are for poster presentation at the conference but not to be included in the proceedings. Authors of accepted late breaking papers will be given the option to have their papers linked from the SSCI page under a section corresponding to the symposium if they upload their paper to a preprint repository (e.g., ArXiv). 
  Abstract (poster-only) submission: | abstracts for poster presentation at the conference but not to be included in the proceedings. These may involve, e.g., novel insights, or new ideas which may not have been fully tested yet, or presentation of challenges posed by a given domain that could benefit from computational intelligence. 
  Journal to conference (J2C): | submissions of papers accepted at IEEE Transactions journals sponsored by CIS and first appeared in IEEEXplore within the past 2 years, for presentation at the conference but not to be included in the conference proceedings. 
  For more instructions on each kind of submission including page limitations and submission format, please see submission instructions.

 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE SERVICES ENGINEERING  
  SSE 2025  

 Software as a service (SaaS) – a framework for encapsulating and delivering applications as services has been a very popular architecture of choice for many business applications. Instead of installing and maintaining software, services are accessed on the cloud, avoiding complex and costly software and hardware management. The framework has been a great success primarily due to how it allows for cost-effective modular service requirements decomposition and modular service composition during the development, operation, maintenance, and evolution of the encapsulated software and the underlying computing platform.  
 But despite the successes and unparalleled popularity, next-generation software services are increasingly pressured to become more than just encapsulated code with a service interface. Demands abound for such services to be context and situation-aware, driven by behaviour observed and captured from both the environment and humans, intrinsically modifying their service delivery behaviour accordingly. They are also expected to be self-aware and autonomous, sentient of their own offerings and intelligent enough to reason about other opportunities that can be afforded by teaming and bonding with other self-aware services. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), services are further required to be ultra-mobile, ultra-fine-grained, ultra-trustworthy, and ultra-intelligent, capable of learning from their own data as well as their peers. Such IoT services must survive the presence of unavoidable uncertainties from the data, the analytics, and the environment, and must cope with unpredictable ambiguities brought about by end-user interactions.  
 Moreover, human-centric concerns in service design are expanding beyond the traditional focus to include developers, operators and end-users, alike, in the end-to-end process of developing, deploying, managing and evolving such services as the underlying technologies change and evolve.  
 Next generation software services are therefore anticipated to be the superheroes that, in addition to encapsulating service code, do somehow apply state-of-the-art techniques that cut across the areas of service computing, machine learning, software engineering, pervasive computing, IoT, dependable computing, psychophysiological or brain science, autonomics, among others, to support the emerging cutting-edge applications of the future. Recognizing the need for a disruptive approach to enabling next generation software services, the IEEE World Congress on Services has taken a first step by dedicating a special symposium organised by academic and industrial leaders from the software engineering and services computing communities to chart a way forward. The International Symposium on Advances in Software Services Engineering which was held in 2021 and 2022, has concluded with a set of recommendations, which is a cross-cutting declaration and a manifesto of a new field of study named Software Service Engineering (SSE), based on the prevalent body of knowledge and professional practices of software engineering methods and tools, as well as advances in the other disciplines as described above. Based on these recommendations, the International Conference on Software Services Engineering (SSE) was established as a replacement of the Congress’ previous Conference on Service Computing (IEEE SCC). It was inaugurated in 2023 in Chicago, USA, to further establish this field and to organise the participation and contributions of its constituent R&D communities.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The IEEE Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T)  has established itself as a major venue for development and exchange of ideas in modern software engineering education. Over the years, the conference has become the center of a vibrant and innovative community of educators - both academics and industry professionals.  
 In 2025, the 37th edition of CSEE&T will be co-located with ICSE 2025  - the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering - in Ottawa, Canada. CSEE&T 2025 will replace ICSE’s traditional education track (SEET)  , allowing for a greater focus on software engineering education through a dedicated co-located conference. By joining forces with ICSE, we aim to bring together the two communities best placed to address the many challenges of educating the next generation of software engineers.  
 CSEE&T 2025 aims to solicit, review, and publish original high-quality contributions addressing challenges, innovations, and best practices in software engineering education and training. All types of software engineering education are of interest, including (but not limited to) primary and secondary education, university education at undergraduate and graduate levels, coding clubs, hackathons, bootcamps, industrial training, informal study, and life-long learning.

  Evaluations of teaching and assessment methods in software engineering 
  Empirical studies describing software engineering education contexts 
  Pedagogical approaches supporting software engineering education and training in distributed and remote settings 
  Learning technologies and tools that support software engineering education and training 
  Developing soft skills (communication, collaboration, teamwork, organization, negotiation, conflict management) for software engineers 
  Studies of equity, diversity, and inclusion in software engineering education and training 
  Ethical and societal concerns (e.g., sustainability, human values) in software engineering education and training 
  Onboarding and on-the-job training of software engineers 
  Continuing education of software engineers 
  Extra-curricular training of software engineering students (e.g., through hackathons, bootcamps) 
  Certification and training for professional software engineers 
  Use of online platforms and resources for software engineering education 
  Role of culture and gender in software engineering education and training

  Submission Categories   
 Research Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 A research paper must address a topic related to software engineering education using appropriate research techniques and proper scholarly writing. Negative and mixed findings are welcome.  
 Experience Report  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An experience report provides anecdotal evidence by describing an experience related to software engineering education and training (typically a course, a teaching or training technique or strategy, or an assessment method) and interprets the experience in terms of actionable advice and lessons learned, but does not need to evaluate it or use rigorous research methods to support its claims. Negative and mixed findings are welcome, provided they can support advice or lessons learned.  
 Industry Paper  (max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references)  
 An industry paper is a research paper or an experience report (as described above) that covers the topic of software engineering education and training in industry. In this category, students are industry practitioners who learn about software engineering in an industry setting.  
 Idea Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 An idea paper must present a new software engineering education and training idea with a proposed formal evaluation strategy, possibly with some preliminary or informal results.  
 Tool Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A tool paper describes a tool or technology built or customized by the authors that supports software engineering education and training. Papers in this category should discuss the impact of the tool on the learning process. A tool paper can optionally be accompanied by a short video (not exceeding five minutes) demonstrating the tool’s main functionality (if you use this option, please provide the link at the end of the abstract). Tools must be available online so they can be evaluated (also possible on a trial basis) and be mature enough.  
 Replication Paper  (max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references)  
 A replication paper describes the repetition of an existing and already published pedagogical intervention (e.g. course, approach, study) in new contexts. The goal is to determine whether the basic findings related to the original pedagogical intervention can be applied to other circumstances.  
 Journal-first Submission  (max 1 page)  
 A journal-first submission relates to a software engineering education and training paper already peer-reviewed and published in a journal. The authors will be invited to present their work at CSEE&T. They must submit a one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, its authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper on the journal’s web site.  
 Submissions should not exceed their respective category page limit, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices. The page limits are strict and non-compliance will result in a desk-rejection.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 Submissions will be evaluated based on their category:  
 Research Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Verifiability, Presentation 
  Experience Reports  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Actionability, Lessons, Presentation 
  Industry Papers  will be evaluated like Research Papers  when presenting research results and like Experience Reports  when reporting on experiences 
  Idea Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Tool Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Presentation 
  Replication Papers  will be evaluated against these criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Presentation 
  Journal-first Submissions  will be evaluated based on their own category, as described above. 
  The evaluation criteria are defined as follows:  
 Relevance | : The extent to which the paper is relevant to CSEE&T. 
  Significance | : The extent to which the paper is well-motivated and its contributions are original and important, with respect to the existing literature on software engineering education and training. 
  Soundness | : The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods and whether the paper discusses meaningfully the research methods’ limitations and threats to the validity of the findings. 
  Verifiability | : The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. This includes public availability of research data. In cases where this is not possible, an explicit statement covering why such data cannot be made publicly available is mandatory. 
  Actionability | : The extent to which the paper provides actionable advice with clear take-away messages. 
  Lessons | : The extent to which the paper meaningfully discusses lessons learned in terms of what went right, what went wrong, and what could be improved if the experience is repeated. 
  Presentation | : The extent to which the paper’s organization and quality of writing meets the standard: the paper is well-structured, employs clear and correct scholarly language, avoids ambiguity, includes clearly readable figures and tables, and is formatted according to the template specifications. 
  How to Submit   
 All submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the | IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines | (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use | \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} | without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to CSEE&T 2025, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the | ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | and the | IEEE Plagiarism FAQ | . In particular, papers submitted to CSEE&T 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and | must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for CSEE&T 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM and IEEE have been involved in ORCID from the start and we have made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  CSEE&T 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities in the paper nor in the artifacts, code, videos, tools, documentation, or repositories associated with the submission. The authors must make every effort to honor the | double-anonymous review process | . In particular: | Authors’ names | must be omitted from the submission. 
  All | references | to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to CSEE&T 2025. 
  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | ICSE 2025 Q&A | . 
  By submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the IEEE | , | submission policy of the IEEE | , and the | authorship policy of the ACM | (and associated | FAQ | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions to CSEE&T 2025 that meet the above requirements can be made via the submission site   by the submission deadline. Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected without further review  .  
 We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that the formatting guidelines, double anonymous guidelines, and any other submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission.  
 Open Science Policy   
 CSEE&T 2025 aims to follow the ICSE 2025 Open Science policies. In summary, the steering principle is that research results should be made accessible to the public and empirical studies should be reproducible whenever possible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability whenever allowable and applicable.  
 We are aware that some datasets and tools may not be made open and public (e.g., when prohibited by a Non-Disclosure Agreement, when the Ethics Review Board forbids sharing data for participant privacy, when tool source code is commercial-in-confidence, etc.). We also recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and credibility of research results, see the ICSE 2025 Open Science page. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, non-sharing needs to be justified.  
 IMPORTANT  : We therefore ask all authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability  after the Conclusion  section. Authors can also provide anonymized links to anonymized data and repositories in that section or can upload anonymized data using the supplementary material upload option during submission process via the HotCRP submission site  . Authors who cannot disclose data should provide a short statement explaining the reasons why they cannot share the data in the Data Availability section of their paper, after the Conclusion section.  
 Authors are asked to carefully review any supplementary material to ensure it conforms to the double-anonymous policy employed for ICSE 2025. For example, code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site to support review.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

  Call for Special Sessions  
  IEEE SSCI 2022 is made up of symposiums. There are areas in computational intelligence that may not be covered by these symposiums or interdisciplinary areas with a narrow focus that sits at the interface of two or more of these symposiums. These areas are better suited for a special session. For example, two of the symposiums at IEEE SSCI are the IEEE Symposium on Immune Computation and the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Cyber Security. It is feasible to see a special session proposal that sits at the interface of these two such as a special session on Immune Systems for Network Intrusion Detection.  
  Special session proposals should include title, a description of the scope, a list of topics covered, a list of potential contributors, and names, affiliations, websites, and bios of special session organizers. It is expected that at least one of the organizers of a special session would be attending IEEE SSCI 2022.  
  A special session will only run if there are at least six accepted papers. If the number of accepted papers is less, the papers will be allocated to the most relevant symposium.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

  ICSE 2025  ( series  ) /  Journal-first Papers ICSE 2025   
   
 Call for Contributions  
  
 ICSE has formed partnerships with prestigious software engineering journals to incorporate journal-first papers into the ICSE program. Through this initiative, authors of journal-first papers accepted in the partnering journals will be invited to present their work at ICSE, thus providing an opportunity for the authors to engage directly with the community and offering the ICSE attendees an additional dimension to the research track program.  
 The journals that support the journal-first model as partners with ICSE are:  
 IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE), 
  ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM), 
  Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). 
  Scope   
 A submission to the ICSE 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria:  
 The associated journal paper needs to have been accepted to a journal from the above list no earlier than November 1st, 2023 and no later than October 10th, 2024. 
  The paper is in the scope of the conference. 
  The paper does not exclusively report a secondary study, e.g., systematic reviews, mapping studies, surveys. 
  The paper reports completely new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work. | The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
  As a rough guide, a journal-first paper should have at least 70% new content over and above the content of previous publications. As such, the expectation is that an extension of a full 8-10 pages conference or workshop paper would not be deemed a journal-first paper. 
  The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
  How to Submit   
 The authors of any paper that meets the above criteria are invited to submit a (maximum) one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Web site. If the journal paper is related to or builds on a previously published work (such as a tool demo or a poster), then the proposal must clearly and explicitly justify why the paper should be considered a journal first paper.  
 The template to use is the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). It is important to note that these submissions will not  be published. The specified format is so that all the submissions have a consistent look to facilitate the selection process.  
 By submitting your article to an IEEE Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all IEEE Publications Policies.  
 Submission site: https://icse2025-jf.hotcrp.com/   
 Submissions must not exceed 1 page.  
 Evaluation and Selection   
 Authors will be invited to present their paper at ICSE 2025 after a check that the paper satisfies the above listed criteria. As the papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. In the case that an exceptionally high number of submissions is received, not all papers will be selected. Priority will be given to the papers that:  
 Increase opportunities for authors to attend ICSE, who might not otherwise attend. In particular, priority will be given to papers whose specified presenter is not presenting other journal first or main research track papers. 
  Best fit the technical program, offering a balance across the conference topics: preference will be given to topics that are under-represented in the other tracks. 
  Would be ineligible as a journal-first presentation at the next SE3 conference (ICSE/FSE/ASE) – because its acceptance date precedes the next conference’s window of journal acceptance dates for JF presentations. 
  If there is further need to select from papers with the same priority, then they will be randomly selected. However, we will do our best to avoid this situation.  
 Important Dates   
 Journal First Submissions Deadline: 21 October 2024 
  Journal First Acceptance Notification: 10 December, 2024 
  Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12) 
  Conference Attendance Expectation   
 If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, the specified presenter must register for and attend the full 3-day technical conference and present the paper. The presentation is expected to be delivered in person, unless this is impossible due to travel limitations (related to, e.g., health, visa, or COVID-19 prevention). Each journal-first presentation will be scheduled in a session with topically-related Technical Track, NIER, SEIP, and/or SEIS papers. The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the ICSE proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program.

 Gen. Paul M. Nakasone  
 Former Commander, U.S. Cyber Command & Former Director  
 A name synonymous with visionary leadership, retired four-star Army General Paul M. Nakasone is the longest-serving leader of the U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency/Central Security Service, and is regarded among an elite class of leaders whose strategic expertise at the nexus of cybersecurity, technology, and geopolitics has laid the groundwork for upholding our nation’s security in the modern age. General Nakasone’s career spans more than three decades of pivotal moments in modern warfare and digital defense and he draws upon his experiences constantly at the epicenter of conflict to share battle-tested lessons on transformational leadership, while also examining the challenges and opportunities organizations face in the ever-evolving tech and security landscape. Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, Nakasone is an engaging and dynamic speaker who leads audiences on a fascinating exploration into how our experiences today, paired with the advent of rapid and constant technological change, will shape the future — and what that means for how we approach the safety and security of our systems and society. Pointing to strategies that consistently led him and his teams to mission success in his own career, Nakasone shares recent examples of complex situations in which innovative ideas provided the catalyst for successful outcomes. As part of his talks, Nakasone emphasizes the skills that need to be sharpened in order to make a transformational impact as a leader, as well as the importance of purposefully recruiting, training, and retaining talent. He is of the belief that, ultimately, what shapes our future is fully dependent on the manner in which organizations invest leadership and talent. From the crucible of the Pentagon on 9/11 and spearheading the response to the most significant intrusion into the Defense Department’s classified networks, to the Wars in Iraq in Afghanistan, Nakasone has served as one of the most influential problem-solvers at the center of cyber and information operations and dedicated his career to being a steadfast guardian of our national security interests. He was also part of the select group of leaders that conceptualized and built U.S. Cyber Command from the ground up, and subsequently led their most elite forces before rising to command the entire organization, as well as the NSA/Central Security Service. In addition to his standing as a career Army officer who climbed the ranks to lead elite units battling the world’s top cyber hackers, Nakasone is widely recognized as an agent of innovation who championed new approaches to solving multifaceted challenges in rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats. His persistent approach to cyber defense against nation-state hackers has redefined the national and global security playbooks, while his emphasis on partnerships fostered a collaborative ecosystem transcending international, interagency, and private sector agencies. Under his stewardship, transparency became a cornerstone for his teams, elevating the confidence and trust of the American people in the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command. He retired as Commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Director of the NSA, and Chief of the Central Security Service on February 1, 2024 — having served in those roles since May 2018. General Nakasone’s remarkable service has been recognized with innumerable awards and decorations. Among them are the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and Defense Meritorious Service Medal — to name a few. Described as “a transformational leader who strengthened our national security, bolstered our deterrence, and defended our democracy,” Nakasone remains a vocal advocate for defending the nation and securing the best possible future through people and partnerships.

She emphasizes that making even small changes in this field requires continuous reflection on what can be improved through technological advancements and tireless communication. She finds it particularly meaningful to encourage more healthcare workers, especially in resource-limited and change-resistant environments, to participate in the digital transformation journey. By sharing her personal experiences and impactful hospital stories with various audiences both within and outside the hospital, she aims to inspire others to join this essential movement towards improving healthcare through IT. Consequently, she played a pivotal role as an intermediary, facilitating communication and participation among various departments for the hospital to achieve Stage 7 in the four areas of maturity model (INFRAM, EMRAM,DIAM and AMAM).

 Regular paper track  

 The Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) 2025 will take place May 7-9, 2025, in Konstanz, Germany.  
  
 Advancing Intelligent Data Analysis requires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as an exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore, IDA accepts inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. The IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion. In addition, IDA awards the Frontier Prize every year, recognizing the most visionary contributions.  
  
 Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process; author identities are known to reviewers. The conventional reviewing process favors incremental advances on established work and can discourage the kinds of papers that IDA 2025 aims to publish. The reviewing process will address this issue explicitly: referees will evaluate papers based on novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. Furthermore, each submission will be reviewed by one of the senior program committee (SPC) members. Any paper for which an SPC makes a convincing argument about how it addresses the symposium’s goals will be accepted independent of the overall review score.  
 All accepted paper contributions will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series  by Springer-Verlag.  

 Formatting instructions  
 Contributions written in English must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag. These guidelines, along with templates, are available here: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  .  
  
 We strongly recommend using the LNCS template for LaTeX. The page limit for any contribution, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices, is 10 to 12 pages in LNCS format. Submission of the camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors’ consent to publish on the above Springer LNCS website.  
  
 Authors may not submit any paper that is under review elsewhere or that has been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of IDA 2025. The authors, their contact information, or affiliations may not be changed after the paper submission deadline. If the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must register for the conference and present the paper in person in Konstanz.  

 Submission  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. The submission interface is available here:   
 Microsoft CMT – Regular Track Submission   
  
 Abstract submission deadline: November 22, 2024 
  Paper submission deadline: November 29, 2024 
  Notification of acceptance: January 31, 2025 
  You have to submit your abstract and title by November 22 and the corresponding full papers by November 29. All dates are specified as 23:59 SST (Standard Samoa Time / Anywhere on Earth)  
 Call for paper as a text file   
  
 FAQ  
 Does IDA have a ‘double-blind’ peer-reviewing policy?   
 No, IDA uses standard single-blind peer-reviewing, meaning that reviewers are unknown to the authors, but authors are known to the reviewers. This implies that authors should not hide their identity in the paper.  
 What should I do if my paper is longer than the page limit?   
 Shorten it; submissions that deviate from the guidelines may be rejected without consideration. The length of the contribution, including figures, title pages, references and appendices, must be between 10-12 pages for the Proceedings Track.  
 Will there be a separate call for the PhD forum?   
 Yes, you will find the Call for PhD forum here  .  
 I am PhD student and would like to submit a full paper. To which track should I submit?   
 You should submit your paper to the regular paper track. The PhD forum offers PhD student to give a short presentation about their work and collect feedback, but it does not provide full-paper publications.  
 Can I post my submitted paper on ArXiv.org?   
 Yes, posting your submitted paper on a self-archiving website is allowed.

 HIMSS and Informa Markets Shape the Future of Healthcare Conferences in First Year of Partnership (08/14/2024)  

 August 14, 2024 

 One year after partnering to expand the annual HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) and Informa Markets are building on the success of HIMSS24 to redefine the healthcare conference experience while paving the way for long-lasting community growth and engagement with healthcare providers, technology professionals and the many contributors across the global health eco-system.  
 The landmark partnership between HIMSS, a global advisor to the health eco-system, and Informa, the world’s leading exhibition organizer, united Informa’s scale, expertise and resources with HIMSS’s unparalleled thought leadership. In year two of the partnership, the organizations are working closely to make HIMSS25 the most “must attend” conference in HIMSS history.  
 Recognized as the most influential health and healthcare event of the year, the HIMSS Global Health Conference and Exhibition brings together the global health community in discovery, shared insights, education and innovation. As one of the largest healthcare events in the world, it draws tens of thousands of healthcare leaders and professionals, technology innovators, HIMSS members, providers, and governmental organizations from around the globe.  

 “Our partnership with Informa has been fantastic, exceeding our expectations in the first year,” said HIMSS President & CEO Hal Wolf. “Informa has impressive expertise in conference production, and together we are making the HIMSS Global Conference experience inspirational and informative for all attendees.”   
 HIMSS will soon unveil its investment in improving and updating the HIMSS Membership Program  , and the Society’s leading digital transformation expertise. HIMSS maturity models create a global benchmark and certification process for every part of a health system’s digital health transformation, including analytics ( AMAM  ) and AI readiness, electronic medical records ( EMRAM  ), infrastructure ( INFRAM  ), and community care ( C-COMM  ). HIMSS Analytics provides the world’s healthcare systems with expert guidance and strategies to improve patient outcomes, protect data, reduce costs, and better develop and support their workforce.  
 Through dynamic and dedicated collaboration, HIMSS and Informa brought together nearly 30,000 healthcare professionals from more than 70 countries at HIMSS24 in Orlando to explore key topics, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, robotics, interoperability, and public policy. Nearly 500 speakers presented educational sessions selected through a highly competitive peer review process, and more than 1,000 exhibitors showcased the latest advancements in healthcare technology, services and devices on the expo floor.  
 At HIMSS25, hosted in Las Vegas March 3 – 6, HIMSS and Informa Markets will build off the success of the 2024 conference with elevated experiences, new networking opportunities with like-minded professionals, a world-renowned roster of expert speakers, and an exhibition hall delivering cutting-edge digital healthcare solutions.  
 HIMSS will continue to deliver expert certification for HIMSS Members, educational programming, and thought leadership that showcases the latest advancements and innovations in health information and technology. Informa Markets will provide unrivaled expertise in delivering world-class event experiences, a cutting-edge exhibition floor, executive-level thought leadership and attendee engagement.  
 A few of the planned improvements for HIMSS25 include an expanded program to connect entrepreneurs with investors, expanded access and offerings for HIMSS Members, and new health equity and smart health forums.  
 Registration for HIMSS25 opens on September 5, 2024.

General Nakasone’s career spans more than three decades of pivotal moments in modern warfare and digital defense and he draws upon his experiences constantly at the epicenter of conflict to share battle-tested lessons on transformational leadership, while also examining the challenges and opportunities organizations face in the ever-evolving tech and security landscape. Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, Nakasone is an engaging and dynamic speaker who leads audiences on a fascinating exploration into how our experiences today, paired with the advent of rapid and constant technological change, will shape the future — and what that means for how we approach the safety and security of our systems and society.

As part of his talks, Nakasone emphasizes the skills that need to be sharpened in order to make a transformational impact as a leader, as well as the importance of purposefully recruiting, training, and retaining talent.

In addition to his standing as a career Army officer who climbed the ranks to lead elite units battling the world’s top cyber hackers, Nakasone is widely recognized as an agent of innovation who championed new approaches to solving multifaceted challenges in rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats. His persistent approach to cyber defense against nation-state hackers has redefined the national and global security playbooks, while his emphasis on partnerships fostered a collaborative ecosystem transcending international, interagency, and private sector agencies.

 A name synonymous with visionary leadership, retired four-star Army General Paul M. Nakasone is the longest-serving leader of the U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency/Central Security Service, and is regarded among an elite class of leaders whose strategic expertise at the nexus of cybersecurity, technology, and geopolitics has laid the groundwork for upholding our nation’s security in the modern age. General Nakasone’s career spans more than three decades of pivotal moments in modern warfare and digital defense and he draws upon his experiences constantly at the epicenter of conflict to share battle-tested lessons on transformational leadership, while also examining the challenges and opportunities organizations face in the ever-evolving tech and security landscape. Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, Nakasone is an engaging and dynamic speaker who leads audiences on a fascinating exploration into how our experiences today, paired with the advent of rapid and constant technological change, will shape the future — and what that means for how we approach the safety and security of our systems and society. Pointing to strategies that consistently led him and his teams to mission success in his own career, Nakasone shares recent examples of complex situations in which innovative ideas provided the catalyst for successful outcomes. As part of his talks, Nakasone emphasizes the skills that need to be sharpened in order to make a transformational impact as a leader, as well as the importance of purposefully recruiting, training, and retaining talent. He is of the belief that, ultimately, what shapes our future is fully dependent on the manner in which organizations invest leadership and talent. From the crucible of the Pentagon on 9/11 and spearheading the response to the most significant intrusion into the Defense Department’s classified networks, to the Wars in Iraq in Afghanistan, Nakasone has served as one of the most influential problem-solvers at the center of cyber and information operations and dedicated his career to being a steadfast guardian of our national security interests. He was also part of the select group of leaders that conceptualized and built U.S. Cyber Command from the ground up, and subsequently led their most elite forces before rising to command the entire organization, as well as the NSA/Central Security Service. In addition to his standing as a career Army officer who climbed the ranks to lead elite units battling the world’s top cyber hackers, Nakasone is widely recognized as an agent of innovation who championed new approaches to solving multifaceted challenges in rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats. His persistent approach to cyber defense against nation-state hackers has redefined the national and global security playbooks, while his emphasis on partnerships fostered a collaborative ecosystem transcending international, interagency, and private sector agencies. Under his stewardship, transparency became a cornerstone for his teams, elevating the confidence and trust of the American people in the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command. He retired as Commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Director of the NSA, and Chief of the Central Security Service on February 1, 2024 — having served in those roles since May 2018. General Nakasone’s remarkable service has been recognized with innumerable awards and decorations. Among them are the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and Defense Meritorious Service Medal — to name a few. Described as “a transformational leader who strengthened our national security, bolstered our deterrence, and defended our democracy,” Nakasone remains a vocal advocate for defending the nation and securing the best possible future through people and partnerships.

 Dr. Meong Hi Son  
 Chief Medical Information Officer  
  Samsung Medical Center  
 Meong Hi son is an Associate Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine and currently holds the role of Chief Medical Information Officer at Samsung Medical Center, South Korea. Trained as a pediatrician specializing in pediatric hemato-oncology and pediatric emergency medicine, and despite having no initial background in IT, she has become a pioneering force in the digital transformation of healthcare services as a junior faculty member at Samsung Medical Center. During her early clinical career as a clinical fellow, Dr. Son spearheaded the migration of pediatric cancer treatment protocols and monitoring sheets from paper-based systems to electronic medical records (EMR). Not only did she initiate this critical transition, but she also played a key role in the actual implementation of EMRs, which became the driving force behind her involvement in the hospital’s digital transformation efforts.  Dr. Son believes that healthcare services involve complex processes managed by a diverse group of professionals. She emphasizes that making even small changes in this field requires continuous reflection on what can be improved through technological advancements and tireless communication. She finds it particularly meaningful to encourage more healthcare workers, especially in resource-limited and change-resistant environments, to participate in the digital transformation journey. By sharing her personal experiences and impactful hospital stories with various audiences both within and outside the hospital, she aims to inspire others to join this essential movement towards improving healthcare through IT. Consequently, she played a pivotal role as an intermediary, facilitating communication and participation among various departments for the hospital to achieve Stage 7 in the four areas of maturity model (INFRAM, EMRAM,DIAM and AMAM).

 Regular paper track  

 The Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) 2025 will take place May 7-9, 2025, in Konstanz, Germany.  
  
 Advancing Intelligent Data Analysis requires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as an exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore, IDA accepts inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. The IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion. In addition, IDA awards the Frontier Prize every year, recognizing the most visionary contributions.  
  
 Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process; author identities are known to reviewers. The conventional reviewing process favors incremental advances on established work and can discourage the kinds of papers that IDA 2025 aims to publish. The reviewing process will address this issue explicitly: referees will evaluate papers based on novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. Furthermore, each submission will be reviewed by one of the senior program committee (SPC) members. Any paper for which an SPC makes a convincing argument about how it addresses the symposium’s goals will be accepted independent of the overall review score.  
 All accepted paper contributions will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series  by Springer-Verlag.  

 Formatting instructions  
 Contributions written in English must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag. These guidelines, along with templates, are available here: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  .  
  
 We strongly recommend using the LNCS template for LaTeX. The page limit for any contribution, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices, is 10 to 12 pages in LNCS format. Submission of the camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors’ consent to publish on the above Springer LNCS website.  
  
 Authors may not submit any paper that is under review elsewhere or that has been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of IDA 2025. The authors, their contact information, or affiliations may not be changed after the paper submission deadline. If the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must register for the conference and present the paper in person in Konstanz.

 Does IDA have a ‘double-blind’ peer-reviewing policy?

 Gen. Paul M. Nakasone  
 Former Commander, U.S. Cyber Command & Former Director  
 A name synonymous with visionary leadership, retired four-star Army General Paul M. Nakasone is the longest-serving leader of the U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency/Central Security Service, and is regarded among an elite class of leaders whose strategic expertise at the nexus of cybersecurity, technology, and geopolitics has laid the groundwork for upholding our nation’s security in the modern age. General Nakasone’s career spans more than three decades of pivotal moments in modern warfare and digital defense and he draws upon his experiences constantly at the epicenter of conflict to share battle-tested lessons on transformational leadership, while also examining the challenges and opportunities organizations face in the ever-evolving tech and security landscape. Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, Nakasone is an engaging and dynamic speaker who leads audiences on a fascinating exploration into how our experiences today, paired with the advent of rapid and constant technological change, will shape the future — and what that means for how we approach the safety and security of our systems and society. Pointing to strategies that consistently led him and his teams to mission success in his own career, Nakasone shares recent examples of complex situations in which innovative ideas provided the catalyst for successful outcomes. As part of his talks, Nakasone emphasizes the skills that need to be sharpened in order to make a transformational impact as a leader, as well as the importance of purposefully recruiting, training, and retaining talent. He is of the belief that, ultimately, what shapes our future is fully dependent on the manner in which organizations invest leadership and talent. From the crucible of the Pentagon on 9/11 and spearheading the response to the most significant intrusion into the Defense Department’s classified networks, to the Wars in Iraq in Afghanistan, Nakasone has served as one of the most influential problem-solvers at the center of cyber and information operations and dedicated his career to being a steadfast guardian of our national security interests. He was also part of the select group of leaders that conceptualized and built U.S. Cyber Command from the ground up, and subsequently led their most elite forces before rising to command the entire organization, as well as the NSA/Central Security Service. In addition to his standing as a career Army officer who climbed the ranks to lead elite units battling the world’s top cyber hackers, Nakasone is widely recognized as an agent of innovation who championed new approaches to solving multifaceted challenges in rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats. His persistent approach to cyber defense against nation-state hackers has redefined the national and global security playbooks, while his emphasis on partnerships fostered a collaborative ecosystem transcending international, interagency, and private sector agencies. Under his stewardship, transparency became a cornerstone for his teams, elevating the confidence and trust of the American people in the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command. He retired as Commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Director of the NSA, and Chief of the Central Security Service on February 1, 2024 — having served in those roles since May 2018. General Nakasone’s remarkable service has been recognized with innumerable awards and decorations. Among them are the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and Defense Meritorious Service Medal — to name a few. Described as “a transformational leader who strengthened our national security, bolstered our deterrence, and defended our democracy,” Nakasone remains a vocal advocate for defending the nation and securing the best possible future through people and partnerships.

 December 2024    
 Are we alone? It is a compelling question that human beings have confronted for centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of quests for finding the simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe. The plausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life will followed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificial intelligence ... [Show full abstract]  (AI). In this work, we categorize the advanced civilizations (on an equal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. We propose a new scale known as space exploration distance to measure civilization advancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale. Then, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial black holes as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested by calculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose an observational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI using Dyson spheres-like structures around primordial black holes in the Milky Way and other galaxies.

[Show full abstract]  vision, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) place a spotlight on the interconnection of poverty eradication (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), and fostering innovation and infrastructure development (SDG 9). The United Nations recognizes the profound challenges posed by global food insecurity, malnutrition, and the increasing vulnerability of the food system to environmental changes. As populations grow and the demand for food surges, there is an imperative to innovate and transform our agricultural and food systems. Adopting advanced technologies, like precision agriculture, remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics, offers a promising avenue to address these challenges. Yet, despite the profound implications of these technologies in transforming agriculture, there remains a notable need for comprehensive research in this domain. Enhancing agricultural productivity, reducing resource wastage, and championing sustainability are pressing concerns. This study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of recent investigations centered on intelligent systems in agriculture, sourcing data from the Scopus database. To comprehensively analyze this vast dataset, a combined quantitative and qualitative approach is adopted, which is based on the visualization of similarities (VOS) method. We then map prominent areas of interest, evaluate international collaboration extents, and identify potential research gaps. Our findings offer pivotal insights that can shape the trajectory of future research and development in the agricultural sector. The significance of our analysis extends beyond academic interest. The insights derived hold the potential to catalyze the growth of smart systems in agriculture, addressing global food security challenges in the process. Moreover, by championing sustainable agricultural practices via intelligent systems, our study underscores its alignment with SDGs, notably those aiming at ensuring zero hunger and promoting responsible consumption and production.

 Superalloys, particularly nickel alloys such as Inconel 625, are increasingly used in biomedical engineering for manufacturing critical components such as implants and surgical instruments due to their exceptional mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. However, traditional machining methods often struggle with these materials due to their high strength and thermal conductivity. This ... [Show full abstract]  study investigates the application of Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) as an advanced method for processing Inconel 625 in biomedical contexts. The authors develop an Adaptive Neuro‐Fuzzy Inference System for forecasting WEDM parameters using grey‐based data. The model's variable inputs are analysed through analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Taguchi design, aiming to optimise process performance attributes relevant to biomedical applications. Comparative studies between predicted and experimental data demonstrate a high degree of accuracy, indicating that the proposed model effectively enhances the machining process. The results suggest that this intelligent system supports decision‐making in the production of high‐quality biomedical devices and components.

[Show full abstract]  agro-industrial enterprises. Intelligent Systems Based on Use artificial intelligence, machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data are opening up new opportunities for monitoring and managing agricultural processes. The article presents the results of a study aimed at the development of intelligent systems that provide comprehensive monitoring of the state of fields and management of production processes at agricultural enterprises. The proposed system integrates data from various sources, such as sensors, drones, satellite images and other IoT devices, which allows you to create a detailed and up-to-date view of the state of crops, soils and climatic conditions. This, in turn, allows you to make prompt and sound management decisions that increase the productivity and efficiency of agricultural production. Particular attention is paid to the development of algorithms for processing big data and machine learning methods, which are used to analyze the data obtained and generate recommendations for optimizing the use of resources. This includes managing water resources, fertilizers, crop protection products, as well as predicting yields and identifying potential threats such as plant diseases or pests. The implementation of such systems allows not only to reduce resource costs, but also to minimize the environmental impact of agriculture by reducing the use of chemicals and water. Thus, the article makes a significant contribution to the development of intelligent technologies in agriculture, offering new approaches to the management and monitoring of agricultural enterprises. These approaches can form the basis for the development of future innovations in this area, contributing to improving the resilience and efficiency of agro-industrial production in response to modern challenges.

 Transfer-based attacks, a type of adversarial attack, have become a growing threat in recent years with the proliferation of cloud services. Deep neural networks that exploit human cognitive bias (Loosely Symmetric-Deep Neural Network, LS-DNN) are known as a defensive technique against transfer-based attacks. LS-DNN can prevent malfunctions caused by adversarial examples with a high probability by incorporating human learning characteristics into the neural network’s nodes. However, maintaining accuracy against normal data and reducing Training Time is challenging. This paper proposes a new model called “LS[Formula: see text]-DNN” inspired by the Dropout method to solve this problem. Evaluation experiments on two datasets show that the proposed model can achieve both in high dimensions. In addition, we analyze the proposed model focusing on the variance and confidence score of the training parameters of the proposed model. As a result, we point out that the confidence score is an important indicator of robust models against transfer-based attacks.

 Various population-based optimization methods have been proposed following the development of evolutionary computation. Optimization is achieved through the interactions of many individuals in these systems. However, reliability becomes an issue when the system is implemented in a distributed environment. It may not be possible to trust others in such an environment. Many factors, such as malfunction of distributed parts or failure to synchronize, will break the trust. Therefore, there must be some mechanism that can build trust between distributed individuals. The record of past actions is usually a good source for trust building. This paper utilizes the blockchain mechanism for the population-based optimization system to make a trust management system. By using blockchain, we can implement trust without a central authority. In the system, all interactions are reviewed and get feedback, and the feedback is used to calculate the trust score.KeywordsTrusted systemBlockchainSurrogate Assisted Evolutionary Computation

 In multi-agent reinforcement learning, the problems of non-stationarity of the environment and scalability have long been recognized. As a first step toward solving these problems, this paper proposes a learning model, the BRT Algorithm with Q-Learning (hereafter, QBRT), based on the Bias and Rising Threshold (hereafter, BRT) algorithm, which can solve best-of-n problems where the number of options n is greater than 2 (hereafter, best-of-n problems (n >> 2)). This model is characterized by the fact that all of the agents that make up the herd agree in advance on what action the herd will take next. We thought that the problem of non-stationarity could be ameliorated to some extent by having all agents follow the same policy. On the other hand, the time it takes for agents to reach an agreement with each other generally tends to increase as the number of agents increases. In contrast, if BRT is used as a base, the time required for agreement could be kept almost constant even if the number of agents increases.We will validate the problem with an experiment using Tower of Hanoi by Multiagent (hereafter THM), a best-of-n problem (n >> 2) based on the classic puzzle “Tower of Hanoi”, which is a flock coordination problem.KeywordsMulti-agentReinforcement learningBest-of-n problemTower of Hanoi

 In recent years, with the proliferation of cloud services, the threat of Transfer-based attacks, a type of Adversarial attacks, has increased. Adversarial Training is known as an effective defense against this attack, but it has been pointed out that it degrades accuracy against normal data and robustness against random noise(Gaussian noise). To solve these problems, we focus on the human visual function, which has robustness while maintaining high accuracy. The contribution of top-down processing, in which the feedforward signal is overwritten by some bias factor, has been pointed out as the reason for this. From this perspective, we propose a new model based on Neural Networks using human cognitive bias. This is an algorithm that overwrites signals according to human cognitive bias and is expected to reproduce human visual functions. Evaluation experiments on two different datasets suggest that the proposed model is robust against Transfer-based attacks. Furthermore, the proposed model can mitigate the accuracy degradation of the normal data to a limited extent, suggesting that it is robust against random noise.KeywordsAdversarial attacksAdversarial examplesTransfer-based attacksRandom noiseCognitive biasNeural networksRobustness

 The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a unicellular and multinuclear giant amoeba with computational abilities. The plasmodium has been widely used as a model organism in the field of bio-computing; however, its ability to perform computation related to its biological nature itself in the essential sense has not yet been fully realized. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the phenomenon in which a plasmodium trapped in a closed space surrounded by repellent substances escapes from the field by changing its own behavior rules. We demonstrated that this phenomenon is bio-computationally important in that it may enable the implementation of biological characteristics in computing.

   Hiroshi Sato    
 Whether to keep effective management of supply chain even in the disasters has become a crucial issue for the manufacturing industry because modern supply chain networks spread global and complex, and the behaviors of the network are hardly predictable. The Beer Game is a simple but beneficial supply chain network model. The game consists of four sectors: factory, distributor, wholesaler, and retailer. The game’s goal is to deliver the beer to the customers in just proportion. Many business schools adopt it to learn the critical point of the supply chain. In this study, evolving computer agents by genetic algorithm play the game instead of humans. We examine how the agents handle the game significantly when some parts of the supply chain are disrupted for some reason. Through simulations, we confirmed that effective ordering strategies are different between sectors, and the positions of the sectors are an essential factor in their strategies.

 This paper proposes a scalable method of guiding sheep herding with efficiency and robustness by single or multiple sheepdogs. Recently, much attention has been paid to control methods modeled on a sheep herd by a very small number of sheepdog agents. Usually, these control systems are connected to the Internet in some way, and the system must be capable of dealing with requirements such as robot failure or hacking by malicious entities. However, except for a few studies, multiple sheepdog agents to work together efficiently have been rarely discussed. The main problem is the way to produce an efficient geographical role assignment to multiple sheepdogs. Experimental results show that the introducing repulsion gain K  f  4     K_{f4}      between a couple of two sheepdogs can emerge circle formation, while the group of sheepdogs guides a flock of sheep to goal. Therefore, it can achieve the task more quickly and reliably than the conventional method of a single sheepdog by increasing the number of units. This paper is based on the paper presented at the proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Swarm Behavior and Bio-Inspired Robotics (Tashiro et al., The 4th International Symposium on 528 Swarm Behavior and Bio-Inspired Robotics: 397–408, 2021).

 The highly synchronized parade can impress audiences how strong the troops seem to be, whereas it is difficult to train for the good parade because of its complex collective behavior. However, there is no scientific research about the important factor to train and produce a good parade is. One of the bottlenecks to the scientific approach is the difficulty of measurement of the quality of a group as same as other swarm researches. In this paper, we measured the posture data of members in the parade with OpenPose, which is a cutting-edge pose estimation technology of deep learning. By this measurement, we propose a numerical evaluation for the quality of the parade, and it is confirmed by the questionnaire. In conclusion, our evaluation method is applicable for the quantitative evaluation, and it was suggested that the variation level of the arm swing angles was related to the quality of the parade. This paper is based on the paper presented at the proceedings of the 3rd International Symposium on Swarm Behavior and Bio-Inspired Robotics [1].

 Military personnel have greater psychological stress and are at higher suicide attempt risk compared with the general population. High mental stress may cause suicidal ideations which are crucially driving suicide attempts. However, traditional statistical methods could only find a moderate degree of correlation between psychological stress and suicidal ideation in non-psychiatric individuals. This paper utilizes machine learning techniques including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting regression tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron to predict the presence of suicidal ideation by six important psychological stress domains of the military males and females. The accuracies of all the six machine learning methods are over 98%. Among them, the multilayer perceptron and support vector machine provide the best predictions of suicide ideation approximately to 100%. As compared with the BSRS-5 score ≥ 7, a conventional criterion, for the presence of suicidal ideation ≥ 1, the proposed algorithms can improve the performances of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, the AUC of ROC curve and the AUC of PR curve up to 5.7%, 35.9%, 4.6%, 65.2%, 4.3% and 53.2%, respectively; and for the presence of more severely intense suicidal ideation ≥ 2, the improvements are 6.1%, 26.2%, 5.8%, 83.5%, 2.8% and 64.7%, respectively.

Indeed, although artificial intelligence cannot currently replace healthcare professionals, its implementation may be complementary to classic clinical practice in order to improve the quality of care for patients [99]. Finally, since there appear to be artificial intelligence-based tools that may diagnose insomnia disorder and predict its involvement in the occurrence of SI in the general population [100] [101]  [102], it might be interesting to develop tools specific to apneic individuals in order to be able to compare the results obtained with these tools to those of our study. This approach could allow a confirmation of our results with a different method and would confirm the complementarity of conventional clinical approaches and artificial intelligence-based tools. ...

 Regular paper track  

 The Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) 2025 will take place May 7-9, 2025, in Konstanz, Germany.  
  
 Advancing Intelligent Data Analysis requires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as an exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore, IDA accepts inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. The IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion. In addition, IDA awards the Frontier Prize every year, recognizing the most visionary contributions.  
  
 Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process; author identities are known to reviewers. The conventional reviewing process favors incremental advances on established work and can discourage the kinds of papers that IDA 2025 aims to publish. The reviewing process will address this issue explicitly: referees will evaluate papers based on novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. Furthermore, each submission will be reviewed by one of the senior program committee (SPC) members. Any paper for which an SPC makes a convincing argument about how it addresses the symposium’s goals will be accepted independent of the overall review score.  
 All accepted paper contributions will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series  by Springer-Verlag.  

 Formatting instructions  
 Contributions written in English must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag. These guidelines, along with templates, are available here: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  .  
  
 We strongly recommend using the LNCS template for LaTeX. The page limit for any contribution, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices, is 10 to 12 pages in LNCS format. Submission of the camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors’ consent to publish on the above Springer LNCS website.  
  
 Authors may not submit any paper that is under review elsewhere or that has been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of IDA 2025. The authors, their contact information, or affiliations may not be changed after the paper submission deadline. If the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must register for the conference and present the paper in person in Konstanz.  

 Submission  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. The submission interface is available here:   
 Microsoft CMT – Regular Track Submission   
  
 Abstract submission deadline: November 22, 2024 
  Paper submission deadline: November 29, 2024 
  Notification of acceptance: January 31, 2025 
  You have to submit your abstract and title by November 22 and the corresponding full papers by November 29. All dates are specified as 23:59 SST (Standard Samoa Time / Anywhere on Earth)  
 Call for paper as a text file   
  
 FAQ  
 Does IDA have a ‘double-blind’ peer-reviewing policy?   
 No, IDA uses standard single-blind peer-reviewing, meaning that reviewers are unknown to the authors, but authors are known to the reviewers. This implies that authors should not hide their identity in the paper.  
 What should I do if my paper is longer than the page limit?   
 Shorten it; submissions that deviate from the guidelines may be rejected without consideration. The length of the contribution, including figures, title pages, references and appendices, must be between 10-12 pages for the Proceedings Track.  
 Will there be a separate call for the PhD forum?   
 Yes, you will find the Call for PhD forum here  .  
 I am PhD student and would like to submit a full paper. To which track should I submit?   
 You should submit your paper to the regular paper track. The PhD forum offers PhD student to give a short presentation about their work and collect feedback, but it does not provide full-paper publications.  
 Can I post my submitted paper on ArXiv.org?   
 Yes, posting your submitted paper on a self-archiving website is allowed.

 The Organizing Committee of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium 2025 (IV2025) solicits proposals for full and half-day workshops to be held on Sunday, 22 June 2025  . This day of workshops will precede the main conference, which takes place from Monday, June 23 through Wednesday, June 25.   
 We solicit workshop proposals that address important and new topics related to the conference: basic research and applications of leading advances in the fields related to Intelligent Transportation Systems.   
 IMPORTANT: Before submitting a proposal, verify if the topic overlaps totally or partially with the technical activities of IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS)  https://ieee-itss.org/technical-activities/       
 In this case, please contact the relevant technical committee to avoid overlap with topics already covered by the committee as part of their activities. Organizers of workshops that closely resemble existing offerings will be asked to collaborate with those existing efforts.    
  If the topic is new, please ignore the previous step and submit your proposal. You are welcome to initiate a new technical activity as well.    
 Workshops should focus on areas of active research, in order to provide an informal forum for participants to exchange developing research results and ideas.   
 Workshop organizers will be asked to chair the sessions and to organize the review process of the papers submitted (if any) and the invited talks (if any). The papers submitted to workshops will follow the same review process as the papers submitted to the main IV conferences and in case of acceptance will be published in the conference IEEE Xplore proceedings.

  - 
  Historically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale.  
 The FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software.  
 Originally a workshop event, since 2018 FormaliSE has been organized as a conference co-located with ICSE. The 13th edition of FormaliSE will also take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025.  
 Area of interest include:  
 requirements formalization and formal specification; 
  approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation; 
  formal approaches to safety and security related issues; 
  analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches; 
  scalability of formal method applications 
  integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change -management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment) 
  model-based engineering approaches; 
  correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering; 
  application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems; 
  formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM); 
  formal methods in a certification context 
  case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches 
  experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems; 
  guidelines to use formal methods in practice; 
  usability of formal methods. 
    
 Call for Papers  
  
 We accept papers in three categories:  
 Full research papers | describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development. 
  Case study papers | discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability). 
  Research ideas papers | describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work. 
  All papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below).  
 Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references. Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references.  
 To avoid that authors waste time fitting their papers into the stated limit at the expense of presentation clarity, paper lengths slightly exceeding the stated limit will still be considered, provided that the reviewers find that the presentation is of high quality.  
 All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template  , specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}  without including the compsoc  or compsocconf  options. Note that IEEE format is being used this year, whereas last year it was ACM format, hence the appearance will differ from year to year.  
 To submit a paper to FormaliSE 2025 use the following HotCRP link  .  
 Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process for Papers   
 As in recent editions, FormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is reducing chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities. The double-anonymous process is, however, lightweight, which means that it should not pose a heavy burden for authors, nor should make a paper’s presentation weaker or more difficult to review. Also, advertising the paper as part of your usual research activities (for example, on your personal web-page, in a pre-print archive, by email, in talks or discussions with colleagues) is permitted without penalties.  
 PAPER SELECTION   
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity.  
 FormaliSE 2025 will adopt a lightweight response process: if all the reviewers of a given paper agree that a clarification from the authors regarding a specific question could move the paper from “borderline” to “accept”, the chairs will relay the reviewers’ questions to the authors by email, and then share their reply with the reviewers in HotCRP. The goal of lightweight responses is reducing the chance of random decisions on borderline papers. Hence, they will only be used for a minority of submissions; most papers will not require such an author response. Nevertheless, we would ask the corresponding authors of all submissions to make sure that they are available to answer questions by email upon request.  
 PUBLICATION   
 All accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings.
