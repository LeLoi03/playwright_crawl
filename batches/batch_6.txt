 The Global Event for Chips to Systems   

 I AM DAC  
   
 Exploring My Future at DAC  
 As a student passionate about electronic design and the semiconductor industry, I attend DAC to get a head start on my career. I am able to demonstrate my skills to design professionals and connect with mentors, recruiters, and future colleagues worldwide. I know that DAC can jumpstart careers by providing unparalleled networking and recruitment opportunities.  

 Research & Academia at DAC  
 My research drives innovation in the field and I'm here to showcase my work. DAC is the premier global design automation event, it assembles the ecosystem's foremost leaders, enabling us to spotlight breakthroughs pushing boundaries in the field. Presenting my research at DAC puts my work on the map, not just in the US but globally. DAC is not just about where we are today, it's about where the world will be tomorrow and far into the future.  

 Industry and Collaboration at DAC  
 As a design engineer in the electronic design ecosystem, I attend DAC to find the latest solutions and methodologies in AI, EDA, chip verification, design, and more. The technical program provides education for me and my colleagues, while the exhibits allow for firsthand interaction with vendors. The event is the perfect place to gain knowledge and network over four days. The DAC conference draws over 5,000 attendees that allows me to meet and collaborate with other designers in the ecosystem.  

 Exhibiting at DAC  
 As an exhibitor at DAC, I showcase my organization's software solutions and/or services to enable the next generation of chip design. More importantly, DAC gives us face to face time with our valuable customers and high-potential prospects from across the globe. It's the only yearly event that supports our business development objectives and my organization's goals.

 About ICIN Conference    
 Since 1989, the ICIN conferences have been bringing together leading internet and telecom experts from industry, academia, and government from across the globe. ICIN is a single-track conference that is both intimate and global, attracting 100+ delegates, from more than 20 countries. It focuses on leading-edge investigations into Internet technologies from basic networking and cloud services to novel architectures. ICIN uses a rigorous peer-review process and has become an established industry forum to discuss emerging trends in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). It offers an agora for one on one discussions and cross-fertilization between participants and leading network visionaries with the goal of promoting dialogue and ideation about the current and future trends in networking research and development. ICIN conferences are well known for their identification of research challenges and industry trends and their discussion on the impact of cutting-edge technologies on future intelligent and distributed networking and related computing services. ICIN has an enviable track record of identifying key technology and service – and analyzing their impact on business models – before they become widely recognized in the industry and government communication sectors. The interdisciplinary approach and the cross-fertilization of ideas are the main ingredients that made ICIN a recognized event in the cloud networking and Internet communities.  
 ICIN now a recognized event in its domain and successive venues have been as follows:

  Design   
 DAC has served as a meeting place for designers of electronics from chips to systems for over five decades. Increasingly, the challenges faced by the industry require co-optimization of design, methodologies and tools that can only be achieved using cross-domain interaction of researchers and practitioners. DAC serves this need by covering design as a topic area in the research and engineering tracks.  
 The design topics covered in the research track include the design of cyber-physical, System-on-Chip (SoC) and multi-die architectures, accelerator-based computing, emerging models of computation such as brain-inspired and quantum computing, digital and analog circuits, and emerging device technologies.  
 Separately the Engineering Track allows tool users to share challenges and benefits of different tools, flows, and methodologies for IP, front-end, back-end as well as systems and software design, and provides excellent opportunities for education and networking between end users and tool developers. There is no other way to improve your “design IQ” in such a short amount of time than to attend the Engineering Track..  
 Industries include:   
  Aerospace and Defense   
  Automotive   
  Consumer   
  Data Center   
  Industrial   
   
 Key topics include:   
  Security   
  Low Power   
  Chiplet   
  Cloud

 Wed, 17 Jul 2024 17:16   DATE 2025 - Call for Papers    
 The DATE conference is the main European event bringing together designers and design automation users, researchers and vendors as well as specialists in the hardware and software design, test and manufacturing of electronic circuits and systems. DATE puts a strong emphasis on both technology and systems, covering ICs/SoCs, reconfigurable hardware and embedded systems as well as embedded software.  
 The three-day event consists of a conference with regular papers, late breaking results papers and extended abstracts, complemented by timely keynotes, special days, focus sessions, embedded tutorials, half-day workshops and multi-partner project sessions. The event will also host the Young People Programme and unplugged sessions fostering the networking and the exchange of information on relevant issues, recent research outcomes and career opportunities.  
 DATE 20 25   is the 28th edition of an event that has always been the place for researchers, young professionals and industrial partners to meet, present their research and discuss the current development and next trends, with high emphasis on social interaction.  
 At DATE 20 25   , the DATE community, again, comes together for the conference in an intensive three-day format, focussing on interaction as well as further strengthening the community. The vast majority of regular papers will be presented in technical sessions using short flash-presentations, where the emphasis is on poster-supported live interactions (in addition to the common full-length presentation videos available before, during and after the conference). By this, we continue to focus on the core value of conferences: meeting, discussing and exchanging.

    24th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks (ICIN 2021)   
  
 The theme of the conference for 2021 is the melding of network and computing services that is clearly demonstrated by the increasing softwarization of the network services in the the core and the access networks, the rise of computing in the network and the growth of cognition in networking for management and control as well as for value added services at the edge and in the data center. Several innovations are impacting the ongoing transformations toward the network of the future and the evolution of cloud services. More and more the network fabric itself emcompasses functionality usually associated with computing as increased intelligence and cognition are necessary to address emerging requirements of distributed services, automation and network reliability. At the same time, more and more, the cloud is extending to the edge adding a number of heterogeneous networked subsystems to the Internet with a variety of requirements that further highlight the need for novel architectures , e.g., IoT systems, augmented and virtual reality and service delivery platforms. The result is the networking and computing systems becoming one, melding, as a distributed cloud/edge continuum with cognition and intelligence for emerging services. This “Computing and Networking as a Service” is the paradigm that will be central to the deployment of immersive services in many different sectors, such as e-health, self-driving cars, industrial networks, agriculture and cloud robotics.  
 In this scenario and considering the many challenges that the aforementioned  
 paradigms and technologies will bring, the theme for ICIN 2021 is proposed as:  
 “ Services everywhere: melding networking and computing in an intelligent cloud-edge continuum  ”  
  
 The conference will foster discussion about new ideas and novel approaches for future service delivery in the emerging scenario of immersive intelligence. With this vision, the conference will look beyond the current state of the art and promote the advances of Computing as a Service technologies for different application service delivery platforms.  
 Interested authors are invited to submit papers presenting novel technical research as well as broader position and visionary papers. Contributions that discuss lessons learnt and best practices, describe practical deployment and implementation experiences as well as demonstrating innovative use-cases are also and especially encouraged.  
 ICIN 2021 is technically co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE ComSoc.  
  All accepted & presented papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.  
 The best technical papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an extended version for fast-track review in the following journals:  
 IEEE Transactions on Network Service and Management (Impact Factor: 3.878) 
  MDPI Sensors (Impact Factor: 3.275) 
  Particularly innovative and visionary papers will be invited to submit a magazine-style version suitable for a wider audience to:  
 IEEE Communications Magazine (Impact Factor: 11.052)

 Notifications | 8 April 2025 
 Camera-Ready Completion Deadline | 22 April 2025 
 DIS 2025 Conference | 5-9 of July 2025 

  Deadlines specified as Anywhere on Earth  time   DIS 2025 will be an in-person-only event, and authors must present their work in person. Presenting online or with a video will not be possible. Accepted papers whose authors do not present may have their paper withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library. We encourage you to ensure you can make it to Funchal between the 5th and 9th of July 2025 before you submit to DIS’25.  
 Conference  Theme  
 In a time of unprecedented global change, DIS 2025 focuses on designing for sustainability, urging us to rethink our relationship with the planet and its environments and oceans. As designers and researchers, we face the challenges of navigating through these uncertain times, but the inherent disruption the coming changes entail also offers us an opportunity to recalibrate and retarget our approaches toward achieving a more sustainable future. Leaning into these ideas, the theme of DIS 2025 encourages us to explore alternative approaches that move beyond human-centered design, emphasizing the importance of ecological systems and our interconnectedness with all forms of life. By rethinking the boundaries between humans, non-humans, technology, and nature, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable and symbiotic future.  
 DIS’25 welcomes work addressing the design of interactive systems in the broadest possible sense. In addition, we particularly encourage submissions that address the DIS’25 conference theme.  
 Contribution Areas  
 DIS 2025 includes the following five contribution areas for submissions: Critical Computing and Design Theory, Design Methods and Processes, Artifacts and Systems, Research Through Design, and AI and Design. We particularly encourage submissions that address one of these five contribution areas, each described in further detail below:  
 Critical Computing and Design Theory  
 This area invites papers on the topics of critical computing, design theory and their overlap. Critical computing encompasses the reimagination as well as analysis and critique of technologies in the world—i.e., the political, ethical, and moral dimensions of computing and the interactive systems we create. Design theory encompasses knowledge around critical-reflective design and research practice. We welcome epistemologically pluralistic approaches, spanning disciplines, theories, and methods, including those that question or confront technological progress. The area seeks papers that explore and expand the relationships among design inquiry, politics, aesthetics, ethics, pragmatism, and craftsmanship.  
 Design Methods and Processes  
 This area invites papers that document, innovate, and advance the methods, approaches, and processes used in interaction design, UX design, and service design across industry, academia, and the public sector. We are particularly interested in methodological contributions that push the boundaries of current practice, exploring new scales, audiences, and contexts for design. This includes innovative methods that enable designers to address complex, multi-layered problems, engage with underrepresented or hard-to-reach communities, and adapt to diverse, evolving technological landscapes.  
 Artifacts and Systems  
 This area invites papers that analyze, evaluate, and/or reflect on artifacts and interactive systems across a wide range of materials, fabrication methods, and technologies. We encourage papers that expand our understanding of meaningful interactions (including but not limited to sensing and actuation) and how they can be designed to support more sustainable, equitable, and resilient outcomes. We especially call for projects that engage with the experience of the material, temporal, and spatial aspects of designing objects, systems, and spaces.  
 Research Through Design (RtD)  
 The RtD area invites research that presents contributions resulting from the exploration of design practices, materials, artifacts, technologies, and interfaces. Core to this area is an iterative, hands-on engagement, where design probes act as lenses for uncovering new insights and implications in a wide variety of design research processes.  
 AI and Design  
 This area invites papers that make a design contribution to artificial intelligence. We hope to receive papers on design for AI (making AI things), design with AI (using AI to help or automate design), design of agents and robots (such as their social presence), responsible AI, and design AI and its regulations. Contributions may include resources, methods, and tools for design; AI artifacts and systems; first-person experiences of designing with or for AI; conceptual frameworks for combining design knowledge and AI; empirical studies with a sensitivity for human needs and AI capabilities. Many papers that authors consider submitting to this subcommittee will also be a match to one of the other subcommittees. As a guide, we suggest you submit papers to this subcommittee when the paper makes an equal contribution to Design and to AI or in cases where reviewers need a deep background in both design and AI.  
 Special Note on Broader Impact   
 At DIS 2025, all submissions will be assessed based on their broader impact on society and/or the environment. We encourage authors to address the positive and negative, actual and potential, and/or pragmatic significance of their work; that is, they should engage in substantive and reflective discussions of the impact of their research beyond a narrow intellectual contribution to the field.  
 Preparing Your Submissions  
 As part of the submission process, authors must submit an abstract, keywords, author list, and meta-data related to the submission’s contents by 13th January 2025. Authors will also be asked to select a ranked list of between one and three contribution areas that fit their submission paper. This content will be used to assign your paper to one of the subcommittees. It is not necessarily the case that your submission will be handled by a subcommittee that aligns with the contribution area you choose as a first preference. You can change the title and abstract as often as you like before the final submission deadline on 20 January 2025, but the author list and order must remain unchanged.  
  
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID  ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID  from the start and has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all their published authors. ACM is committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Paper length and format  
 Papers do not have a page limit. Authors are instead encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. The length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words or below 4,000 words will be considered for desk rejection. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose, too short if they omit important details, neglect relevant prior art, or tamper with formatting rules to save on page count.  
 It is important that your submission is formatted correctly. Incorrectly formatted submissions might be rejected. Full online guidance is available from the ACM: https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions   
 Templates are available for several platforms:  
 Microsoft Word 
  LaTeX | (Use sample-manuscript.tex for submissions) 
  Overleaf (Latex) | (or search for | ACM Conference Proceedings Primary Article | ) 
  First, authors prepare their manuscript in the designated single-column format in PDF using LaTeX or Microsoft Word. LaTeX users should use \documentclass[manuscript, review]{acmart}. For an anonymous submission, use \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} to automatically replace the authors for “ANONYMOUS AUTHOR(S)”. The authors then submit the PDF and the source files via PCS  . Reviewers will review the papers in the single-column format.  
 Upon conditional acceptance of an article, authors revise the manuscript and submit publication-ready source files to PCS  . The ACM workflow requests authors to produce final publications (PDF and HTML5) by themselves using TAPS: https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow

 ACM publications are reviewed and read by many people. Making your paper accessible will help to promote the equal participation of people with disabilities. This section describes how to check if your PDF is accessible and how to fix the most common accessibility problems. For more information please refer to Adobe’s accessibility resource center.  
 How do I test if my PDF is accessible?  
 The document should be tagged. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Description’ tab. Look for ‘Tagged PDF: Yes’ among the set of advanced properties. If you do not have access to Adobe Acrobat, try selecting some text in the PDF and pasting it into a text editor. If you can’t do this, or the text looks wrong, chances are your document is not readable with a screen reader.  
 Check the accessibility. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. ‘Accessibility’. ‘Full Check’. The checker will report accessibility problems.  
 Fonts should be embedded, or your PDF will need to be regenerated, and you may lose the accessibility that you have added. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the ‘File’ menu. ‘Document properties’. ‘Fonts’ tab. All of the fonts should have the word ’embedded’ in parentheses after the font name (unless they are not visible in the final document).  
 How do I fix accessibility problems?  
 Word users should correct as many problems as possible in the Word source file rather than the PDF, as described in the next section. On a PC, the Adobe plugin for Word can export accessibility features from the Word document into the PDF.  
 On a Mac, this is not the case. Those using Word on a Mac, and all LaTeX users will need to edit the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat. A better basic PDF may be produced by using latex2pdf as opposed to ps2pdf. See also the WebAim PDF Accessibility primer [ http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/resources.html  ], which provides information for OpenOffice users.  
 The accessibility checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro provides help with fixing many accessibility problems. The following steps are for Adobe Acrobat Pro 9. For more detailed instructions for Adobe Acrobat Pro XI see the Accessible PDF guidelines. You can also find more information on Adobe’s accessibility resources page  
 Add tags. | Go to the ‘Advanced’ menu. Select ‘Accessibility’, then ‘Add tags to document’. 
  Add alternative text for figures. | Context-click the Figure, select ‘Properties’, and fill in ‘Alternate Text’. If no ‘Properties’ option appears, go to the ‘Advanced’ menu, select ‘Touch Up Reading Order’, and then try context-clicking on the figures again, looking for an ‘Edit alternate text’ option. 
  Specify the document language. | Go to the ‘File’ menu. Select ‘Properties’, then the ‘Advanced’ tab, ‘Language’ field. In some versions of Acrobat, the ‘Properties’ option is called ‘Document Properties’. In some versions, the ‘Language’ field is in a ‘Reading Options’ tab. 
  Define tab order. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Pages’. 
  Click on any page, then type Ctrl-A (or Command-A on a Mac) to select all the pages. 
  Go to the ‘Options’ menu in the top right of the dialogue box (icon showing two cogs), and select ‘Page Properties’. 
  In the ‘Tab Order’ tab, select ‘Use document structure’. 
  Make sure tables have headings. | Go to the ‘View’ menu. Select ‘Navigation tabs’, then ‘Tags’. 
  Select the ‘Tags’ tab. This panel shows the document structure as a tree. 
  Navigate to the table cells that should be headers. 
  Check they have the type <TH>. If not, then right-click on the header cell, select ‘properties’, select the ‘Tag’ tab, and change the value for ‘Type’ to ‘Table Header Cell’. 
  Creating an accessible PDF directly from Word  
 The following link provides step-by-step instructions for adding basic accessibility information to a Word document on a PC, then exporting it to a PDF document intended for ACM: Create an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word   
 These guidelines were adopted from ASSETS 2020.  
 Policies  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Anonymization Policy  
 All submissions must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the “camera-ready” version. We are using the ACM CHI Anonymization Policy  of reviewing. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the paper.  
 Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas, as noted in the submission instructions (Note: changing the text color of the author information is not sufficient). Make sure that no description that can easily reveal authors’ names and/or affiliations is included in the submission (e.g., too detailed descriptions of where user studies were conducted). Authors should also remove any information in the acknowledgments section that reveals the authors or the institution (e.g., specific supporting grant information). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document’s meta-data (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgments section be left blank as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution.  
 Further suppression of identity in the body of the submission is left to the authors’ discretion. Authors must leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and use instead “As described by Jones et al. [10], …”  
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models  
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk-reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regard to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
 Review Process  
 After the submission deadline, each paper will be assigned to a split committee during the PCS submission process in consultation with SCs, and at the discretion of the technical program chairs. The DIS 2025 paper committees will be composed of Associate Chairs that collectively represent expertise across all contribution types. The process will be similar to the DIS 2024 conference and is intended to foster discussion across contribution types and also ensure equitable workload across ACs.  
 SCs will then assign each paper to a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each external reviewer and the 2AC (who will be blind wrt the authors’ identity) will each write a detailed review of their assigned submissions and assess the contribution of the research to the field. Thus, each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews. As part of this process, we will strive to find ACs and reviewers who are experts in the topic area of each submission. We also highly encourage all authors to sign up and volunteer to be reviewers.  
 After the reviews have been written, the 1AC for a paper will examine the paper and review content, trigger discussions among the review panel if required, and write a meta-review of the paper that summarizes the three submitted reviews. If 1ACs disagree with the other reviews, they will be required to write a review as well as a meta-review; we will strive to distinguish between the 1AC’s assessment of the submission and the summarisation of the other reviews.  
 The 1AC will present a recommendation for the paper’s acceptance or rejection to the SC responsible for that submission. SCs and ACs will meet at a virtual program committee meeting with the technical program chairs to discuss the final acceptance of papers for inclusion in the program  
 Accepted papers will be included in the Proceedings of Designing Interactive Systems 2025 and will become available in ACM Digital Library.  
 Upon Acceptance of Your Paper  
 Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection of their paper on or before the notification date of 8th April 2025. Meta reviews will describe any further changes that the authors are expected to make to the paper prior to its publication. These should be made as part of a “camera-ready submission” and submitted to PCS by the deadline of 22nd April 2025. Final changes will be checked by members of the program committee prior to making a final acceptance of the paper. If authors are unable to meet the requirements for changes, the program chairs will be notified and may reject the paper.  
 Accepted authors should ensure they have obtained permission to use licensed content and images that depict identifiable people in their conference contributions (paper/pictorial, videos, and presentations). Responsibility for obtaining permission to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the DIS conference. All accepted submissions require a signed form assigning copyright or license to the ACM, an upfront fee to ACM to enable Open Access, or institutional enrollment in the ACM Open  program. More information on rights management can be found here: https://authors.acm.org/  . Finally, and as part of this rights management process, presenting authors may be asked to opt-in to and grant permission to record and/or stream their presentations at the conference.  
 Accepted submissions will also be asked to prepare and submit a short teaser video (approximately one minute) to promote contributions at the conference and to share the work with the broader community.  
 Additionally, each accepted submission requires a full conference registration fee to be paid unless the person presenting the paper or pictorial is a first-author student, in which case, a student registration fee has to be paid.  
 All published papers will appear online in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.  
 At the conference, authors of accepted submissions must present their work and be available to answer questions from other conference participants. Presenters of papers will have a presentation slot at the conference of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Information on presentations will be sent by email to the corresponding author. Papers whose authors do not present in any form may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.

 Due to the perduring COVID-19 pandemic and taking into account the current contamination numbers in France, ICIN 2022 will be held as a virtual conference on March 07-10, 2022.    
 25th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks (ICIN 2022)    
 On behalf of the Organizing and Technical Program Committees, we are pleased to welcome you to the 25th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks (ICIN 2022)  will be held from March 7 to 10, 2022 in Paris, France.  
  For the 2022 edition, ICIN is focusing on the move towards “NextG” and the upcoming 6G that is clearly up-to-the-minute and probably happening faster than expected now that initial 5G deployments are a reality. The need for ambient connectivity at the network edge requires novel thinking and the already engaged convergence between Network, IT and Cloud systems is still an enabler for efficient cooperation between all network technologies (wireless, optic, satellite, IoT and low-power, etc). These tendencies are aligned with the growing adoption of cognitive approaches for management and control, as well as for specific services at the edge and at critical technical domains using highly optimized deployment models in terms of resource and energy use.  
 Several innovations are impacting the ways to address emerging requirements from all sectors of the social and economical domains (health, environment, agriculture, industry, banking, etc.) that are also evolving with digitalization. The extraction of valuable and tailored services along with the extension of the network reach and the software-based automation of its operation are 3 main axes to which schemes for high reliability and adaptability are extremely needed to capitalize on the openness and heterogeneity that beyond 5G and 6G networks would drive.  
 While pushing towards super connectivity, including responsible and social-oriented evolutions of networks is structural. In addition to technical drivers, addressing social aspects will be important for 6G. In this regard, there is a need for rethinking the requirements and use cases along with the evolution in all the above-mentioned sectors and rely on a variety of complementary mechanisms enabling the new generation of network and service offerings to act for a human then a digital world.  
  Considering the many challenges that the aforementioned paradigms and technologies will bring, the theme for ICIN 2022 is:  
 “Paving the way to an inclusive and sustainable 6G”    
 The conference will foster discussion about new ideas and novel approaches for future 6G networks and services and their enabling technologies and mechanisms in the emerging scenario of immersive connectivity, security and intelligence. With this vision, the conference will look beyond the current state of the art and promote the advances of network of networks with control and management approaches that foster reliability and optimality for applications and services that leverage societies and business.  
 Interested authors are invited to submit papers presenting novel technical research, research related to business impact or mechanisms of new technologies, as well as broader position and visionary papers. Contributions that discuss lessons learnt and best practices, describe practical deployment and implementation experiences as well as demonstrating innovative use-cases are also and especially encouraged.  
 ICIN 2021 is technically co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE ComSoc and ACM SIGMOBILE In-Cooperation.  
  All accepted & presented papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.  
 The best papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an extended version for fast-track review in the following journals:  
 IEEE Communications Magazine (Impact Factor: 10.356) 
  IEEE Transactions on Network Service and Management (Impact Factor: 4.682) 
   
 We are honored to organize ICIN 2022 in Paris, France and we are looking forward to your contributions to the continued success of the conference!

 Since their introduction at DIS 2014 in Vancouver, pictorials have become a first-class way of communicating design research. Pictorials are papers in which the visual components (e.g. diagrams, sketches, illustrations, renderings, photographs, annotated photographs, and collages) play a major role in conveying the ideas and contributions of a study in addition to the accompanying text. Pictorials leverage the power of visual communication with the effective use of visual languages and high-quality images. They may have a practical or theoretical nature or both. As design perspectives have increasingly become integrated in HCI practice and research, new approaches are needed to communicate design practices, processes, products and artifacts to the HCI community. Through Pictorials, researchers, practitioners, industry professionals, artists, designers, and students from various disciplines, including engineering, interaction design, computer science, product design, media studies and the arts are encouraged to express and unpack their design practices and projects in visually rich ways. The Pictorials format helps foster discussions among authors, conference attendees, and the wider community through the sharing of novel methods, insights and lessons learned from engaging in or with the design of interactive systems and artifacts.  
 Pictorials published at DIS2025 are ACM archival publications and will be made available through the ACM in the Digital Library. As with the papers track, they will be double-blind peer reviewed and will stand as the same quality of contribution as technical program papers. A good Pictorial requires precision and contextualization, but in terms of evidence and detail in argumentation, should aim at the level of a short paper rather than a full paper. However, Pictorials are not simply short papers. They work best when you need to show work that requires visual elements, like documentations of design processes, for example. Pictorials are a great form for reporting design work and natural to designers, who are sometimes rightfully skeptical about how much power words have in capturing design.  
 Pictorials are meant to contribute to knowledge in themselves rather than document concepts, methods, and processes, we already know. Visual components can be contributions to design knowledge in and of themselves, as a form of making, but they should also be accompanied by a narrative that helps the DIS/Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) audience understand what the knowledge contribution is. It is this scaffolding that transforms a Pictorial into research and guarantees that it can be treated as an argument in research discourse. At the same time, the textual narrative should be just that – a scaffolding to support the contribution of the visual content.  
 Like any good piece of research, the contribution must be made clear!   
 Preparing Your Pictorial  
 DIS 2025 has two submission deadlines for pictorials. The first deadline, January 13, 2025,  requires you to submit a title, abstract of less than 150 words, and meta-data including authors and keywords for your pictorial. This Notice of Intent (NOI) is an entry in PCS  . We will use this information to help plan the specifics of the review process. The second deadline, January 20, 2025  is for the final version of your pictorial. You can also update your previously submitted title, abstract and other metadata as needed.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Pictorial Formatting  
 Pictorials must be submitted using the DIS Pictorials templates (below) and not exceed 12 pages  , excluding references. On the first page of the submission please keep with the template and include the submission’s title, author(s) and their affiliation(s) (leave blank for double blind review), and a written abstract of no more than 150 words succinctly describing the background and context of the pictorial as well as its contribution to the DIS community. While the template’s first page contains only text, you can add images or other graphical content and otherwise use the space creatively like you would on the remaining pages. Further written parts known from other conference formats such as Introduction, Conclusion, Discussion, Acknowledgements, and References are optional. The main part of the submission should be an annotated visual composition and we encourage submissions to use the format creatively. Consider this review  of visual strategies in Pictorials for further inspiration.  
 PCS allows file sizes up to about 150 MB, but we suggest that you keep reviewers in mind and experiment with lower resolution to make the submission considerably smaller.  
 We strongly advise you to use the InDesign template to compose your Pictorial. If you do not have access to InDesign, please use the Word or Powerpoint templates.  
 DIS2022 | Pictorials InDesign Template 
  DIS2022 | Pictorials Word Template 
  DIS2022 | Pictorials Powerpoint Template 
  All submissions will be made through the New Precision Conference website. The total size of all submitted materials, including a video figure, should not exceed 150 MB.  
 The following are examples of well-formed Pictorials:  
 The Tuning of Materials: A Designer’s Journey (DIS ’16) 
  Designing for an other Home: Expanding and Speculating on Different Forms of Domestic Life (DIS ’18) 
  Sensing Kirigami (DIS ’19) 
  Designing with Intimate Materials and Movements: Making “Menarche Bits” (DIS ’20) 
  Entangled Reflections on Designing with Leaky Breastfeeding Bodies (DIS ’21) 
  Spooky Technology: The ethereal and otherworldly as a resource for design (DIS ’22) 
  Tactful Feminist Sensing: Designing for Touching Vaginal Fluids (DIS ‘23) 
  VOICON: Geometric Motion-Based Visual Feedback in Voice User Interface (DIS ‘24) 
  Creating an accessible PDF directly from InDesign or PowerPoint  
 Pictorial authors using InDesign, read this guide  to add alt text using InDesign and to generate an accessible PDF from InDesign. Follow these instructions  if you created your pictorial in PowerPoint. They are similar to creating accessible PDFs from Word by instructing users to run the accessibility checker and fixing errors in the source file (e.g., PowerPoint), and generating the PDF.  
 Consider this review  of alt-text patterns in Pictorials for further guidance.  
 Policies  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Anonymization Policy  
 All pictorials must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the “camera-ready” version. We are using the ACM CHI Anonymization Policy  of reviewing. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the pictorial.  
 Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas of the pictorial, as noted in the submission instructions (Note: changing the text color of the author information is not sufficient). Make sure that no description that can easily reveal authors’ names and/or affiliations is included in the submission (e.g., too detailed descriptions of where user studies were conducted). Authors should also remove any information in the acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g., specific supporting grant information). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document’s meta-data (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgments section be left blank as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution.  
 Please note that images need to be anonymised for review too, for example by blurring or covering parts that would reveal author or institutional identities (e.g., faces, logos, etc.).  
 Further suppression of identity in the body of the pictorial is left to the authors’ discretion. We do expect that authors leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and use instead “As described by Jones et al. [10], …”  
 In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, DIS uses double-blind reviews, where external reviewers don’t know the identity of authors, and authors don’t know the identity of external reviewers. In the past few years, some authors have decided to publish their DIS submissions in public archives prior to or during the review process. These public archives have surpassed in reach and publicity what used to happen with tech reports published in institutional repositories. The consequence is that well-informed external reviewers may know, without searching for it, the full identity and institutional affiliation of the authors of a submission they are reviewing. While reviewers should not actively seek information about author identity, complete anonymization is difficult and can be made more so by publication and promotion of work during the DIS review process. While publication in public archives is becoming standard across many fields, authors should be aware that unconscious biases can affect the nature of reviews when identities are known. DIS does not discourage non-archival publication of work prior to or during the review process but recognizes that complete anonymization becomes more difficult in that context.  
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models  
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk-reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regard to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the  2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
 Submission  
 You must submit your Notice of Intent (NOI) to submit a Pictorial to the Precision Conference submission system (PCS)  by January 13, 2025. The NOI is an entry in PCS with tentative author names, title and abstract. You can make changes as many times as you like before the final submission deadline on January 20, 2025. Note that this represents a compromise between the tight review schedule this year and the submission deadline being close to public holidays. There will be no further extensions!  
 As part of the submission process, authors must submit an abstract, keywords, and meta-data related to the submission’s contents. We encourage you to include your contribution type(s) in the metadata related to your submission.  
 Review Process  
 In DIS 2025, Pictorials follow a rigorous blind peer review process similar to Full Papers. The review process is managed by the Pictorials Chairs and the Pictorials Associate Chairs (ACs). Confidentiality of submissions is maintained throughout the review process. A list of the AC’s serving on the DIS2025 Pictorials Program Committee can be viewed on the Organisers Page.   
 Reviewers will use below questions to assess submissions. We provide them here for authors to consider before submitting their work.  
 Does the Pictorial make a contribution to DIS/HCI communities (and beyond) and state its contribution clearly? 
  Is the Pictorial well-situated, framed and well referenced within DIS and HCI especially, and outside of HCI where needed? (but please note: it is not necessary to reference everything about visual presentation that has ever been advanced by any discipline) 
  Are images/diagrams emphasized over text as the primary means of communicating the research contribution? 
  Does your work require and take advantage of the Pictorial format, or would it be clearer in a more text-based form? 
  Does the Pictorial represent a visual quality (image quality, layout, typography) high enough to convey the message of the submission in an engaging and effective way? 
  Does every visual component (image, diagram, picture etc.) used in the Pictorial play a meaningful role and clearly present the idea on its own or with the support of text? 
  Does the text and visual components of the pictorial support each other well in weaving the main argument/s of the pictorial? 
  Are the implications for HCI and/or interaction design clear? These may be analytic, generative, synthesis-oriented, and even manifestos. 
  Acceptance Rate, Relation to other Submissions, and Copyrighted Materials  
 Pictorials are expected to be original work created specifically for the pictorials track. Expect the track to be competitive and submit your best work. Expect an acceptance rate of around 20-25%.  
 Please do not submit work you have submitted elsewhere with a few images added. Doing so may violate dual submission rules. You may submit previously published work to which you have added significant visual content, provided only that such work is clearly and prominently attributed as such in a footnote to the title with a clear description of what the pictorial uniquely contributes or adds to the previous work. In this last case, at least 30% of the material must be new, per ACM rules.  
 You must be the author and copyright holder of all materials you submit, particularly all visual materials. Submitted work must comply with ACM policies, which state that you must be the owner of your images and/or obtain written approvals for included third-party materials. If authors are using third-party images as a key source for their pictorials, they should make a note to reviewers with their submission about their plans for obtaining copyright.  
 Upon Acceptance of Your Pictorial  
 Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection of their Pictorial on or before the notification date of April 8, 2025. Meta reviews will describe any further changes that the authors are expected to make to the Pictorial prior to its publication. These should be made as part of a “camera ready submission” into PCS  by the deadline of April 22, 2025. Final changes will be checked by members of the program committee prior to making a final acceptance of the Pictorial. If authors are unable to meet the requirements for changes, the program chairs will be notified and may reject the Pictorial.  
 All accepted submissions require a signed form assigning copyright or licence to the ACM, or an upfront fee to ACM to enable Open Access. Responsibility for obtaining permissions to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the DIS conference.  
 Additionally, each accepted submission requires a full conference registration fee to be paid, unless the person presenting the Pictorial is a first-author student, in which case, a student registration fee has to be paid.  
 All published Pictorials will appear online in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.  
 At the conference, authors of accepted pictorials must be in attendance to present their pictorials and answer questions from the audience. Presenters of Papers and Pictorials will have a presentation slot of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Pictorials whose authors are not at the conference to present may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.

 SOFSEM 2025 Call for papers  
  July 23rd, 2024  Daniela Lopez de Luise   
 *************************   
 **** SOFSEM 2025 ****   

 50th International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer Science   
   
 January 20 – 23, 2025, Bratislava, Slovakia   
   
 http://www.sofsem.sk    

 Call for Papers   
   
 SOFSEM is an annual winter conference devoted to the theory and practice of   
 computer science. The conference traditionally focuses on the latest results   
 and developments of fundamental research in computer science (informatics),   
 inspired by the algorithmic challenges of our time. SOFSEM has a long tradition   
 as a high-quality research conference, and a venue where researchers from   
 academia and industry in all stages of their career can share their insights.   
 The series of SOFSEM conferences began in 1974, and was only interrupted in   
 2022 due to the covid pandemic. In 2025, at its 50th edition, SOFSEM will be   
 held as a physical event in Bratislava, Slovakia. The proceedings will be   
 published in the subseries ARCoSS (Advanced Research in Computing and Software   
 Science) of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) of Springer.   
   
 Topics   
   
 The program committee encourages submission of original research papers in all   
 areas of foundations of computer science and artificial intelligence, including   
 e.g.   
   
 * AI-based algorithms and techniques,   
 * algorithms (approximation, combinatorial, exact, online, parameterized, probabilistic,   
 streaming, etc)

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 A technique is introduced for generating novel signal processing systems grounded in analog electronic circuits, called model bending. By applying the ideas behind circuit bending to models of nonlinear analog circuits it is possible to create novel nonlinear signal processors which mimic the behavior of analog electronics, but which are not possible to implement in the analog realm. The history of both circuit bending and circuit modeling is discussed, as well as a theoretical basis for how these approaches can complement each other. Potential pitfalls to the practical application of model bending are highlighted and suggested solutions to those problems are provided, with examples.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 Recent research in deep learning has shown that neural networks can learn differential equations governing dynamical systems. In this paper, we adapt this concept to Virtual Analog (VA) modeling to learn the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the first-order and the second-order diode clipper. The proposed models achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks (RNNs) albeit using fewer parameters. We show that this approach does not require oversampling and allows to increase the sampling rate after the training has completed, which results in increased accuracy. Using a sophisticated numerical solver allows to increase the accuracy at the cost of slower processing. ODEs learned this way do not require closed forms but are still physically interpretable.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 In this paper we present a virtual analog model of the voltagecontrolled filter used in the EDP Wasp synthesizer. This circuit is an interesting case study for virtual analog modeling due to its characteristic nonlinear and highly dynamic behavior which can be attributed to its unusual design. The Wasp filter consists of a state variable filter topology implemented using operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) as the cutoff-control elements and CMOS inverters in lieu of operational amplifiers, all powered by a unipolar power supply. In order to accurately model the behavior of the circuit we propose extended models for its nonlinear components, focusing particularly on the OTAs. The proposed component models are used inside a white-box circuit modeling framework to create a digital simulation of the filter which retains the interesting characteristics of the original device.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 We have analyzed the Sound Effects Filter from the one-of-a-kind RCA Mark II sound synthesizer and modeled it as a Wave Digital Filter using the Faust language, to make this once exclusive device widely available. By studying the original schematics and measurements of the device, we discovered several circuit modifications. Building on these, we proposed a number of extensions to the circuit which increase its usefulness in music production.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 In addition to tone, pitch and rhythm, dynamics is one of the expressive dimensions of the performance of a music piece that has received limited attention. While the usage of dynamics may vary from artist to artist, and also from performance to performance, a systematic methodology to automatically identify the dynamics of a performance in terms of musically meaningful terms like forte, piano may offer valuable feedback in the context of music education and in particular in singing. To this end, we have manually annotated the dynamic markings of commercial recordings of popular rock and pop songs from the Smule Vocal Balanced (SVB) dataset which will be used as reference data. Then as a first step for our research goal, we propose a method to derive and compare singing voice loudness curves in polyphonic mixtures. Towards measuring the similarity and variation of dynamics, we compare the dynamics curves of the SVB renditions with the one derived from the original songs. We perform the same comparison using professionally produced renditions from a karaoke website. We relate high values of Spearman correlation coefficient found in some select student renditions and the professional renditions with accurate dynamics.

 Download   Antiderivative Antialiasing with Frequency Compensation for Stateful Systems   Pier Paolo La Pastina  ; Stefano D'Angelo    
   
 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 Employing nonlinear functions in audio DSP algorithms requires attention as they generally introduce aliasing. Among others, antiderivative antialiasing proved to be an effective method for static nonlinearities and gave rise to a number of variants, including our AA-IIR method. In this paper we introduce an improvement to AA-IIR that makes it suitable for use in stateful systems. Indeed, employing standard antiderivative antialiasing techniques in such systems alters their frequency response and may cause stability issues. Our method consists in cascading a digital filter after the AA-IIR block in order to fully compensate for unwanted delay and frequency-dependent effects. We study the conditions for such a digital filter to be stable itself and evaluate the method by applying it to the diode clipper circuit.

 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 An approach to designing dynamical systems with a three-dimensional state space is described that can be used to build a variety of non-periodic oscillators. The state space is taken to be a 3sphere, which is identified with the manifold of unit quaternions. Any such system can be described as a quaternion-valued ordinary differential equation, which is digitally realized using an approximation as a finite difference e quation. Two examples are shown. Compared to previous applications of dynamical systems used to generate audio samples, the approach described here offers a wide choice of specific flows which can neither diverge nor approach a stable limit point.

 Download   Deforming the Oscillator: Iterative Phases Over Parametrizable Closed Paths   Georg Essl    
   
 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 Iterative phase formulations allow for the generalization of many oscillatory sound synthesis methods from circles to general parametrizable loops, with or without explicit geometric contexts. This paper describes this approach, leading to the ability to perform modulation, feedback and chaotic oscillations over deformed circles that can include ill-behaved geometries, while allowing modulations or feedback to be deformed as well.

 Download   Continuous State Modeling for Statistical Spectral Synthesis   Tim-Tarek Grund  ; Henrik von Coler    
   
 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 Continuous State Markovian Spectral Modeling is a novel approach for parametric synthesis of spectral modeling parameters, based on the sines plus noise paradigm. The method aims specifically at capturing shimmer and jitter - micro-fluctuations in the partials’ frequency and amplitude trajectories, which are essential for the timbre of musical instruments. It allows for parametric control over the timbral qualities, while removing the need for the more computationally expensive and restrictive process of the discrete state space modeling method. A qualitative comparison between an original violin sound and a re-synthesis shows the ability of the algorithm to reproduce the micro-fluctuations, considering their stochastic and spectral properties.

 Download   Subjective Evaluation of Sound Quality and Control of Drum Synthesis with Stylewavegan   Antoine Lavault  ; Axel Roebel  ; Matthieu Voiry    
   
 DAFx-2022 - Vienna    
 In this paper we investigate into perceptual properties of StyleWaveGAN, a drum synthesis method proposed in a previous publication. For both, the sound quality as well as the control precision StyleWaveGAN has been shown to deliver state of the art performance for quantitative metrics (FAD and MSE of the control parameters). The present paper aims to provide insight into the perceptual relevance of these results. Accordingly, we performed a subjective evaluation of the sound quality as well as a subjective evaluation of the precision of the control using timbre descriptors from the AudioCommons toolbox. We evaluate the sound quality with mean opinion score and make measurements of psychophysical response to the variations of the control. By means of the perceptual tests, we demonstrate that StyleWaveGAN produces better sound quality than state-of-the-art model DrumGAN and that the mean control error is lower than the absolute threshold of perception at every point of measurement used in the experiment.

 Games at the Crossroads  
 EasyChair submission link:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=digra2025     
  
  DiGRA 2025 will take place in Valletta, Malta, 30th June – 4th July 2025. A pre-conference will be held one day prior to the official beginning of the conference, on Monday 30th June, with a PhD Consortium and Workshops.  
 The theme of the conference will be Games at the Crossroads, exploring games and game studies at points of (cultural, disciplinary) encounter and divergence.  
 Malta has often been characterised as a country at the crossroads. Situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, its archipelago lies at the intersection of ancient and contemporary routes of trade and migration connecting north and south, east and west. Culturally as well as geographically, it bridges Europe and North Africa, and has been marked by millennia of cultural interchange, encounter, and currents of trade and migration across the Mediterranean. Moreover, the Malta of the present has also been described as standing at the crossroads of past and future: a country with a rich heritage and tradition that is undergoing rapid change into a cosmopolitan metropolis as a hub in globalised networks of migration and capital. This positions Malta as the ideal location for discussing games at the crossroads: between cultures, between academic disciplines, between media, between different social groups and divergent interests, and between where games (and game studies) have been and where they might go next.  
 As the academic discipline of game studies concludes its first quarter-century since the launch of DiGRA and the Game Studies journal, it is a good time to pause and take stock of how far game studies has come, and where the academic field can go next. Of course, as an interdisciplinary field (Mäyrä 2008; Taylor 2024), game studies has always been positioned at the crossroads, marking a point of encounter between the humanities, the social sciences, creative practice and computer science. However, we are at a point when a lexicon of concepts, ideas and approaches has come to be established within the field. This necessitates a step back to ask questions about what game studies has achieved, as well as about the blind spots of established wisdom and existing knowledge in the field.  
 It is not just game studies as an academic discipline, though, that appears to have arrived at a crossroads. Marked by waves of layoffs, studio shutdowns, questionable labour practices, industry consolidation and simultaneous claims regarding the unsustainability of AAA game production and the unviability of independent game production, there is the feeling that games themselves – as an industry and a technocultural practice - stand at a turning point. Where do games and the games industry go from here?  
 There are other senses in which we can think of games at the crossroads. For historical, cultural and economic reasons, games have tended to be produced within contexts of privilege, and to overwhelmingly represent dominant cultures and values while marginalizing alternative identities. It is still the case that many games offer “white imperial pleasures” (Jayanth 2021). How can we think about games as sites and practices of encounters between different cultures? How can we think post- (and de-)colonially about who gets to make, play, and speak about games (Mukherjee 2017)? How do we ensure that the voices leading such conversations are not the same Western-centric ones that have tended to dominate the field, both as practice and scholarship - furthering DiGRA’s work to widen its international reach and diversity, with regional chapters and attempts to bring the annual conference to different geographical locations? How can we consider the extent to which games and game studies are open to identities and individuals marginalized on the basis of gender, orientation, ethnicity, culture, and nationality, and what happens (or can happen) in the encounter between games and such identities and individuals? (In this regard, it is an enlightening example that Ruberg and Phillips write that “the place where queerness meets games is a site of radical potential” (2018).) Can games serve as places for conversation and discussion, and for the coming together and inclusions of different identities, social groups, cultural and political perspectives – or do they still tend to contribute to entrenched hegemonies?  
 Finally, we might also want to think about the role games do – or might – play at a historical juncture that has been labeled the age of the ‘permacrisis,’ marked by catastrophic climate change, war, genocide, rising inequality, and politics of austerity, division and exclusion (Janik and Vella 2022). How are games intertwined with these permacrises? Do they contribute to the factors fuelling the crises (e.g. Abraham 2022), or can they meaningfully address them? What role do games have – or can have – at a time when ‘we’ (however we define or draw the boundaries of this ‘we’) feel ourselves to stand at a crossroads?  
 We want to encourage scholarly reflection on all the diverse ways games and play stand at the crossroads. Suggested themes include but are not limited to:  
  
 The past, present and future of game studies 
  The games industry at the crossroads 
  Games (and game studies) in a time of crisis 
  Games as points of encounter 
  Post- / decolonial perspectives on games 
  Games, game studies, and identity 
  Games and interdisciplinarity 
  Games, inclusion, exclusion 
  Regional and indigenous perspectives on games and game studies 
  Technology and platforms at the crossroads 
  Materiality, digital, analogue, and hybrid games 
  Games and meaning in a time of crises 
  Players at the crossroads 
  Neoliberalism and games 
  Gamification of work 
  Games and human rights 
   
 The submissions are invited into seven tracks:  
 Philosophy and Theory of Play & Games:  theoretical frameworks and investigations of games and play phenomena as well as meta-reflection on game studies methods and practices.  
 Game Analyses, Criticism, and Interpretation:  analyses, close-readings, and critical discussions of game texts.  
 Game History and Cultural Context:  explorations of game histories, contemporary game cultures and regional game studies.  
 Play and Players:  empirical research on play and playful behaviour, players, fandom, and game communities.  
 Game Design, Production, and Distribution:  reflections on making and research creation, processes of production and design, and the games market.  
 Serious Games and Education:  research on games and play for learning, education, and therapy, and other applications beyond game studies.  
 Analogue Games:  research on any form of analogue games, including but not limited to board games, card games, analogue roleplay games, and other forms not traditionally contemplated in digital game studies.  
 There will be several special events associated with the conference, including a PhD Consortium. It will be organised on the pre-conference day and it will allow PhD students to discuss key issues, benefit from peer support, and seek feedback from experienced scholars. It will provide opportunities for further development of research skills that will be of help to emerging scholars in achieving their academic goals.  
 The organisers also accept thematic workshop proposals (see submission guidelines below).  
   
 About DiGRA  
 The Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) was established by an international group of scholars in Tampere, Finland, after the Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference that took place in 2002. Since then, it has continued to grow, including the establishment of many regional chapters in different parts of the world.

 Submission Guidelines  
 We welcome a range of contributions to DiGRA 2025: full papers, extended abstracts, and doctoral consortium participation, and workshop proposals.  
 Full papers and extended abstracts will be peer-reviewed, published on the conference website and published in the conference proceedings available via open-access through the DiGRA Digital Library: http://www.digra.org/digital-library. Workshop proposals will be selected by the conference organisers based on non-anonymous submissions.  
 All except workshop submissions should be made via EasyChair. Workshop proposals should be sent directly to the conference email: daniel.m.vella@um.edu.mt.  
 Authors are asked to direct questions to the program chairs: Krista Bonello Rutter Giappone (kbone02@um.edu.mt), Jing Sun (Jing.Sun@xjtlu.edu.cn), and Víctor Navarro-Remesal (vnavarro@tecnocampus.cat).  
   
 Submission Types  
 Full Paper  
 Full papers are expected to be 5000–7000 words plus references, submitted as an anonymized pdf on DiGRA Submission Template. Submissions must be original, which means that they have not been published or are not under peer review elsewhere.  
 Full papers are peer-reviewed publications of original game studies research, presenting mature, complete research. Authors must present accepted full papers at the DiGRA conference. Accepted manuscripts will appear in the Proceedings of the 2025 DiGRA International Conference, which is published in the open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 Extended Abstract  
 The suggested length for an extended abstract is 500–800 words, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (only key references should be included), submitted as an anonymised pdf using the DiGRA Submission Template. Give a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system, but there is no need for extended abstracts to contain an abstract.  
 The purpose of an extended abstract is to demonstrate a contribution interesting to DiGRA audiences. An extended abstract might describe a study or research program that is underway, but might also describe a pending program of research. It might outline findings, or it might establish and discuss a research question. It might describe the study’s method or methodology, or it might focus on outcomes and results. It might describe work that is planned, work that is in progress, or work that has been completed.  
 Accepted extended abstracts will appear in open access DiGRA Digital Library.  
 PhD Consortium Submission  
 Selection for the PhD consortium will be based on an extended abstract based on an ongoing PhD research project, with a maximum of 1000 words, excluding references (see Extended Abstract guidelines, above). They should be submitted to PhD Consortium track, as NON-anonymised pdf, with a short description in the abstract field of the conference management system (there is no need for a doctoral consortium application to have an abstract).  
 Submissions must use the DiGRA 2025 submission template.  
 Workshop  
 The conference workshops are three to six hours long sessions focused on a particular game-related topic. Workshops provide an opportunity for new ideas, theories and trends to be presented and discussed. Workshops can also be practical tutorials.  
 Concise workshop proposals of no more than 1000 words (excluding bibliography) should include major objectives and expected outcomes of the workshop, the justification for the workshop informed by current trends and research, the format and activities planned for the workshop, the organisers’ background, the anticipated number of participants and the way they will be selected.  
 Please note that the submission should not be anonymous as the organisers’ background is very important in the decision-making process for workshops.  
 Workshops can be open to participants submissions (the standard model) or by invitation only, replacing the old panel format. The proposal should specify if participants can apply or the list of speakers/participants is set, as in the old panels.  
 Submit workshop proposals directly by email to daniel.m.vella@um.edu.mt by 10 February 2025.  
 Number of submissions per author  
 Authors cannot submit more than two papers and/or extended abstracts to DiGRA 2025, including PhD Consortium submissions. An individual can be co-authors on as many full papers and extended abstracts as they like, but cannot submit more than two as main author/presenter. If the limit is exceeded, only the two first submissions will be reviewed.  
 The limit does not include participation in workshops.

 30 June - 4 July 2025  - Malta    
 f  t    

 Conference Venue  
 We are excited to host DiGRA 2025 at one of Malta’s most unique venues, the University of Malta’s Valletta Campus. This campus is housed in the historic Old University Building, dating back to the late 16th century, originally established by the Jesuits as a centre for education and religious instruction. Located in the heart of Valletta, Malta’s capital city - and a Baroque walled city recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site - the campus offers a truly special setting. The walls of this university have a lot of stories to tell!  

 The City of Valletta  
 The location of the venue makes it convenient for our visitors to explore Malta to its fullest. You will find yourself surrounded by bars, churches, museums, cafes, restaurants, and historic forts and palaces. Additionally, the campus offers easy access to government offices, cultural institutions, and amenities, enhancing the overall experience for students and visitors alike.  
 Despite its historical setting, the Old University Building has recently undergone a complete renovation, and is equipped with modern facilities, including lecture halls, conference rooms, and study spaces, supporting a wide range of academic and cultural activities.  
 Valletta is well-connected to the rest of the country with numerous bus and ferry terminals, making it easy for you to explore Malta on a whim.

 LLNL is issuing a call for proposals for experiments in the Discovery Science (DS) program on the NIF starting nominally in FY2026 and extending into FY2027. We expect to allocate 14 days of facility time for DS experiments beginning in FY2026; this is necessary to accommodate disruptions to planned campaigns. As in previous years, if the FY25 or FY26 enacted budgets contain a significant cut to LLNL’s ICF Program, the time awarded to Discovery Science under this call may be reduced.  
 The application process is as follows:  
 Applicants shall enter a title and upload a Letter of Intent (LOI) via the | NIF User Portal | by | June 26, 2024. | The template for the LOI is available for download from the NIF User Portal. The LOI should be no more than three pages in length, including references and figures. The LOI should emphasize what capabilities are required from the facility to support the experiments, and should provide enough detail of the proposed investigations to allow the NIF User Office and the DS Program Leader to provide meaningful feedback. Applicants are free to submit as many proposals as they wish. A separate LOI must be submitted for each proposed campaign. 
  After NIF User Office and DS Program Leader feedback on the LOI is provided, applicants so invited may submit the full written proposal via the | NIF User Portal | by | September 18, 2024 | . Based on a review of the full proposal by the DS Technical Review Committee (TRC), the NIF Director will invite submitters of the top proposals to prepare an oral presentation in support of their proposal, which will be presented in the late-October time frame, via remote access. Decisions on the proposals are expected to be communicated before the end of December. Format and other relevant details for the oral presentation will be provided at the time invitations are made. 
  Facility access is allocated in units of time (typically “shot days”). The number of shots that can be accomplished per day is a function of experimental complexity. Awards will be made commensurate with the science needs of the proposal. Awards to date have been for one to three days per campaign. All researchers are welcome to apply, including those who have been awarded time in previous solicitations. The NIF DS TRC will use its discretion in evaluating new proposals from teams that have previously been awarded time but have not yet taken shots or produced and published data. Teams that have previously been awarded time and have taken shots will need to provide a description of what has been learned, the status of the analysis, and a list of any publications from previous NIF DS shots that have appeared or have been submitted for publication.  
 A resource for potential applicants is the NIF User Guide, which is available online at this link.  Any questions regarding this process or details regarding the NIF facility should be directed to NIF User Office staff. We are providing a single point of contact for facility questions; only responses from the NIF User Office Director, Kevin Fournier, should be taken as the facility guidance on capabilities  .  
 Proposal subject areas:  
 Researchers may apply for NIF facility time to execute experiments in any area of science accessible on the NIF. Proposals will be judged on their scientific merit and technical achievability. Science relevant to fusion ignition will be considered but will be judged solely on the basis of its quality as fundamental science. In particular, the results of the experiment must be of significant interest in other fields, consistent with guidelines for publication in a highly ranked journal. Examples of previously awarded successful proposals are available for prior years through 2023.   
 All researchers involved in NIF experiments will be required to follow LLNL policies and procedures regarding site access, computer use, and related topics. The PI for each research team that is awarded facility time through this call is encouraged to present their proposed research program at the NIF User Group Meeting that will take place in February 2024. (An award of shot time does not come with funding to support the PI’s travel to the NIF User Group Meeting.)  
 The facility welcomes proposals that use existing platforms, diagnostics, target fabrication and other capabilities. We also welcome proposals to develop new platforms that will use existing diagnostic capabilities in new ways or develop new capabilities. It is no longer necessary to choose one of these categories when creating a record in the NIF User Portal.  
 Research groups that have a novel idea that they think will make a good proposal in the future are invited to contact the nifuseroffice  [at] llnl.gov  (NIF User Office)   to request guidance on developing their ideas into concepts that can be pursued at the NIF or proposed in subsequent calls for DS proposals.  
 Eligible applicants:  
 Principal Investigators, Experimental Leads, and team members may be associated with a national laboratory, academic institution, or the private sector, and may be from the United States (US) or outside the US. Each LOI will undergo both technical review as well as a national security review consistent with LLNL and NNSA policies. Invitations to submit full proposals following the LOI review will reflect the outcome of that review. (Proposals submitted in response to this call will undergo both technical and national security reviews as well.)  
 How to apply:  Applicants will upload a completed LOI template via the NIF User Portal  by June 26, 2024  . Full proposals must be completed and submitted electronically by September 18, 2024  . Proposal instructions can be found on the Call for Proposal Website.   
 Further information regarding the LOI submission is available by contacting the NIF User Office: (925) 422-2179, nifuseroffice  [at] llnl.gov  (nifuseroffice[at]llnl[dot]gov.)

42. Conference DNA_1:
Top  
 Biomolecular computing has emerged as an interdisciplinary field that draws together molecular biology, chemistry, computer science and mathematics. Our knowledge on DNA nanotechnology and biomolecular computing increases exponentially with every passing year. The annual international meeting in the field began in 1995 right after the landmark work by L. Adleman, who solved an instance of the Hamiltonian path problem by DNA molecules and opened the door to this new field. Since then, the meeting has been a forum where scientists with different backgrounds, yet sharing a common interest in biomolecular computing meet, and present their latest results.  
 The annual meeting was called International Meeting on DNA Based Computers   till 2003 (DNA9), and from 2004 (DNA10) it is called International Meeting on DNA Computing.   From 2009 (DNA15), the meeting is called International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming.

 Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS)   
   
 Mission  
 The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is a forum for discussion of dynamic languages, their implementation and application. While mature dynamic languages including Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Self, Prolog, and APL continue to grow and inspire new converts, a new generation of dynamic scripting languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP Tcl, Lua, and Clojure are successful in a wide range of applications. DLS provides a place for researchers and practitioners to come together and share their knowledge, experience, and ideas for future research and development.  
 http://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/DLS/   
 Latest  
 In 2024, the Dynamic Languages Symposium will take a hiatus.  
 We are planning to return in 2025!  
 If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to the steering committee chair!

  Title: SqueakJS: A Modern and Practical Smalltalk that Runs in Any Browser 
  Conference: DLS 2014 
  Paper: | https://doi.org/10.1145/2661088.2661100 
  Citation: This paper reports on SqueakJS, a fully compatible Squeak/Smalltalk implemented in pure JavaScript. In 2014, it demonstrated that with thoughtful implementation techniques, browsers and their JavaScript VMs can enable applications as dynamic and interactive as Smalltalk environments. Furthermore, the paper details how powerful programming language features such as object enumeration, application snapshotting, custom graphics interfaces, as well as basic file abstractions can be realized inside the browser environment. | Today, SqueakJS continues to be used in education, for web applications, and as environments to preserve important parts of Smalltalk’s history, and with it, computing history.

  Title: Cast Insertion Strategies for Gradually-Typed Objects 
  Conference: DLS 2013 
  Paper: | https://doi.org/10.1145/2508168.2508171 
  Citation: This paper explored the costs, both at micro and macro scale of various strategies for protecting gradual types in a gradually-typed programming language, examining how different strategies affected untyped typed, or both components of code. It is a seminal contribution to understanding the performance of gradual typing, which since then has been an area of important research. The strategies used in gradually-typed languages today can trace their lineage back to the strategies described and proposed in this paper. In particular, the proposed hybrid approach has been adapted time and time again by many systems, giving this work a lasting impact beyond its original scope.

  Title: Self-optimizing AST interpreters 
  Conference: DLS 2012 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2384577.2384587 
  Citation: Over the past decade, the authors and their collaborators have taken the ideas from this paper and turned it into the Truffle and GraalVM system which has revolutionized how we implement languages on the JVM. Today, the GraalVM is a major product and Truffle is a language implementation technology producing high-performance implementations of everything from Ruby to C all built upon the ideas of AST rewriting in the interpreter.

  Title: PyPy's Approach to Virtual Machine Construction 
  Conference: DLS 2006 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176753 
  Citation: The 2006 DLS paper "PyPy's Approach to Virtual Machine Construction" introduced the PyPy Python interpreter and the RPython framework. Both are still highly relevant in various areas to this day and will continue to be in influential for many years, thus demonstrating highly impressive long-term vision and impact. The paper laid the theoretical and practical foundations of constructing a virtual machine from a high-level description and was consequently built upon by numerous follow-up publications. The software, which continues to be developed by a large and active open source community, proved extensively usable in multiple academic and industrial contexts.

 Welcome to the Educational Data Mining Conference 2025  
  July 20-23, Palermo, Italy  
 In an era dominated by artificial intelligence, where machines can surpass human performance in numerous cognitive tasks, it’s imperative that our educational systems evolve. As AI reshapes the workforce, traditional incentives that motivate learning are rapidly changing. This shift presents a unique opportunity—and necessity—for the educational data mining (EDM) community to redefine learning objectives and outcomes. We are poised to lead the transformation in education by leveraging our dual expertise in AI and educational science, ensuring that future generations benefit from these advances.  
 Topic of Interests  
 Developing new techniques for mining educational data 
  Domain Knowledge Modeling 
  Educational Recommenders, Instructional Sequencing, and Personalized Learning 
  Equity, Privacy, Transparency, and Fairness 
  Human Factors, Transparency, and Explainability 
  Learner Cognitive and Behavior Modeling and its association with performance 
  Learner Knowledge and Performance Modeling 
  Comparing Human and Artificial Intelligence 
  Learning Analytics 
  Social and Collaborative Learning 
  Reproducibility 
  We are thrilled to welcome you to the beautiful city of Palermo, where we will explore how artificial intelligence is reshaping learning and teaching in profound ways.  
 This year, we are excited to feature two parallel conferences: the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) and Learning at Scale (L@S)  . Running concurrently, these events provide a unique opportunity for attendees to engage with cutting-edge research and discussions in both AI in education and large-scale learning systems. This joint gathering aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and offer a comprehensive platform for shaping the future of education, empowering both learners and educators.  
 Join us in Palermo to be part of this dynamic exchange of ideas with a global community of innovators and educators as we collectively redefine the educational paradigms of tomorrow.  
 We look forward to inspiring discussions and groundbreaking insights at EDM 2025!

 Call for Contributions  
  
 The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to share research and experience on all aspects on dynamic languages.  
 After two decades of dynamic language research and DLS, it is time to reflect and look forward to what the next two decades will bring. This year’s DLS will therefore be a special DLS focusing on the Future of Dynamic Languages. To do the notion of “symposium” justice, we will actively invite speakers to present their opinions on where Dynamic Languages might be, will be, or should be going in the next twenty years.  
 Speakers will be announced step by step over the coming weeks.  
 As a research venue, we also invite high quality papers reporting original research and experience related to the design, implementation, and applications of dynamic languages. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 innovative language features 
  innovative implementation techniques 
  innovative applications 
  development environments and tools 
  experience reports and case studies 
  domain-oriented programming 
  late binding, dynamic composition, and run-time adaptation 
  reflection and metaprogramming 
  software evolution 
  language symbiosis and multi-paradigm languages 
  dynamic optimization 
  interpretation 
  just-in-time and ahead-of-time compilation 
  soft/optional/gradual typing 
  hardware support 
  educational approaches and perspectives 
  semantics of dynamic languages 
  frameworks and languages for the Cloud and the IoT 
  Submission Details   
 Submissions must neither be previously published nor under review at other events. DLS 2023 uses a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.  
 Papers are assumed to be in one of the following categories:  
 Research Papers  : describe work that advances the current state of the art  
 Experience Papers  : describe insights gained from substantive practical applications that should be of a broad interest  
 Dynamic Pearls  : describe a known idea in an appealing way to remind the community and capture a reader’s interest  
 The program committee will evaluate each paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality. The paper category needs to be indicated during submission, and papers are judged accordingly.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM SIGPLAN conference acmart format, 10 point font, and should not exceed 12 pages. Please see full details in the Instructions for Authors.  
 DLS 2023 will run a single-phase reviewing process with shepherding to help authors make their final papers the best that they can be. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library (TBC) and will be freely available for one month, starting two weeks before the event.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -
