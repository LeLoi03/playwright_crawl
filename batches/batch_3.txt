 ASPLOS 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 Synopsis  
 ASPLOS, the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, is the premier academic forum for multidisciplinary applied computer systems research spanning hardware, software, and their interaction. It focuses on practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and associated areas such as networking and storage. ASPLOS 2025 will take place in March-April 2025 in Rotterdam, co-located with EuroSys 2025.  
 ASPLOS 2025 has three submission deadlines – spring, summer and fall – which are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when they are ready. As in recent years, ASPLOS 2025 will allow the authors of some submissions to choose to apply a major revision to their submission in order to fix a well-defined list of problems.

 Scope and Expectations  
 The scope of ASPLOS 2025 covers all practical aspects related to the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. ASPLOS construes systems  broadly, and areas of interest include, but are not limited to: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, and virtualization. We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines. Research submission may be applicable to computer systems of any scale, ranging from small, ultra-low power wearable devices to large scale parallel computers and data centers. We embrace research that directly targets new problems in innovative ways. The research may target diverse goals, such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. Non-traditional topics are encouraged, and the review process will be sensitive to the challenges of multidisciplinary work in emerging areas. We welcome submission of “experience papers” that have a novel component and that clearly articulate the lessons learned. We likewise welcome submissions whereby novelty lies in furthering our understandings of existing systems, e.g., by uncovering previously unknown, valuable insights or by convincingly refuting prior published results and common wisdom. We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.  
 Alphabetically sorted areas of interest related to practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems include but are not limited to:  
 Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales 
  Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators 
  Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters 
  Memory, storage, networking, and I/O 
  Power, energy, and thermal management 
  Profiling, debugging, and testing 
  Security, reliability, and availability 
  Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data 
  Virtualization and virtualized systems 
  A good submission will typically: motivate a significant problem; propose a practical solution or approach that makes sense; demonstrate not just the pros but also the cons of the proposal using sound experimental methods; explicitly disclose what has and has not been implemented; articulate the new contributions beyond previous work; and refrain from overclaiming, focusing the abstract and introduction sections primarily on the difference between the new proposal and what is already available. The latter statement should be interpreted broadly to also encompass studies that broaden our understanding of existing systems (rather than suggest new ones), which may constitute a significant problem in its own right. Submissions will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, and clarity. Submissions are expected to adhere to SIGPLAN’s Empirical Evaluation Guidelines  and all the policies specified below.  
 Resubmissions  
 Authors of resubmitted work must describe in a separate note—to be uploaded to the submission site at submission time—the changes since the previous submission(s). This description helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit this document to one page.  
 For resubmitted work that received a “Major Revision” followed by a revised submission, the revision also counts as a submission  , so the note should describe changes relative to the revision rather than the original submission.  
 Submissions rejected from ASPLOS must not be submitted to the next two subsequent review cycles. The corresponding restrictions on ASPLOS ‘25 submissions are thus:  
 Papers rejected in 2024 Spring, or earlier, are now eligible for resubmission to ASPLOS. 
  Papers rejected in 2024 Summer may not resubmit until ASPLOS 2025 Summer (or later). 
  Papers rejected in 2024 Fall may not resubmit until ASPLOS 2025 Fall (or later). 
  These resubmission rules are strict and hold even if a submission has undergone extensive revision. If a paper is withdrawn from an ASPLOS cycle after reviews are made available  , it is considered “rejected” from that cycle (and cannot be resubmitted to the next two cycles).  
 Major Revisions  
 In addition to Accept and Reject outcomes, ASPLOS 2025 will offer some submissions a “Major Revision” decision. The authors of such submissions will be given the opportunity to apply a major revision to their work and resubmit it at the camera ready deadline (6 weeks from notification). These submissions will be provided with clear and actionable reviewer feedback for their revision, and they will be typically reviewed by some of the same reviewers as the original submission. If the revision requirements are satisfactorily met, the revised submission will be accepted.  
 Revised submissions can use 13 pages (the same length as camera-ready versions, and 2 pages more than the original submission). The additional length is intended to let authors address the revision requirements.  
 Accept or reject notifications for spring and summer major revisions will coincide with the notifications of the subsequent cycle. Notifications of fall major revisions will occur no later than two months after the revisions have been resubmitted.  
 Anonymization  
 ASPLOS employs a double-blind review process, keeping author identities concealed from reviewers and vice versa. You must therefore make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission by avoiding identifying yourself or your institution/affiliation in any of the submitted documents (except in specific fields on the HotCRP submission form designated for this purpose), either explicitly or by implication, e.g., through references, acknowledgments, online repositories that are referenced by the submission, or interaction with committee members.  
 Do not include a “reference removed for blind review” text or similar in your submission. When it is necessary to cite your own studies, cite them as written by a third party. Only if that is not possible, they can be uploaded and cited as anonymized supplemental material (see below). This applies to workshop papers that are being extended by your current ASPLOS submission, and related submissions of your own that are simultaneously under review or awaiting publication at other venues. Publication as a technical report or in an online repository does not constitute a violation of this policy, and some other exceptions apply; see the “originality and concurrent submissions” section below for details.  
 Please make sure not to reveal author and/or affiliation information through side channels and other less obvious means. For example, the metadata included in the PDF should not give away such information. If you’d like to point to a repository of, e.g., the working code of your system (which is great and much appreciated), this repository should, of course, be anonymized. It is okay and often makes sense to create anonymized repositories merely for the sake of an anonymous submission. If your system is already released to the public, rename it in your submission. You should likewise avoid inadvertently revealing affiliation in your submission by identifying your company’s name in situations where, e.g., it is clear that the authors of the submission most probably work for the company that manufactures the device or provides the service that constitutes the topic of your work; instead, please use a generic name, like “a computer server vendor X,” “a cloud service provider Y,” and such like.  
 If concealing system name or affiliation would make your paper difficult to understand, contact the program chairs to discuss exceptions to this policy. Submissions that are not properly anonymized will likely be rejected without review.  
 Anonymized Supplemental Material  
 Supplemental material may be submitted as a single-but-separate anonymized PDF file without page limit. The nature of such material is explained in the above “anonymization” section. We permit uploading such material exclusively for the purpose of handling specific anonymity issues.  
 The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, and the supplemental material mechanism should not be used as a way to circumvent this limit. The reviewers are neither required nor encouraged to read such material when making their decision.  
 Declaring Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors must register all their conflicts in their HotCRP submission page. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a submission is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem or if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the submission will be summarily rejected.  
 Both people and institutions (companies, universities, and other relevant organizations) may be declared as having a conflict of interest (COI) with respect to an author. Please declare a COI with the following for any author of your submission; please do so with respect to all your conflicts, not just restricted to program committee (PC) and extended review committee (ERC) members, as we may occasionally ask for external reviews from people outside the PC/ERC.  
 Your current institution(s) and other institutions that you were affiliated with in the past four years relative to the submission deadline; also, an institution that is about to become your employer. 
  Your PhD advisor(s), post-doctoral host(s), PhD students, and post-doctoral advisees; these COIs are forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage and close personal friends (who may potentially be reviewers); these COIs are likewise forever. 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last four years, including co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending paper submissions and co-PIs of accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Potential reviewers who shared your primary institution(s) in the last four years, or where one is actively engaged in discussions about employment with the other person’s institution. 
  When there is a direct funding relationship between an author and a potential reviewer (e.g., the reviewer is a sponsor of an author’s research on behalf of his/her company or vice versa). 
  Among PIs of research structures supported under the same umbrella funding award who (1) participate regularly in non-public meetings sponsored by that umbrella award, and (2) are regularly exposed to presentations or discussions of unpublished work at such meetings. 
  Do not declare a COI for the following cases:  
 You must not declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization or an open-source community, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a COI. 
  Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects without direct collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  Internships constitute a conflict of interest during the period of employment of the intern, but not thereafter, unless some other provision applies (e.g., co-authorship or ongoing research collaboration after the internship). Graduate students are not presumed to have an automatic COI with their undergraduate institution. On the other hand, prospective graduate students do have a COI with any institution they have applied to if they are actively engaged in discussions with any faculty member at that institution. Once they join an institution to pursue graduate studies, automatic COIs with any other prospective institutions sunset. In all these cases, the collaboration COI above still applies. 
  When in doubt, contact the program chairs and ask.  
 Declaring Authors  
 Declare all the authors of the submission upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the submission is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment.  
 Declaring Areas and Topics  
 ASPLOS emphasizes multidisciplinary research. Submissions should ideally – albeit not necessarily – emphasize synergy of two or more of the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems (broadly interpreted). Authors should therefore indicate at least one of these areas on the submission form and, preferably, more than one.  
 Authors should also indicate on the submission form more focused topics matching their work, which will be used for reviewer assignment.  
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  
 By submitting a manuscript to ASPLOS, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop. The only exceptions are (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. These are not considered prior publications. Technical reports and papers posted on public social media sites, web pages, or online repositories such as arxiv.org are not considered prior publications either. In these cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the posted work to preserve author anonymity.  
 The authors additionally guarantee that no manuscript that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted document is or will be under review for any other conference, journal, or workshop during the ASPLOS review cycle for which it was submitted. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection and possibly additional actions against the offending authors.  
 You should also adhere to the ACM Plagiarism Policy ( http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy  ), which covers a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one’s own work.  
 As usual, if in doubt, consult with the program chairs.  
 Ethical and Other Obligations  
 Authors are not allowed to break anonymity when interacting with known ASPLOS PC/ERC members, e.g., by mentioning/identifying work that they plan to submit to ASPLOS or have already submitted and is currently under review. 
  Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members in order to encourage or solicit them to bid on any submission; to attempt to sway a reviewer or PC/ERC member to review any submission positively or negatively; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted manuscripts; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members to ask about the outcomes of any submission. 
  Authors are not allowed to advertise their work during the period starting two weeks before the submission deadline and ending when the results of the review cycle are publicized. The work includes the submission itself and closely related documents such as technical reports or arxiv.org uploads. Advertisement pertains to such communication channels such as social media, community blogs, and web pages. To clarify, authors are indeed allowed to upload their submission to arxiv.org and other such online repositories; the restriction relates to advertising such postings. 
  Authors are not allowed to post in the aforementioned channels about the content of the reviews they may have received until the results of the corresponding review cycle are publicized; “shaming” (and thus potentially applying pressure on) reviewers before the review process terminates is considered unethical. 
  Authors must abide by the ACM ethics policy ( | https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics | ). 
  Violation of these policies might result in rejection of the submission and possible additional action by the ACM.  
 ACM requires that all submitting authors will be aware of the following policies in particular:  
 By submitting your article to an ACM publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Formatting and Editing  
 We will use the same format template for submission and camera-ready versions. Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class available on the official ACM site  . Your main LaTeX file should have the following structure:  
 % use the base acmart.cls  
  % use the sigplan proceeding template with the default 10 pt fonts  
  % nonacm option removes ACM related text in the submission.  
  \documentclass[sigplan,nonacm]{acmart}  
   
  % enable page numbers  
  \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  
   
  \begin{document}  
  \title{...}  
   
  \begin{abstract}  
  ...  
  \end{abstract}  
   
  \maketitle % should come after the abstract  
   
  % add the paper content here  
   
  % use the ACM bibliography style  
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}  
  \bibliography{...}  
   
  \end{document}  Your final submission should visually look similar to this sample  produced from the zip file above.  
 “Squeezing” Space is Forbidden.  Refrain from tweaking the aforementioned template and from formatting your text in a manner that violates its settings. Notably, refrain from squeezing additional space, e.g., by using \vspace or packages that manipulate vertical space. The template already generates a very dense document, and you must not make it denser. Your submission will be visually and automatically inspected using tools developed for this purpose, and it will be rejected if you violate the formatting policy, even if your PDF passed the HotCRP format check (which is unable to verify much of the requirements).  
 Page Layout and Limit.  Full submissions must not exceed 11 pages of single-spaced two-column text. This page limit applies to all text, figures, tables, footnotes, appendices, etc. The only exception is the bibliographic references section, which is not included in the page limit. The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, allowing reviewers to evaluate the work without having to consider any external or supplementary material outside this limit. The reviewers greatly value conciseness, so if you can describe your work with fewer pages than the limit, please do. All pages should be numbered.  
 Page Limit of Accepted Papers and Major Revisions.  The authors of an accepted paper are allowed to use +2 pages in the camera-ready version beyond the aforementioned page limit. The same applies to major revisions, to accommodate added experiments and such. In addition to this +2 automatic page limit increase, authors of accepted papers may purchase 1–2 more pages, if they wish (payment will be processed when registering to the conference).  
 Font Size, Tables, and Figures.  The submission’s text must use a 10pt font (not 9pt) or bigger. Labels, captions, and text within figures, graphs, and tables must use reasonable font sizes that, as printed, do not require extra magnification beyond “100%” to be legible. In particular, text inside figures/tables should generally use what appears to readers as a 9pt font or bigger after any intra-document scaling has been applied. Fonts appearing smaller than 8pt are not permitted. As noted, this and other requirements are not checked automatically by the HotCRP format checker, so it is the authors’ responsibility to check it. Figures can and should use colors but should also be color-blind friendly and readable when printed in monochrome. Spacing between figures/tables/captions/text should be determined by the latex template.  
 References.  Because references do not count against the page limit, the space they occupy should not be “optimized” away. Notably, the full, non-abbreviated first and last names of all co-authors of all citations must be specified (no “et al.”). The reference citations within the submission (numbers in square brackets) should be hyperlinked to the corresponding items in the references section, to ease the job of reviewers. Also, reviewers will very much appreciate clickable links (preferably DOI  s) associated with each entry in your references section.  
 Specifications.  The following table specifies some of the main typeset requirements. Use our mandatory latex template and follow the above instructions to make sure that these and other formatting requirements are met.  
  
 aspect | requirement 
 file format | PDF with numbered pages 
 page limit | 11 pages, not including references 
 paper size | US Letter 8.5in x 11in 
 top margin | 1in 
 bottom margin | 1in 
 left margin | 0.75in 
 right margin | 0.75in 
 column separation | 0.333in 
 body | 2-column, single-spaced 
 body font size | 10pt 
 abstract font | 10pt 
 section heading font | 12pt, bold 
 subsection heading font | 10pt, bold 
 space between section heading and text | ≥ 6pt 
 caption font | 9pt 
 fonts in figures and tables | ≥ 8pt, preferably ≥ 9pt 
 reference entries | 8pt; no page limit; list full names of all author (no “et al.”); include link to document (preferably DOI  ); make references to citations clickable 
 appendices | count towards the page limit 
  
  Submissions that violate any of these restrictions might be rejected without being reviewed.   
 Author Response Period  
 ASPLOS 2024 will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting; see exact dates specified above. Authors should generally focus their rebuttal on (1) correcting factual errors in the reviews and (2) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. When a major revision is a realistic possibility, in addition to clarifying the submitted work, rebuttals may describe new experiments and data, if doing so addresses the reviewers’ concerns. Rebuttals are optional but strongly encouraged, and their absence might indicate to reviewers that authors are not interested in improving the work. There is no explicit word limit to a rebuttal, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep it under 800 words, and reviewers are not expected to read words that exceed this limit. Authors are not allowed to attach files to the rebuttal HotCRP comment.  
 Accepted Papers  
 Submissions selected by the program committee will be conditionally accepted, subject to revision and approval by a committee member acting as a shepherd. Accepted papers will be allowed two additional pages in the proceedings (and up to two more with a fee of $200 per page). We expect that one author of each accepted paper will physically attend the conference and present the work in a dedicated time slot (unless all  authors have difficulty traveling due to such serious limitations as visa restrictions, care-giving responsibilities, and disability). By default, all accepted papers will be made available online to registered attendees before the conference at a date that depends on the review cycle. Papers accepted to the spring and summer deadlines will be published in separate volumes in advance of the conference.  
 ACM requires that all authors of accepted papers will adhere to the following policy. Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors  to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will continue in 2025 as has become a tradition at ASPLOS. Please refer to the ASPLOS 2025 AEC  web page for more information.  
 Poster and Lightning Sessions  
 In addition to the regular presentations, the program may include poster and lightning sessions. If those are included, details can be found here when they become available.  
 Wild and Crazy Ideas Session  
 The program will also tentatively include a WACI session. Details will become available later.  
 Debate Session  
 Should the program include a debate session, details will be posted here.  
 Best Paper Award  
 The committee will select a handful of papers to receive a Best Paper Award. The decision may or may not be communicated to the winning authors prior to the official announcement at the opening session of the conference.  
 Program and Registration  
 Complete program and registration information will be available on the conference website as soon as it becomes available.  
 Confidentiality  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

 Update to the AIAI Community from the Organisers  
 Dear Colleagues,  
 On behalf of the 21 st  AIAI (Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations) 2025 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects.  
 The Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations  (AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globe.  
 The h-index of the AIAI event is as high as 39  . This proves the novelty and quality of the presented-published research and its important contribution to the promotion of scientific ideas, algorithms and methods, globally. The fact that the conference Springer Proceedings, have been downloaded more than 2,800,000  times so far, supports the robust impact of the event among the scholars of AI internationally.. …[read more]

  Call for Papers    

 The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.  
  Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

  Submission Instructions  
 Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org  for any questions regarding the submissions.  
  
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE   Paper Formatting   
 Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template (available here  ). All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:  
 Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission. 
  Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past. 
  Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years. 
  PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.  
 Anonymous Submissions   
  
 ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.  
 Double and Concurrent Submissions   
 Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.  
 Ethical Considerations   
 The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.  
 Early Rejection and Appeals   
 There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 Paper Revision and Resubmission   
 Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2. A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.  
 Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation   
 If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.  
 Contact  
 For any questions related to paper submissions, please contact the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org  .

 IFIP AIAI Community  

 Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations (AIAI conference) started from Toulouse France.   
 Today, its society comprises of hundreds AI experts-enthusiasts, academicians and researchers from all over the globe (Europe, Asia, America and Australia). They are interacting by presenting their scientific achievements or by discussing numerous aspects of AI advances, under the 4th industrial revolution.  
  The AIAI conference now has its own society, consisting of followers who have been attending it for one or two decades in the row, while new members are constantly joining its family.  
  After almost two decades of continuous presence in the literature, the members of the AIAI society, have formed a very strong community under the auspices of the IFIP Working Group 12.5 (AI applications and Innovations). This group is divided in specific scientific subgroups-subcommunities, specializing in timely hot AI areas. Their members are organizing timely annual workshops specific by subject, which are run and attended by AI professionals-scientists who wish to share knowledge, ideas, problems and insights in every AI subdomain.  

 An indicative reference to the communities – societies that have been already formed under the auspices of the AIAI conference, would include (but not limited) the following:  

 • The Community of Mining Humanistic Data (driven by the Ionian University and the University of Patras, Greece).  
  • The Community of 5G technologies putting intelligence in the network’s Edge (driven by the Hellenic Telecommunication Organization (TO) and other European Union TOs.  
  • The Community of Cybersecurity innovations and Applications driven by the European Defense Agency (the European Union Security Organization).  
  • The Community of AI and Ethics (driven by Professor John Macintyre from the University of Sunderland UK, Professor Mathhias Scheutz, Tufts School of AS and other colleagues from the USA.  

 Though the above communities are here to stay, the above list is dynamic, as new Communities devoted to new AI subdomains are joining to this global event every year.  
  Apart from the papers’ presentation, the distinguished members of the AIAI (IFIP WG12.5) society are offering new insights by giving free Tutorials to conference delegates. This adds actual more merit to the event and enhances the benefits of the members of the AIAI community  
  One of the many benefits for the members of these subcommunities is the fact that they bring together scientists, who are interested either in a narrow specific domain or in hot multidisciplinary areas, or in an emerging subject. This can lead to increased connection and awareness of developments.  
  Under the framework of this community, new researchers are encouraged to proceed further to their developments, by receiving best papers awards together with financial awards, or checks provided by Springer to offer them free access to important scientific publications. Moreover, under the guise of noble rivalry, old and young researchers are invited to complete their research and submit their extended paper for review in prestigious scientific journals. Especially for the young researchers of the AIAI community, this is a unique opportunity to publish not only in the springer proceedings which have millions of recent citations, but also in major scientific journals with a high citation rate.

  About ArtsIT 2023   
 The ArtsIT conference brings together a wide array of cross-/inter-/trans-disciplinary researchers, practitioners, artists, and academia to present and discuss the symbiosis between art (in its widest definition) and information technology applied in a variety of distinct fields. Since 2009 ArtsIT has become acknowledged as a leading scientific forum for the dissemination of cutting-edge research results in the intersection between art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. The role of artistic practice using digital media is also to serve as a tool for analysis and critical reflection on how technologies influence our lives, culture, and society. ArtsIT is therefore not only a place to discuss technological progress but also a place to reflect on the impact of art and technology on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. Besides the main track, the event also focuses on the advances seen in diverse areas that have significantly contributed to the field in the last years, namely, Digital Musical Interfaces, virtualization and artificial intelligence with special sessions.  
 Campinas is a Brazilian city located in the southeast region of São Paulo State and is situated a few kilometers from the Tropic of Capricorn, which crosses São Paulo State. It is the first Brazilian city to become a metropolis without being a capital, exerting significant national influence. The city is home to several universities, including UNICAMP, the State University of Campinas, ranked among the top five universities in Latin America. In only 57 years, this university has achieved international recognition by fulfilling its mission of building and disseminating knowledge and innovation.  
 This year, ArtsIT is hosted by NICS, the Interdisciplinary Nucleus of Sound Studies, as part of its 40th anniversary. Formed in 1983, NICS’ primary objective is to research different manifestations of sound, in all its aspects and applications, as a source of informational, cognitive, and creative content. The nucleus was founded with a vocation for interdisciplinary research, addressing innovative themes for the time that continue to be updated, including sound pollution, analysis of sounds in Brazilian forests, phonetics of their fauna and native populations, electronic music, and ethnomusicological records.

  Call For Papers   
   
 The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning. Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected. Submission Instructions Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org for any questions regarding the submissions. SUBMISSION SITE TO BE CONFIRMED Paper Formatting Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template (available here). All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Conflicts of Interest When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include: Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission. Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past. Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years. PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected. Anonymous Submissions ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Double and Concurrent Submissions Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors. Ethical Considerations The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns. Early Rejection and Appeals There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection. Paper Revision and Resubmission Rejected papers in the 1st round cannot be resubmitted in the 2nd round. A small number of the 1st round submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances. Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one paper author must register for each accepted paper at the appropriate full conference rate.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-11-24

 Authors must submit full-length, double-columned, original papers, with a maximum of 6 pages in PDF format (including the abstract, figures and tables) and are recommended to format their papers based on the ACM template. One page of references is allowed, which does not count towards the 6-page limitation. ASP-DAC does not allow double and/or parallel submissions of similar work to any other conferences, symposia, and journals. The submission must not include information that serves to identify the authors of the manuscript, such as name(s) or affiliation(s) of the author(s), anywhere in the manuscript, abstract, references and bibliographic citations. While research papers with open-source software are highly encouraged where the software will be made publicly available (via GitHub or similar), the authors’ identities need to be anonymized in the submitted paper for the double-blind review process. Issuing the paper as a technical report, posting the paper on a website, or presenting the paper at a workshop that does not publish formally reviewed proceedings, does not disqualify it from appearing in the proceedings. Submissions of pre-print papers, e.g., published on arXiv, are also allowed in ASP-DAC 2025. However, that the authors are expected to follow all reasonable efforts to ensure that the submission is compliant with the double-blind review process. Note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one different conference registration at the speaker’s registration rate. ACM and IEEE reserve the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference by any author.  
 Submission of Papers:   
  Deadline for Abstract submission: 5 PM AOE (Anywhere on earth) July 5 (Fri), 2024   
  Deadline for PDF uploading: 5 PM AOE (Anywhere on earth) July 12 (Fri), 2024

 Goals:  The Australian Bioinformatics And Computational Biology Society (ABACBS, pron.ˈabəkəs) is focused on the science and profession of bioinformatics and computational biology in Australia.  
   
  ABACBS aims to  
  1. strengthen the science and profession  
  2. encourage and support students  
  3. provide representation and advocacy  
  4. promote interaction and awareness  
   
  of bioinformatics and computational biology.  
   
  The vision of ABACBS is  
  1. for people to understand why bioinformatics and computational biology are important  
  2. for excellence in the science and profession of bioinformatics and computational biology  
  3. for good career opportunities in bioinformatics and computational biology.  
   
  ABACBS has emerged from broad consultation with the Australian bioinformatics and computational biology community, initiated by the Australian Bioinformatics Network in 2013. It was felt that there was a high level of support for a professional society representing Australian bioinformaticians and computational biologists. The Society was incorporated in November 2014, and the first executive committee was formed. The first national annual ABACBS conference was held in Sydney in 2015. ABACBS is a young society with an exciting future. We are keen to pursue opportunities for an annual conference as well as support special interest groups.

 Over the last two decades the field of Intelligent Systems delivered to human kind significant achievements, while also facing major transformations. 20 years ago, automation and knowledge-based AI were still the dominant paradigms fueling the efforts of both researchers and practitioners. Later, 10 years ago, statistical machine intelligence was on the rise, heavily supported by the digital computing, and led to the unprecedented advances in and dependence on digital technology. However, the resultant intelligent systems remained designer-based endeavors and thus, were limited in their true learning and development abilities. Today, the challenge is to have in place intelligent systems that can develop themselves on behalf of their creators, and gain abilities with no or limited supervision in the tasks they are meant to perform. Cognitive development systems, and the supporting cognitive computing are on the rise today, promising yet other significant achievements for the future of human kind. This book captures this unprecedented evolution of the field of intelligent systems, presenting a compilation of studies that covers all research directions in the field over the last two decades, offering to the reader a broad view over the field, while providing a solid foundation from which outstanding new ideas may emerge.

 An Evolutionary Optimization Approach for Path Planning of Arrival Aircraft for Optimal Sequencing    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.1-16 

 In this paper, we present an evolutionary optimization based path planning algorithm at Terminal Airspace (TAS) that provides a near optimal aircraft arrival sequence at Final Approach Fix (FAF). The sequence obtained minimizes the inter-arrival time as well as provides conflict free path planning to an Air Traffic Controller (ATC). A classic Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization technique with conflict detection and resolution is developed. Conflict between any two aircraft is detected based on their future arrival time at the waypoint and resolved by stretching the gap between those two aircraft. The proposed algorithm is compared with the traditional GA. Results indicate that the proposed approach obtains a near optimal solution compared to the traditional GA based algorithm which does not consider TAS constraints.   

 A Game-Theoretic Approach to the Analysis of Traffic Assignment    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.17-30 

 In order to improve the cooperation between traffic management and travellers, traffic assignment is the key component. In terms of the traffic assignment, it can be classified into two models based on the behavior assumption governing route choices: the User Equilibrium (UE) and System Optimum (SO) traffic assignment. By the definition of UE and SO traffic assignment, traffic users usually competitively choose the least cost routes to minimize their own travel cost, while system optimum traffic assignment requires traffic users work cooperatively to minimize overall cost in road network. Thus, the paradox of benefits between UE and SO makes both of them are not practical. Thus, a solution technique needs to be proposed to balance between UE and SO models, which can compromise both sides and give more feasible traffic assignments. In this paper, Stackelberg game theory is introduced to the traffic assignment, which can achieve the trade-off process between traffic management and travellers. Since the traditional traffic assignments have low convergence rates, the gradient projection algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of the traffic assignment.

  pp.31-43 

 Until nowadays, the scientific community firmly rejected the Theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, a theory mostly associated with the name of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1774–1829). Though largely dismissed when applied to biological organisms, this theory found its place in a young discipline called Artificial Life. Based on the two models of Darwinian and Lamarckian evolutionary theories built using neural networks and genetic algorithms, this research presents a notion of the potential impact of implementation of Lamarckian knowledge inheritance across disciplines, including biology, computer science and philosophy. There is an evidence that Lamarckian organisms can have wide practical application across several different domains, therefore this type of research should be allowed and encouraged. However, even though Lamarckian evolutionary algorithm already holds major benefits for various disciplines and promises even more, its implementation in Artificial Life needs regulation to avoid malevolent use.   

 A Local Search Algorithm for Saving Energy Cost in Duty-Cycle Wireless Sensor Network    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.45-59 

 Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been recently used for various applications. Due to the distributed and (often) unattended nature of the nodes after deployment, the lack of energy and the interruptive process in each sensor are the two major problems of WSN systems. Hence, designing a protocol which not only improves system performance but also lowers sensors’ energy consumption so as to maximize the network lifetime is very much desirable. The network lifetime maximization problem was known to be NP-Hard. This paper addresses the Minimum Energy-Multicasting (MEM) problem in Duty-Cycle Wireless Sensor Networks (DC-WSNs) in which sensors cyclically switch between on/off (wake/sleep) modes. To that end, we propose a local search algorithm and compare its performance with the best algorithm so far called GS-MEM over the four datasets designated for the MEM problem. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms GS-MEM in terms of energy cost.

 Obstacle Avoidance for Multi-agent Path Planning Based on Vectorized Particle Swarm Optimization    
   
 Full-text available    
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.61-74 

 This paper deals with an approach to path planning by obstacle avoidance for multi-agent systems. An effective framework is presented based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method; an evolutionary computation (EC) technique that uses the dynamics of the swarm to search the solutions for the optimization problems. It describes the path replanning technique and obstacle avoidance for autonomous multi-agent systems. A simultaneous replanning concept is incorporated into the path planning to avoid both static and dynamic obstacles. This proposed algorithm reduces the computational time of the path planning. In the dynamic environment, the numerical results show that the Simultaneous Replanning Vectorized Particle Swarm Optimization (SRVPSO) algorithm is effective and also efficient for multi-agent systems.   

 Resource Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling: A Priority Rule Based Evolutionary Local Search Approach    
   
 Full-text available    
 Chapter    

 Nov 2016 
  Proceedings in Adaptation, Learning and Optimization 

 This paper considers a static resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem (RCMPSP) with two lateness objectives: project lateness and portfolio lateness. To solve the RCMPSP, we have proposed an evolutionary local search heuristic that uses a variable neighborhood (ELSH-VN) approach. The heuristic is further analyzed by incorporating different priority-rules. To judge the performance of these priority rule based heuristics, an extensive simulation-based analysis has been conducted with different scenario-based schedules. For the experimental study, we have considered a standard set of 77 generated RCMPSP test instances of 20 activities. The experimental analysis indicates that the proposed heuristic is able to solve multiple projects with reasonable computational burden. The influence of the variation of resource distribution and resource contention on the algorithm’s performance for different priority rules is also analyzed and discussed.   

 Genetic Programming with Embedded Feature Construction for High-Dimensional Symbolic Regression    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.87-102 

 Feature construction is an effective way to eliminate the limitation of poor data representation in many tasks such as high-dimensional symbolic regression. Genetic Programming (GP) is a good choice for feature construction for its natural ability to explore the feature space to detect and combine important features. However, there is very little contribution devoted to enhance the generalisation performance of GP for high-dimensional symbolic regression by feature construction. This work aims to develop a new feature construction method namely genetic programming with embedded feature construction (GPEFC) for high-dimensional symbolic regression. GPEFC keeps track of new small informative building blocks on best fitness gain individuals and constructs new features using these building blocks. The new constructed features augment the Terminal Set of GP dynamically. A series of experiments were conducted to investigate the learning ability and generalisation performance of GPEFC. The results show that GPEFC can evolve more compact models in an efficient way, has better learning ability and better generalisation performance than standard GP.

 The Convolutional Neural Network Model Based on an Evolutionary Approach For Interactive Picture Book    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.103-116 

 Creating interactive picture books based on human “Kansei” is one of the most interesting and difficult issues in the artificial intelligence field. We have proposed a novel interactive picture book based on Pictgent (Picture Information Shared Conversation Agent) and CASOOK (Creative Animating Sketchbook). Since our system accepts human sketches instead of natural languages, a high degree of sketch recognition accuracy is required. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to various image- recognition tasks successfully. We have also adopted a CNN model for the sketch recognition of the proposed interactive picture book. However, it takes a considerable effort to tune the hyperparameters of a CNN. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter tuning method for CNNs using an evolutionary approach. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by a computer simulation that uses, as an example, a scribble-object recognition problem for the interactive picture book.

 Semi-automatic Picture Book Generation Based on Story Model and Agent-Based Simulation    
   
 Chapter

  pp.117-132 

 In the fields of artificial intelligence, automatic narrative generation has attracted considerable interest. Lots of studies on narrative generation have been reported. However, most of those do not consider stories and representation mediums separately. In this study, we focus on the picture book as the narrative because picture book is a mix of images and language. As a first step of automatic story generation without representation mediums, we propose a novel semi-automatic picture book generation method based on story model and agent-based simulation. The computational experiments are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

 In this paper, we present a new Memetic Algorithm for overlapping community detection. We use a link-based clustering approach to detect the communities of edges in complex networks. To assess the quality of our method, we present experimental results for benchmark networks in comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, we present a case study of a co-purchasing product network from a brand-centric point of view to show the real-life utility of this new Memetic Algorithm.   

 Analysis of Parameter-Less Population Pyramid on the Local Distribution of Inferior Individuals    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.149-164 

 Unlike many GAs, the Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) is an optimization model that avoids premature convergence due to the pyramid-like structure of populations, and thus P3 can be applied to a wide range of problems without parameter tuning. However, in some problems, P3 cannot control the number of fitness evaluations in local search and in crossover, while adapting problem structures. Meanwhile, we have proposed a novel technique, called DII analysis. The computational complexity of applied problems can be estimated based on the number of local optima according to the results obtained using DII. In order to solve the problem of P3, we also have proposed combining P3 with DII analysis (P3-DII). In this study, we investigated the effect of DII analysis on balance between genetic operators. The performance of P3-DII was confirmed according to the computational experiments which were carried out taking several combinational problems as examples.   

 Integrating Class Information and Features in Cluster Analysis Based on Evolutionary Distance Metric Learning

  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.165-181 

 Most current applications of clustering only focus on a technological domain, e.g., numerical similarity, while overlooking human domain yield unnatural and incomprehensible results in a human point of view. Unsupervised clustering constructs based on the similarities of numerical features. This study decreases the gap between multiple disciplines that are concerned both computational artifact and the human understanding in order to construct a more understandable cluster structure by considering available class information as well as data features in the clustering. Hence, we applied Evolutionary Distance Metric Learning (EDML) in cluster analysis in order to simultaneously analyze both class label and features. This method is applied to the real-world problem of facial images and food recipes data. The analysis provided promising insights about the relation between class information and features of the data, overall cluster structure distribution, neighbor cluster relations, and the viewpoint of the cluster analysis. Finally, cluster analysis using EDML method can obtain a more intelligible cluster structure with neighbor relations, discover interesting insights, and particular cluster structure can be obtained according to the purpose of analysis. Precisely, these results cannot be achieved by unsupervised clustering.   

 Multiple Additional Sampling by Expected Improvement Maximization in Efficient Global Optimization for Real-World Design Problems    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2016 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.183-194 

 Efficient global optimization (EGO), based on the expected improvement maximization of the Kriging model, is a suitable optimization method for designs based on time-consuming evaluations such as computational fluid dynamics. However, the original formulation of EGO can find only one additional sample point after an initial sample point is acquired for the initial Kriging model construction. Therefore, the efficiency of EGO is decreased even if the designer is able to evaluate several designs using a large parallel computer because additional samples can only be obtained sequentially through the additional sampling process. In this study, a multiple additional sampling method is proposed to improve the efficiency of the additional sampling process in EGO while maintaining the performance of exploration based on EI maximization. The design performance of EGO with MAS is investigated by solving a test problem first, and then an airfoil design problem, which is a single objective problem. The results are compared with the original EGO in terms of the convergence of the objective function and the diversity of the design variables. According to these problems, the proposed method acquires optimum solutions as effectively as the original EGO, while the diversity of the solutions is improved. In addition, the total design time can be reduced compared with the original EGO in a parallel computational environment.   

 Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling Under Uncertainty Using Genetic Programming

  pp.195-210 

 Job shop scheduling (JSS) is a hard problem with most of the research focused on scenarios with the assumption that the shop parameters such as processing times, due dates are constant. But in the real world uncertainty in such parameters is a major issue. In this work, we investigate a genetic programming based hyper-heuristic approach to evolving dispatching rules suitable for dynamic job shop scheduling under uncertainty. We consider uncertainty in processing times and consider multiple job types pertaining to different levels of uncertainty. In particular, we propose an approach to use exponential moving average of the deviations of the processing times in the dispatching rules. We test the performance of the proposed approach under different uncertain scenarios. Our results show that the proposed method performs significantly better for a wide range of uncertain scenarios.

 On Deriving a Relationship Between Complexity and Fidelity in Rule Based Multi-agent Systems    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.223-235 

 Understanding the relationship between model complexity and fidelity in simulations is particularly important as increased complexity is one of the major cost drivers of any simulation. In this work we explore the relationship between complexity and fidelity in simple rule based multi-agent systems by employing a multi-objective evolutionary framework in two problem domains: (1) Simulation of conversational group dynamics (2) Simulation of sheepdog herding dynamics. Firstly, a new complexity measure is introduced to characterise complexity of the multi-agent systems. Thereafter the interplay between complexity and fidelity is analysed and the relationship is derived empirically by fitting the obtained data into functions that can describe the relationship in a compact and meaningful manner. This empirical study will be useful to develop theoretical understandings of the complexity and fidelity trade-off in multi-agent based simulations and the approach may be generalised to other simulation types.   

 Feature Construction Using Genetic Programming for Figure-Ground Image Segmentation    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.237-250 

 Figure-ground segmentation is a process of separating regions of interest from unimportant backgrounds. For complex images (e.g. images with high variations), feature construction (FC) is necessary, which can produce high-level features, to help achieve accurate segmentation performance. Genetic programming (GP) is considered as a well-suited FC technique, which is employed for the first time to build FC methods that aim to improve the segmentation performance in this paper. One filter GP method (FGP), in which a novel entropy based fitness function is developed, and one embedded GP method (EGP), in which the error rate is used as the fitness function, are proposed. The single constructed feature and the combined features (the constructed feature + original features) are tested on two standard image datasets with high variations, i.e. Weizmann and Pascal datasets. Compared with the original features extracted by existing feature descriptors, both methods can construct useful features from the original ones with the combined features improving the segmentation performance on both datasets generally. Moreover, EGP is more efficient and perform better than FGP.   

 Estimation of Distribution Algorithms with Graph Kernels for Graphs with Node Types

  pp.251-261 

 We have proposed a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms with graph kernels (EDA-GK). By using the graph kernels, we can search for solutions in a feature space. The use of the graph kernel can eliminate the effect of the ruggedness of genotype-phenotype mappings of evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we extend the EDA-GK to cope with graphs with node types. In order to achieve this, the histogram in the kernel density estimation function is separated into several sub-histograms for modes of inter-types, and for nodes of each type. Experimental results on the Edge-Max problems show the effectiveness of the proposed method.   

 Generating Hub-Spoke Network for Public Transportation: Comparison Between Genetic Algorithm and Cuckoo Search Algorithm

  pp.263-275 

 Scheduled transportation service is a proper system for mass transportation and it is adopted by wide range of transportation modes, such as railway, airline, maritime container shipping and bus. The providers of the service are required to organize effective routes and networks. This paper tackles the problem combining two problems. One is generating Public Transit Network (PTN) as one of the scheduled transportation services. The other is network hub location problem to find out the effective position of the node as a hub station. The method generating PTN is based on a growing network model and the method for the hub location problem is based on a genetic algorithm and a cuckoo search algorithm. This method can find out effective position of the hub node and transportation line network simultaneously. In this framework, this paper reports the comparison result between the genetic algorithm and the cuckoo search algorithm for the hub location problem.   

 Randomising Block Sizes for BlockCopy-Based Wind Farm Layout Optimisation    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.277-289 

 The BlockCopy stochastic local search algorithm is a state-of-the-art optimiser for the Wind Farm Layout Optimisation problem. Unlike many other metaheuristics-based optimisers, BlockCopy requires the specification of only one key parameter, namely a block size. In this paper, we investigate the effect on different block sizes on the optimisation results. Using standard benchmarks for the Wind Farm Layout Optimisation problem, we show that smaller fixed block sizes (relative to overall layout size) produce better optimised layouts than larger fixed block sizes. More interestingly, we also show that randomising the block size parameter results in optimisation performance at the same or a better level than that produced by the best algorithm with a fixed block size. Effectively, this means that the user can ignore the need to tune the block size parameter and simply randomise it instead. Such a strategy results in what is effectively a parameterless, but none-the-less effective, optimisation algorithm for the Wind Farm Layout Optimisation problem.

  pp.291-304 

 This paper focuses on the Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) and proposes the efficient aircraft landing route and order optimization method compared to the conventional method. As a difficulty in solving ALP, both landing route and order of all aircrafts should be optimized together, meaning that they cannot be optimized independently. To tackle this problem, our method employs novelty search to generate variety candidates of aircraft landing routes, which are indispensable to generate the feasible landing order of all aircraft. Through the experiment on a benchmark problem, it has revealed that the proposed method can reduce the occupancy time of aircrafts in an airport.

 This paper aims to reveal design strategies of a sounding hybrid rocket to efficiently perform extinction-reignition. On previous studies, we have derived design candidates which each is a solution optimized on a design optimization problem for the sounding hybrid rocket. To extract design strategies from the design candidates, this paper applies an evolutionary mining system to design candidates, considered as a knowledge discovery task. Specifically, we introduce an evolutionary rule-based data mining system for analyzing a set of Pareto optimal solutions. Our system acquires rules indicating local design information and also we intuitively discover anomalous design strategies.   

 A Novel Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Its Applications on Knapsack and Feature Selection Problems    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2017 
  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.319-332 

 Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is a well-known evolutionary computation technique, which has been applied to solve many optimisation problems. There are two main types of PSO, which are continuous PSO (CPSO) and binary PSO (BPSO). Since PSO is originally proposed to address continuous problems, CPSO has been studied extensively while there are only a few studies about BPSO. In a standard PSO algorithm, momentum is an important component, which preserves the swarm’s diversity. However, since movements in binary search spaces and continuous search spaces are different, it is not appropriate to apply directly the momentum concept of CPSO to BPSO. This paper introduces a new momentum concept to BPSO, which leads to a novel BPSO algorithm, named SBPSO. SBPSO is compared with a recent BPSO algorithm, named PBPSO, in two well-known binary problems: knapsack and feature selection. The experimental results on knapsack datasets show that SBPSO can find better solutions than PBPSO. In feature selection problems, SBPSO can select a smaller number of features and still achieve similar or better accuracies than PBPSO and using all the original features in a comparative computation time.

 Trucks play a significant role in transporting containers between the seaside and storage yard at a container terminal. This paper exhibits a cooperative strategy for scheduling trucks, which allows trucks working or acting together toward a common purpose that can reduce truck-unload rate and cut back the make span. The objective is to minimize the total time cost of the sum of the delay of requests and the travel time of yard trucks. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and three of its variants are applied to deal with the scheduling problem. The effectiveness of PSOs are analyzed by four typical different level-scale test problems. The results demonstrate that social learning PSO (SLPSO) can obtain better results than other algorithms for different scale cases.

 A global industrial enterprise is a complex network of different distributed production plants that produce, inventory, and distribute products. An agent-based model can be used to solve complex network problems that involve independent actors. The global economy and the increase in both demand fluctuation and pressure to lower costs while satisfying customers have put a premium on smart supply chain management. It is important to undertake a risk benefit analysis of supply chain design alternatives before making decisions. Simulation is an effective approach to comparative analysis and evaluation of such alternatives. In this paper, we describe an agent-based simulation tool for the design of smart supply chain networks and logistics networks. In the agent-based approach, supply chain models comprise supply chain agents. The agent-based simulation tool is useful to predict the effects of local and system-level activities on multi-plant performance and to improve the tactical and strategic decision-making at the enterprise level. Specifically, this model can reveal the optimal transport method under demand fluctuation and network disruption conditions. We found that selecting transport methods according to maximum stock is effective and can reduce cut the amount of stock in the whole supply chain in Thailand.

 Perceptual Crossing experiment is the method for analyzing human interaction with low degrees of freedom of perception and motion. In this experiment, participants need to establish a cooperative interaction to achieve a task. In this study, we introduce time delays of participant’s perception in this experiment, and evaluate the stability of human social interaction against the time delay. Our result shows that human social interactions have the stability against the time delays by changing their behaviors adaptively. We also investigate if the stability can be enhanced by modulating the participant’s behavior conversely. It is shown that it is possible to increase the stability of social interaction by slowing down behaviors of participants.

 Multiple Imputation and Ensemble Learning for Classification with Incomplete Data    
   
 Chapter

  Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems 
  pp.401-415 

 Missing values are a common issue in many real-world datasets, and therefore coping with such datasets is an essential requirement of classification since inadequate treatment of missing values often leads to large classification errors. One of the most popular ways to address incomplete data is to use imputation methods to fill missing fields with plausible values. Multiple imputation, which fills each missing field with a set of plausible values, is a powerful approach to dealing with incomplete data, but is mainly used for statistical analysis. Ensemble learning which constructs a set of classifiers instead of one classifier has proven capable of improving classification accuracy, but has been mainly applied to complete data. This paper proposes a combination of multiple imputation and ensemble learning to build an ensemble of classifiers for incomplete data classification tasks. A multiple imputation method is used to generate a set of diverse imputed datasets which is then used to build a set of diverse classifiers. Experiments on ten benchmark datasets use a decision tree as classification algorithm and compare the proposed approach with two other popular approaches to dealing with incomplete data. The results show that, in almost all cases, the proposed method achieves significantly better classification accuracy than the other methods .

 An Evolutionary Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Google Machine Reassignment Problem

  pp.431-442 

 Google Machine Reassignment Problem (GMRP) is a real world problem proposed at ROADEF/EURO challenge 2012 competition which must be solved within 5 min. GMRP consists in reassigning a set of services into a set of machines for which the aim is to improve the machine usage while satisfying numerous constraints. This paper proposes an evolutionary simulated annealing (ESA) algorithm for solving this problem. Simulated annealing (SA) is a single solution based heuristic, which has been successfully used in various optimisation problems. The proposed ESA uses a population of solutions instead of a single solution. Each solution has its own SA algorithm and all SAs work in parallel manner. Each SA starts with different initial solution which can lead to a different search path with distinct local optima. In addition, mutation operators are applied once the solution cannot be improved for a certain number of iterations. This will not only help the search avoid being trapped in a local optima, but also reduce computation time. Because new solutions are not generated from scratch but based on existing ones. This study shows that the proposed ESA method can outperform state of the art algorithms on GMRP.   

 Mobile Agent Based Obstacle Avoidance in Multi-robot Hunting    
   
 Chapter

  pp.443-452 

 Multi-robot hunting is a problem in which multiple robots cooperatively search for a target that emits signals in the all directions. Robots proceed in the guidance of the signals, and finally, some of them reach the target to capture. In order to solve the problem, an approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which is one of meta-heuristics, has been proposed. The PSO based approach is well known that it works well in fields with no obstacle. It is, however, not assumed to be used in practical situations with obstacles. In order to lift this restriction, we propose a new PSO based approach that enables particles search and capture the target while getting around the obstacles. In our approach, each robot records its moving trace in a fixed period. Once a robot is blocked by obstacles and cannot proceed, it creates a mobile software agent that migrates to other robots around it through Wi-Fi. The mobile software agent selectively migrates to some robots whose traces have some intersection points. Since a sequence of the traces gives a detour route through which a robot can go, the agent can just inform the detour route to its home robot. We have implemented a simulator based on our approach, and conducted experiments. The experimental results show that our approach is remarkably more effective than the original PSO based approach.

 This paper introduces a reinforcement learning technique with an internal reward for a multi-agent cooperation task. The proposed method is an extension of Q-learning which changes the ordinary (external) reward to the internal reward for agent-cooperation under the condition of no communication. To increase the certainty of the proposed methods, we theoretically investigate what values should be set to select the goal for the cooperation among agents. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct the intensive simulation on the maze problem for the agent-cooperation task, and confirm the following implications: (1) the proposed method successfully enable agents to acquire cooperative behaviors while a conventional method fails to always acquire such behaviors; (2) the cooperation among agents according to their internal rewards is achieved no communication; and (3) the condition for the cooperation among any number of agent is indicated.   

 Autonomous Task Allocation for Swarm Robotic Systems Using Behavioral Decomposition

  pp.469-481 

 Swarm robotic systems (SRS) are a type of multi-robot systems, in which robots operate without any form of centralized control. In SRS, the generation of a complex swarm behavior resulting in robots being dynamically distributed over different sub-tasks requires an autonomous task allocation mechanism. It has been well recognized that evolutionary robotics with an evolving artificial neural network is a promising approach for generating collective swarm behavior. However, the artificial evolution often suffers from the bootstrap problem, especially when the underlying task is very complex. On the other hand, the behavioral decomposition, which is based on the divide-and-conquer thinking, has been reported to be effective for overcoming the bootstrap problem. In this paper, we describe how a behavioral decomposition based evolutionary robotics approach can be applied to synthesize a composite artificial neural network based controller for a complex task. The simulation results show the hierarchical strategy based evolutionary robotics approach is effective for generating autonomous task allocation behavior for a swarm robotic system.

 Fully anticipating the overall effect on society is difficult due to the many as-yet-unrecognized factors at disaster sites. There is a need for autonomous disaster relief robots, which can learn from the conditions they encounter and then take independent actions. Reinforcement learning is one way that robots can acquire information about appropriate behavior in new environments. In the present study, we present the results of a disaster relief simulation that included multiple autonomous robots working as a multi-agent system. In order to assist in the use of reinforcement learning for the efficient acquisition of action rules, we divided the task into various sub-tasks. We propose an approach in which cooperative action is obtained by giving each agent a different reward; this encourages the agents to play different roles. We investigated how the various autonomous agents determined the appropriate action rules and examined the influence of providing separate rewards to different agents in the system. We also compared the values of various actions in different learning situations.   

 An Evolutionary framework for the Bi-Objectives Dynamic Economic and Environmental Dispatch Problems    
   
 Chapter    

 Nov 2016 
  Proceedings in Adaptation, Learning and Optimization 

 A dynamic economic and environmental dispatch (DEED) problem is a challenging bi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes both operating costs and gas emissions. To solve it, several evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been used, each of which has pros and cons, with one performing better in an early stage of evolution and another later. In this paper, to solve such problems, an evolutionary framework is designed based on two EAs, a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE), dynamically configures the better of the two during the evolution. In it, two sub-populations are performed, one for each of GA and DE, and their sizes updated in each generation according to the respective algorithm’s performance in previous generations. Moreover, a heuristic is employed to improve the performance of the proposed algorithm by repairing infeasible individuals towards feasible directions. To demonstrate its performance, two renewable-based DEED problems are solved using the proposed and state-of-the-art algorithms. An analysis of the simulation results reveals that the proposed algorithm is the best of those considered, with the heuristic enhancing its performances.

 The computer-aided language teaching system is maturing thanks to the advancement of few-shot learning technologies. In order to support teachers and increase students’ learning efficiency, more computer-aided language teaching systems are being used in teaching and examinations. This study focuses on a multifeature fusion-based evaluation method for oral English learning, completely evaluating specific grammar, and assisting oral learners in improving their oral pronunciation skills. This study proposes an improved method based on HMM a posteriori probability scoring, in which the only standard reference model is no longer used as the basis for scoring and error determination, and instead, the average level of standard pronunciation in the entire corpus is introduced as another judgment basis, based on a preliminary study of speech recognition technology, scoring methods, and relevant theoretical knowledge of information feedback. This strategy can reduce the score limitation caused by standard pronunciation personal differences, lower the system’s misjudgment rate in detecting pronunciation errors, and improve the usefulness of error correction information. An expert opinion database has been created based on the most prevalent forms of spoken pronunciation problems, which can successfully assist learners improve their spoken English level by combining the database’s corrected information. Finally, this study proposes an artificial scoring system for spoken English that performs activities such as identification, scoring, error judgment, and correction opinion feedback, among others. Finally, it has been demonstrated through trials and tests that adding the average pronunciation level to the system improves the system’s scoring performance and has a certain effect on increasing users’ oral pronunciation level.

  The long-term goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to make machines learn and think like human beings. Due to the high levels of uncertainty and vulnerability in human life and the open-ended nature of problems that humans are facing, no matter how intelligent machines are, they are unable to completely replace humans. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce human cognitive capabilities or ... [Show full abstract]  human-like cognitive models into AI systems to develop a new form of AI, that is, hybrid-augmented intelligence. This form of AI or machine intelligence is a feasible and important developing model. Hybrid-augmented intelligence can be divided into two basic models: one is human-in-the-loop augmented intelligence with human-computer collaboration, and the other is cognitive computing based augmented intelligence, in which a cognitive model is embedded in the machine learning system. This survey describes a basic framework for human-computer collaborative hybrid-augmented intelligence, and the basic elements of hybrid-augmented intelligence based on cognitive computing. These elements include intuitive reasoning, causal models, evolution of memory and knowledge, especially the role and basic principles of intuitive reasoning for complex problem solving, and the cognitive learning framework for visual scene understanding based on memory and reasoning. Several typical applications of hybrid-augmented intelligence in related fields are given.

  We propose a novel metric called MetrIntMeas (Metric for the Intelligence Measuring) for an accurate and robust measurement of the difficult problem-solving intelligence of a swarm system. The metric allows the classification if a swarm system belongs to the same class with the systems which have a specific reference intelligence value. For proving the efficiency of the proposed metric we ... [Show full abstract]  realized a case study on a swarm system specialized in solving a NP-hard problem. As an application of the proposed metric, we present the measurement of the swarm systems’ evolution in intelligence. We gave a new definition to the intelligent evolving systems.

  The increased intelligence of a computing system could allow more efficient and/or flexible and/or accurate solving of problems with different difficulties like: NP-hard problems, problems that have missing or erroneous data etc. We consider that even if there is no unanimous definition of the systems’ intelligence, the machine intelligence could be measured. In our research, we will understand ... [Show full abstract]  by intelligent systems the intelligent cooperative multiagent systems (CMASs). Even in a CMAS composed of simple agents an increased intelligence emerges many times at the system’s level. We propose a novel method called OutIntSys for the detection of the systems which has a statistically extremely low and extremely high intelligence, called systems with outlier intelligence, from a set of intelligent systems that solves the same type(s) of problems. The proposed method has practical applicability in choosing of the most intelligent CMASs from a set of CMASs in solving difficult problems. To prove the effectiveness of the OutIntSys method we realized a study that included six intelligent CMASs with similar type of operation, composed of simple computing agents specialized in solving a difficult NP-hard problem. OutIntSys does not detect any outlier intelligence. It detected just CMASs whose MIQ is further from the rest but that cannot be considered as outliers. This was expectable based on the fact that the CMASs operation was very similar. We performed a comparison with two recent metrics for measuring the machine intelligence presented in the scientific literature.

  A fuzzy mechanism for building a goal-driven, life-purpose perspective for artificial intelligence, robotics or computational intelligence is presented in this paper. According to a non-traditional epistemological paradigm for understanding the term intelligence this adaptive fuzzy goal-driven approach becomes an alternative both to construct intelligent systems and to understand human ...

The fuzzy system as suggested may yet be seen as a useful mechanism for representing the approximate human-being reasoning due the likelihood it presents when compared to the way human beings adapt their reasoning and behavior in order to accommodate small changes caused by the environment or by the context. In this sense the proposed approach may also allow the nature of intelligent machine and intelligent human behavior converge to be the same.

Since the industrial revolution [1], science and mechanization have become central to many academic challenges, driving a paradigm shift from philosophy towards systems engineering techniques. This desire to improve mechanized systems created the need for improvements to automation processes. These achievements extend the pioneering efforts of others stimulating new research and developments [2]. Computational Intelligence(CI) has evolved over the past 60 years [3] with many new fields of study emerging to dissolve obstacles encountered. These attempts relate to efforts at personifying attributes of human behavior and knowledge processes within machines. The resulting Machine Intelligence [4,5] efforts stimulated the study of Artificial Intelligence(AI) [6,7] and led to the evolution of many contemporary techniques.
