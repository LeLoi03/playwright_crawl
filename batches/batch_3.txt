 Binary Logarithm and Antilogarithm Calculations Using Uniformly Segmented Linear Regression   
 Dat Ngo, Korea National University of Transportation, South Korea  
 ABSTRACT   
 Digital signal processing (DSP) applications fundamentally rely on arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and division. These operations present significant challenges when implemented on resource-constrained edge devices due to their complexity and high computational demands. The logarithmic number system offers a promising solution to mitigate these challenges by reducing delay and hardware area, although often at the cost of precision. This paper introduces an efficient method for computing binary logarithms and antilogarithms using uniformly segmented linear regression. In the proposed approach, the input signal is decomposed into integer and fractional components. Linear regression models are developed for computing logarithms and antilogarithms within equally spaced intervals of the fractional part, with the appropriated model selected based on a predefined number of the most significant bits of the fractional component. Comparative evaluations against benchmark techniques demonstrate the proposed method’s superiority in terms of computational accuracy, making it well-suited for DSP tasks in edge computing environments.

  Interactive Web: Leveraging Ai-driven Code Generation to Simplify Algorithm Development for Novice Programmers in Web-based Applications   
 Kai Zhang 1  , Vyom Kumar 2  , Max Zhang 3  , 1  Moreau Catholic High School, 2  Moreau Catholic High School, 2  Irvington High School, USA  
 ABSTRACT   
 In the history of computer science, the development of algorithms has been key to composing the many programs used everyday by civilians, such as programs for texting, entertainment, research, and anything on the internet [9]. However, all of these programs are expensive and time-intensive to create. Even if completing a singular project is not particularly difficult, the knowledge required to create that project might take years to learn. Since the development of AI, the process of fabricating algorithms has been shortened greatly. Anybody with internet access can make software using AI, but a novice in programming would still struggle with creating new code from a Pseudocode created by AI [10]. By utilizing the OpenAI API, we created InteractiveWeb, a program that takes input from a user, sends it to ChatGPT, and, after creating an initial model of that program, develops a new and improved version of that previous code. With this program, the AI could accurately develop instructed projects, allowing it to create the fully working games of Minesweeper, Connect 4, and even Chess.

  Rule by Rule: Learning with Confidence Through Vocabulary Expansion   
 Albert Nossig, Tobias Hell, and Georg Moser, Department of Computer Science, University of Innsbruck, Data Lab Hell GmbH, Europastraße 2a, 6170 Zirl, Tyrol, Austria  
 ABSTRACT   
 In this paper, we present an innovative iterative approach to rule learning specifically designed for (but not limited to) text-based data. Our method focuses on progressively expanding the vocabulary utilized in each iteration resulting in a significant reduction of memory consumption. Moreover, we introduce a Value of Confidence as an indicator of the reliability of the generated rules. By leveraging the Value of Confidence, our approach ensures that only the most robust and trustworthy rules are retained, thereby improving the overall quality of the rule learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on various textual as well as non-textual datasets including a use case of significant interest to insurance industries, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.

  Beyond Specialization: Assessing the Capabilities of MLLMs in Age and Gender Estimation   
 Maksim Kuprashevich, Grigorii Alekseenko, and Irina Tolstykh, R&D Department, Salutedev, Uzbekistan  
 ABSTRACT   
 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently gained immense popularity. Powerful commercial models like ChatGPT and Gemini, as well as open-source ones such as LLaVA, are essentially general-purpose models and are applied to solve a wide variety of tasks, including those in computer vision. These neural networks possess such strong general knowledge and reasoning abilities that they have proven capable of working even on tasks for which they were not specifically trained. We compared the capabilities of the most powerful MLLMs to date: ShareGPT4V, ChatGPT-4V/4O, LLaVA-Next in a specialized task of age and gender estimation with state-of-the-art specialized model. This comparison has yielded some interesting results and insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the participating models. Furthermore, we attempted various ways to fine-tune the ShareGPT4V model for this specific task, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in this particular challenge. Although such a model would not be practical in production, as it is incredibly expensive compared to a specialized model, it could be very useful in some tasks, like data annotation.

  A Smart Caffeine Level Predicting and Analysis Solution With Sequential Machine Learning Model Using Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision   
 Tianrui Zhang 1  , Ang Li 2  , 1  School of Professional Studies, Northwestern University, 633 Clark St, Evanston, IL 60208, 2  California State University, Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840  
 ABSTRACT   
 Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant globally, yet its overconsumption poses significant health risks. Traditional methods for measuring caffeine content, such as weighing coffee, can be impractical in everyday settings. This paper proposes an innovative solution that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning specifically utilizing a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to predict caffeine levels based on image analysis of coffee. The system processes images to determine brightness, correlating this data with caffeine concentration on a defined scale. Challenges such as dataset selection, prediction accuracy variability, and training epoch limitations were addressed through data cleaning and iterative model training. Experiments revealed that the model achieves a high accuracy rate, indicating its potential as a practical tool for consumers aiming to monitor their caffeine intake. This application not only enhances user convenience but also promotes healthier consumption practices by providing a reliable method for estimating caffeine levels visually

  Electronic Games in Education: Use of Media as a Pedagogical Resource   
 Renan Colzani da Rocha, Alexia Silva da Silveira Araujo, Daniel Lima Lins de Vasconcellos, Letícia Debastiani Frana, Flavio Andaló and Milton Luiz Horn Vieira, Department of Management, Media and Technology, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brazil  
 ABSTRACT   
 This article seeks to analyze the theoretical bases that support the construction of a fun educational game, elaborating a structure for the creation of games through theoretical concepts studied from the perspective of psychology and its relationship with this type of media. In view of the growth in the consumption of electronic games as entertainment among children and young people in the twenty-first century, we thought about the construction of an educational electronic game that contains three elements that are considered part of what makes games fun, the challenge, the fantasy or narrative, and curiosity. Using as an example the use of historical narrative as an educational tool developed in the games of the Assassins Creed series, a project was created to develop an educational game set in Florianópolis in the 1950s, starring the artist and folklorist Franklin Cascaes, and based on the short stories published in the book The Fantastic on the Island of Santa Catarina. This article presents the results of the historical research carried out for the development of the games first map, as well as a summary of its narrative and mechanics.

 ABSTRACT   
 In this paper, we presents the development of a stock and ETF forecasting mobile platform using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The platform collects historical stock data using web scraping techniques (Beautiful Soup) from sources such as Yahoo Finance and Google Finance. We applied Linear Regression, SVM, and LSTM models to predict stock trends and evaluated their performance based on accuracy and efficiency.The experiments showed that while Linear Regression offers quick predictions, it lacks the ability to handle complex market behavior. SVM performed better for classifying trend directions but struggled during periods of volatility. LSTM networks though computationally intensive, provided the highest accuracy by capturing sequential patterns in the data. This multi-model approach ensures the platform offers investors both speed and precision, providing actionable insights. Future improvements will focus on incorporating hyperparameter optimization and sentiment analysis to further enhance predictive performance.

 Connect With The Defence Sector and Leading Researchers  

 Open to industry and universities, DSI’s Collaborative Research Grants are designed to encourage joint projects between Victorian universities and local industry or Defence. Grants up to $50,000 are available and are intended to provide seed or exploratory funding.  
 We help you connect with potential collaboration partners within the Australian and international defence community. Preference is given to new collaborations and for projects with immediate or potential leverage.  
 Working with a top university could lead to valuable commercial breakthroughs and new opportunities. Australia’s universities offer world-leading defence science researchers and technologies, which we help make accessible to businesses of all sizes through our research collaboration grants.  
 The Collaborative Research Grant is designed to help SMEs take a step into research by removing some of the financial and administrative obstacles businesses can face. We will advise and support you every step of the way during the discovery phase, including making recommendations and introductions to the most suitable institutions for your business.  

 DSI acknowledges the traditional Aboriginal owners of country throughout Australia, their ongoing connection to this land. We pay our respects to their culture and their Elders past, present and future.

 Update to the AIAI Community from the Organisers  
 Dear Colleagues,  
 On behalf of the 21 st  AIAI (Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations) 2025 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects.  
 The Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations  (AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globe.  
 The h-index of the AIAI event is as high as 39  . This proves the novelty and quality of the presented-published research and its important contribution to the promotion of scientific ideas, algorithms and methods, globally. The fact that the conference Springer Proceedings, have been downloaded more than 2,800,000  times so far, supports the robust impact of the event among the scholars of AI internationally.. …[read more]

 AIED 2025  

 General call for paper  
  
 The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy.   
 The AIED 2025 theme is  
 “AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”  
  
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressing at an unprecedented rate, with generative AI and related technologies leading this transformative shift. These advancements are set to reshape education in significant ways, offering novel opportunities to enhance both teaching and learning processes. At the same time, more ‘traditional’ AI techniques continue to be developed, bringing in new insights. AI is expanding the horizons of what is achievable in education, enabling the creation of personalised and dynamic learning experiences. As these technologies continue to evolve, they equip educators with powerful tools to gain deeper insights into student needs, tailor instruction and resources to individual learning paths, and promote greater student engagement. AI is no longer merely an auxiliary tool — it is fundamentally transforming the core of educational practices, making learning environments more adaptive, accessible, and impactful.  
 The AIED 2025 conference, themed “AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future,”  centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalise learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalised communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy. We welcome submissions that investigate how AI can act as a catalyst for cultivating a more equitable and inclusive educational environment, ultimately empowering both teachers and students in the pursuit of a more just and accessible future.  
 AIED 2025 will be the 26th edition of this conference series. The AIED Society, organiser of the AIED conference, aims at advancing science and engineering of intelligent human-technology ecosystems that support learning. The conference will be the latest of a longstanding series of international conferences, known for high quality and innovative research on AI-assisted systems and cognitive science approaches for educational computing applications. AIED is ranked A in CORE (top 16% of all 783 ranked venues)  , the well-known ranking of computer science conferences. AIED is a venue for researchers, decision makers, stakeholders and practitioners in the areas of AI in Education, and especially welcomes teachers and industry, particularly SMEs involved in AIED. Due to the growth of this important area, AIED 2025 is implementing for the first time a track-based system.  
 Thus, for its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:  
  
  AIED architectures and tools   
 Papers submitted to this track should describe novel advances related to the software engineering of AIED systems and the development of such systems. Papers may be concerned with describing proof-of-concepts that demonstrate the feasibility of novel techniques, as well as real- world implementations that show the potential for reuse or adaptation by other researchers. Example research areas with applications in education include, but are not limited to, multi-agent architectures; tangible interfaces, wearables; speech technologies; virtual and augmented reality. Innovative, domain-specific learning application architectures and tools also find a home in this track, e.g. language, science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, military, industry, sports and more); scaling up and large-scale deployment of AIED systems. While papers may describe a user evaluation of the system or tool, the primary scientific contribution of papers submitted to this track should be technical and systems-oriented.  
  Machine learning and Generative AI   
 Papers submitted to this track should describe advances in or applications of AI-based techniques within education, involving knowledge representation and machine learning. Generative AI-based techniques are also welcome within this track. Data-driven processing techniques (educational data mining, deep learning, machine learning) in education will constitute the main focus of this track. Example areas are natural language processing for education, video data mining for education, etc. Papers will likely address novel contributions related to modeling learner, teacher, and other stakeholder processes and outcomes, or contributions to representing learning domains. Evaluation techniques in this track rely on computational analyses. While papers will likely describe evaluations on previous datasets or newly collected data, the primary scientific contribution of these papers will be to AI and its application.  
  Learning, teaching and pedagogy   
 Papers submitted to this track should describe approaches to teaching, learning and evaluations of AIED systems that relate to pedagogical techniques, learning processes, and outcomes, conceived broadly. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis, as well as mixed-methods approaches are encouraged under this paper category. AIED systems targeted here include, but are not limited, to: AI-assisted tutoring and scaffolding; Motivational diagnosis and feedback; Learner engagement; Interactive pedagogical agents and learning companions; Agents that promote metacognition, motivation and positive affect; Adaptive question-answering and dialogue, Data-driven modeling (educational data mining, deep learning, machine learning,…); Learning analytics and teaching support, Learning with simulations; Explainability of models for teaching and learning. Learning targeted here refers to both formal and informal learning, including game-based learning; collaborative and group learning; social networks; inquiry learning; social dimensions of learning; communities of practice; ubiquitous learning environments; learning through construction and making; learning grid; lifelong learning; learning in informal settings (museum, workplace, etc.); learning in the physical space; learning of motor skills. Evaluations here include studies on human learning. Learning spaces include massive open online courses; remote learning in k-12 schools; synchronous and asynchronous learning; mobile learning; active learning in virtual settings; video-based learning; mixed reality and learning. Papers may involve a novel system or a previously existing system, but the primary scientific contribution should be towards understanding the effects of the system and its features on learners, teachers, or other stakeholders.  
  Human-centered design and design-based research   
 Papers submitted to this track should address design principles for AIED systems or methods for designing such systems, as well as broadening understanding of contextual and individual factors that might inform users’ interactions with these systems. Papers submitted to this track can explore the design, use, and evaluation of human-AI hybrid systems for learning: research that explores the potential of human-AI interaction in educational contexts; systems and approaches in which educational stakeholders and AI tools build upon each other’s complementary strengths to achieve educational outcomes and/or improve mutually. Solutions explored in this track include human-AI partnership: shared decision making between systems and users that promote agency and improve learning. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis user-centered design methods are encouraged under this paper category. Papers may involve the study of systems or prototypes that do not currently contain AI, as long as the primary purpose of the paper is to inform the design of AIED systems, putting the user (human) in the center. Evaluations in this track include: Studies on human cognition, affect, motivation, engagement, and attitudes; design and formative studies of AIED systems. While these papers may also involve the development of a mockup for a new system, the primary scientific contribution should be towards principles for the design of features of similar systems in similar contexts.  
  Teaching AI    
 Papers submitted to this track should involve methods, principles, or technologies for teaching AI or supporting the development of AI literacy. This includes studies on skills and knowledge that enable individuals to understand, use, and critically evaluate AI; definitions of AI literacy; learning to use AI; developing a basic understanding of how AI works; learning to communicate and collaborate with AI; learning to live with AI, understanding limitations and problems of AI. This track especially welcomes work done by or in collaboration with teachers at all levels, from primary to university education. Papers in this track should preferably be based on empirical studies, including small-scale, classroom sized studies; although larger scale studies and theoretical contributions around the topic of teaching AI are also welcomed. Thus, the primary scientific contribution should be towards analysing or improving methods of teaching AI and development of AI literacy.  
  Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society     
 Papers submitted to this track should take a perspective on AIED as it relates to society at different levels, more broadly, including the ethics of AIED, or designing AIED systems for a more equitable and just future. This includes AIED equity and inclusion-related theoretical or practical studies on socio-economic, gender, and racial issues; AI-assisted techniques to support students from under-resourced schools and communities; sponsorship, scientific validity, participant’s rights and responsibilities, data collection, management and dissemination. Additionally, it includes papers on ethics of AI in education, such as papers on explainability, transparency, accountability, and responsible AIED; learner consent and opt out; surveillance and privacy; the impact of AIED on teachers, learners and classrooms from an ethics perspective; teacher empowerment and student agency; the community’s responsibility for commercial applications; AIED ethical frameworks and principles for application. This track also includes AIED for development themes, such as leveraging AI technology to address and improve various aspects of development in societies and education, particularly in low and middle-income countries; AIED divide; AIED unplugged; Low-cost solutions; low-tech solutions; frugal Innovation; Jugaad Innovation. These papers may include systematic reviews of the literature or position papers on a particular issue. Both empirical results and theory are welcome in this track, with the primary contribution towards ethics, equity and society.  
  Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education     
 Papers submitted to this track should include conceptual or theoretical models, knowledge representation and models, or reasoning related to AIED and human interaction with AIED systems. Papers will likely address novel contributions related to modelling learner (including open learner models), teacher, and other stakeholder modelling processes, or contributions to representing learning domains. Other areas include, but are not limited, to: modelling of facilitators, tasks and problem-solving processes; models of groups and communities for learning; modeling motivation, metacognition, and affective aspects of learning; ontological modeling; computational thinking and model-building; representing and analysing activity flow and discourse during learning; representing and modeling psychomotor learning. Expanding and evaluating cognitive, motivational and affective theories within AIED context also constitutes a target of this track. Papers in this track can further be using bottom-up and top-down approaches to analyse data, in order to inform motivational, learning, cognitive theories and gain better understanding of the socio-cognitive nature of learning. The primary contribution of these papers can be of empirical results analysing theoretical aspects, or direct contributions to theories and theoretical models applicable to AIED.  

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion   
 The AIED Society values diversity, equity, and inclusion (and related principles under this broad umbrella) as essential and fundamental values for the AIED community to uphold. Thus, in AIED 2025, we encourage authors to:  
 Write with care toward inclusive language (e.g., understanding identify-first vs. person-first language, gender neutral language, appropriate demographic categories and terminology, and avoiding the conflation of distinct dimensions such as race and ethnicity, or sex and gender). 
  Report methodology including descriptions of sample characteristics (e.g., demographic data), any procedures for inclusive and representative sampling, any barriers to inclusive and representative sampling, and the ethical issues addressed both in the research methodology and the AIED approaches or tools being researched. For example, it is important to report the strategies used to control or reduce bias against populations of any kind (e.g. benefit or bring prejudice to a particular gender, race, or people with different economic status) when collecting, using, or aggregating data both for the research and for the AIED approach or tool being researched. 
  Consider how their theoretical frameworks and findings are related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, authors may discuss how these issues influence key assumptions, hypotheses, and methods. 
  Address implications or appropriate interpretations of their findings with respect to diversity, inclusion and equity. 

 Submission Instructions   
 We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks :   
 Full paper submission: | Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper. 
  Short paper submission: | Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks. 
  Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v  .  
 Please note that presenters of papers accepted to the main conference are expected to be on-site to give their presentations and to interact with the audience  . An online streaming option will be set-up for remote observers. Scholarships are available for researchers who lack funding to present at the conference, see website for more information. Workshops may however run hybrid, at the discretion of their organisers (for further information, see their websites).  
 Papers accepted to be published in the conference proceedings must have a unique onsite author registration (i.e., one registration per paper).  
 Authors should note that following AIED 2024, there will be NO downgrade path from main submissions to posters  . Authors whose papers submitted as main submissions are not accepted either as full or short paper are encouraged to revise and consider other submission types such as the late-breaking results or workshops. Note that due to the nature of the submission type, posters are to be presented physically at the conference; no remote presentation of posters will be allowed  .  
 We will announce further details for other submission types within AIED 2025 including:  
 Blue Sky: position papers envisioning the future of AIED 
  WideAIED: papers on research and ideas toward widening participation in AIED (e.g. by social scientists, share experiences in the area, …). 
  Invited papers from the International Journal of AIED 
  Late-breaking results 
  Practitioners and Industry 
  Doctoral Consortium 
  Interactive events (e.g. demos) 
  Review Process   
 All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation. It is important to note that the work presented should not have been published previously or be under consideration in other conferences of journals. Any paper caught in double submission will be rejected without review.  
 Anonymity  
 The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:  
 Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems) 
  Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person 
  Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources 
  Data collection, reporting, and analysis  
 Authors should be clear and specific about the composition of human-sourced data. Who were the participants? What was the distribution of gender, race, ethnicity, or related variables? If corpus data or training data were sourced from humans, a similar description could be offered.  
 Skewed or non-representative samples would not necessarily trigger a “reject” decision, but authors should acknowledge the demographic imbalances and discuss the potential impact on data, results, or conclusions. A more compelling paper would describe steps taken to generate an inclusive and representative sample (this is basic science, but often overlooked for convenience).  
 Authors are encouraged to discuss/justify how demographic variables are included in the analyses. If they are not included or “covaried out” please justify. If they are included, what are the assumptions? Are there “categorical effects”? Are the effects of different demographic variables independent, interdependent, or intersectional? What valid conclusions can be drawn? What erroneous conclusions need to be avoided or tempered?  
 Ethics  
 Authors should demonstrate some awareness of how ethical issues (including but not limited to equity, inclusion, accessibility) impact their data, methods, tools, approaches, products, and findings. How are different demographic groups or communities differentially connected to the work? People who are developing educational technologies need to think about access and use, for example. Corpus analyses need to address the impact of skewed/exclusive datasets and potential outcomes (e.g., algorithmic bias).  
 Submission Procedure and Publication of Accepted Contributions   
  
 All submissions must be in Springer format. Papers that do not use the required format may be rejected without review. Authors should consult Springer’s   authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs   in their papers. Submissions are handled via EasyChair  .

While these papers may also involve the development of a mockup for a new system, the primary scientific contribution should be towards principles for the design of features of similar systems in similar contexts.  
  Teaching AI    
 Papers submitted to this track should involve methods, principles, or technologies for teaching AI or supporting the development of AI literacy. This includes studies on skills and knowledge that enable individuals to understand, use, and critically evaluate AI; definitions of AI literacy; learning to use AI; developing a basic understanding of how AI works; learning to communicate and collaborate with AI; learning to live with AI, understanding limitations and problems of AI. This track especially welcomes work done by or in collaboration with teachers at all levels, from primary to university education. Papers in this track should preferably be based on empirical studies, including small-scale, classroom sized studies; although larger scale studies and theoretical contributions around the topic of teaching AI are also welcomed. Thus, the primary scientific contribution should be towards analysing or improving methods of teaching AI and development of AI literacy.  
  Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society     
 Papers submitted to this track should take a perspective on AIED as it relates to society at different levels, more broadly, including the ethics of AIED, or designing AIED systems for a more equitable and just future. This includes AIED equity and inclusion-related theoretical or practical studies on socio-economic, gender, and racial issues; AI-assisted techniques to support students from under-resourced schools and communities; sponsorship, scientific validity, participant’s rights and responsibilities, data collection, management and dissemination. Additionally, it includes papers on ethics of AI in education, such as papers on explainability, transparency, accountability, and responsible AIED; learner consent and opt out; surveillance and privacy; the impact of AIED on teachers, learners and classrooms from an ethics perspective; teacher empowerment and student agency; the community’s responsibility for commercial applications; AIED ethical frameworks and principles for application. This track also includes AIED for development themes, such as leveraging AI technology to address and improve various aspects of development in societies and education, particularly in low and middle-income countries; AIED divide; AIED unplugged; Low-cost solutions; low-tech solutions; frugal Innovation; Jugaad Innovation. These papers may include systematic reviews of the literature or position papers on a particular issue. Both empirical results and theory are welcome in this track, with the primary contribution towards ethics, equity and society.  
  Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education     
 Papers submitted to this track should include conceptual or theoretical models, knowledge representation and models, or reasoning related to AIED and human interaction with AIED systems. Papers will likely address novel contributions related to modelling learner (including open learner models), teacher, and other stakeholder modelling processes, or contributions to representing learning domains. Other areas include, but are not limited, to: modelling of facilitators, tasks and problem-solving processes; models of groups and communities for learning; modeling motivation, metacognition, and affective aspects of learning; ontological modeling; computational thinking and model-building; representing and analysing activity flow and discourse during learning; representing and modeling psychomotor learning. Expanding and evaluating cognitive, motivational and affective theories within AIED context also constitutes a target of this track. Papers in this track can further be using bottom-up and top-down approaches to analyse data, in order to inform motivational, learning, cognitive theories and gain better understanding of the socio-cognitive nature of learning. The primary contribution of these papers can be of empirical results analysing theoretical aspects, or direct contributions to theories and theoretical models applicable to AIED.  

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion   
 The AIED Society values diversity, equity, and inclusion (and related principles under this broad umbrella) as essential and fundamental values for the AIED community to uphold. Thus, in AIED 2025, we encourage authors to:  
 Write with care toward inclusive language (e.g., understanding identify-first vs. person-first language, gender neutral language, appropriate demographic categories and terminology, and avoiding the conflation of distinct dimensions such as race and ethnicity, or sex and gender). 
  Report methodology including descriptions of sample characteristics (e.g., demographic data), any procedures for inclusive and representative sampling, any barriers to inclusive and representative sampling, and the ethical issues addressed both in the research methodology and the AIED approaches or tools being researched. For example, it is important to report the strategies used to control or reduce bias against populations of any kind (e.g. benefit or bring prejudice to a particular gender, race, or people with different economic status) when collecting, using, or aggregating data both for the research and for the AIED approach or tool being researched. 
  Consider how their theoretical frameworks and findings are related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, authors may discuss how these issues influence key assumptions, hypotheses, and methods. 
  Address implications or appropriate interpretations of their findings with respect to diversity, inclusion and equity. 

 Submission Instructions   
 We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks :   
 Full paper submission: | Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper. 
  Short paper submission: | Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks. 
  Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v  .  
 Please note that presenters of papers accepted to the main conference are expected to be on-site to give their presentations and to interact with the audience  . An online streaming option will be set-up for remote observers. Scholarships are available for researchers who lack funding to present at the conference, see website for more information. Workshops may however run hybrid, at the discretion of their organisers (for further information, see their websites).  
 Papers accepted to be published in the conference proceedings must have a unique onsite author registration (i.e., one registration per paper).  
 Authors should note that following AIED 2024, there will be NO downgrade path from main submissions to posters  . Authors whose papers submitted as main submissions are not accepted either as full or short paper are encouraged to revise and consider other submission types such as the late-breaking results or workshops. Note that due to the nature of the submission type, posters are to be presented physically at the conference; no remote presentation of posters will be allowed  .  
 We will announce further details for other submission types within AIED 2025 including:  
 Blue Sky: position papers envisioning the future of AIED 
  WideAIED: papers on research and ideas toward widening participation in AIED (e.g. by social scientists, share experiences in the area, …). 
  Invited papers from the International Journal of AIED 
  Late-breaking results 
  Practitioners and Industry 
  Doctoral Consortium 
  Interactive events (e.g. demos) 
  Review Process   
 All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation. It is important to note that the work presented should not have been published previously or be under consideration in other conferences of journals. Any paper caught in double submission will be rejected without review.  
 Anonymity  
 The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:  
 Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems) 
  Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person 
  Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources 
  Data collection, reporting, and analysis  
 Authors should be clear and specific about the composition of human-sourced data. Who were the participants? What was the distribution of gender, race, ethnicity, or related variables? If corpus data or training data were sourced from humans, a similar description could be offered.  
 Skewed or non-representative samples would not necessarily trigger a “reject” decision, but authors should acknowledge the demographic imbalances and discuss the potential impact on data, results, or conclusions. A more compelling paper would describe steps taken to generate an inclusive and representative sample (this is basic science, but often overlooked for convenience).  
 Authors are encouraged to discuss/justify how demographic variables are included in the analyses. If they are not included or “covaried out” please justify. If they are included, what are the assumptions? Are there “categorical effects”? Are the effects of different demographic variables independent, interdependent, or intersectional? What valid conclusions can be drawn? What erroneous conclusions need to be avoided or tempered?  
 Ethics  
 Authors should demonstrate some awareness of how ethical issues (including but not limited to equity, inclusion, accessibility) impact their data, methods, tools, approaches, products, and findings. How are different demographic groups or communities differentially connected to the work? People who are developing educational technologies need to think about access and use, for example. Corpus analyses need to address the impact of skewed/exclusive datasets and potential outcomes (e.g., algorithmic bias).  
 Submission Procedure and Publication of Accepted Contributions   
  
 All submissions must be in Springer format. Papers that do not use the required format may be rejected without review. Authors should consult Springer’s   authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs   in their papers. Submissions are handled via EasyChair  .  
 Accepted AIED 2025 papers for the main submissions will be published by Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI), a subseries of Lectures Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Paper lengths are as follows:  
 Full papers (12 pages | excluding | references; for a long oral presentation)

 IFIP AIAI Community  

 Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations (AIAI conference) started from Toulouse France.   
 Today, its society comprises of hundreds AI experts-enthusiasts, academicians and researchers from all over the globe (Europe, Asia, America and Australia). They are interacting by presenting their scientific achievements or by discussing numerous aspects of AI advances, under the 4th industrial revolution.  
  The AIAI conference now has its own society, consisting of followers who have been attending it for one or two decades in the row, while new members are constantly joining its family.  
  After almost two decades of continuous presence in the literature, the members of the AIAI society, have formed a very strong community under the auspices of the IFIP Working Group 12.5 (AI applications and Innovations). This group is divided in specific scientific subgroups-subcommunities, specializing in timely hot AI areas. Their members are organizing timely annual workshops specific by subject, which are run and attended by AI professionals-scientists who wish to share knowledge, ideas, problems and insights in every AI subdomain.  

 An indicative reference to the communities – societies that have been already formed under the auspices of the AIAI conference, would include (but not limited) the following:  

 • The Community of Mining Humanistic Data (driven by the Ionian University and the University of Patras, Greece).  
  • The Community of 5G technologies putting intelligence in the network’s Edge (driven by the Hellenic Telecommunication Organization (TO) and other European Union TOs.  
  • The Community of Cybersecurity innovations and Applications driven by the European Defense Agency (the European Union Security Organization).  
  • The Community of AI and Ethics (driven by Professor John Macintyre from the University of Sunderland UK, Professor Mathhias Scheutz, Tufts School of AS and other colleagues from the USA.  

 Though the above communities are here to stay, the above list is dynamic, as new Communities devoted to new AI subdomains are joining to this global event every year.  
  Apart from the papers’ presentation, the distinguished members of the AIAI (IFIP WG12.5) society are offering new insights by giving free Tutorials to conference delegates. This adds actual more merit to the event and enhances the benefits of the members of the AIAI community  
  One of the many benefits for the members of these subcommunities is the fact that they bring together scientists, who are interested either in a narrow specific domain or in hot multidisciplinary areas, or in an emerging subject. This can lead to increased connection and awareness of developments.  
  Under the framework of this community, new researchers are encouraged to proceed further to their developments, by receiving best papers awards together with financial awards, or checks provided by Springer to offer them free access to important scientific publications. Moreover, under the guise of noble rivalry, old and young researchers are invited to complete their research and submit their extended paper for review in prestigious scientific journals. Especially for the young researchers of the AIAI community, this is a unique opportunity to publish not only in the springer proceedings which have millions of recent citations, but also in major scientific journals with a high citation rate.

 Call for Submissions   
  
 The AIME 2025 conference invites all interested researchers to submit original contributions on the development of theory, methods, systems, and applications of AI in biomedicine, including the application of AI approaches in biomedical informatics, healthcare organization, and molecular medicine.  

 Important Dates   
  
 Submission opening: October 1, 2024  
  Abstract submission deadline: January 27, 2025  
  Paper submission deadline: February 3, 2025  
  Notification of acceptance: March 26, 2025  
  Camera-ready submission deadline: April 8, 2025  
  Main conference: June 23-26, 2025  

 Scope   
  
 Contributions to theory and methods should present or analyze novel AI theories or methodologies for solving problems in the biomedical field. They may propose new theories and methods or extensions of existing ones. In either case, the work should demonstrate its utility for solving biomedical problems and highlight its contribution to the underlying theoretical foundations. In addition, it should discuss assumptions, limitations, and novelty with respect to the state of the art.  
 Contributions addressing systems and applications should describe the development, implementation or evaluation of innovative, AI-based tools and systems in the biomedical application domain. These papers should both link the work to the underlying theory and either analyze the potential benefits for solving biomedical problems or provide empirical evidence of benefits in clinical practice.  
 The scope of the conference includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:  
 Machine learning and big data analytics 
  Natural language processing 
  Document classification and information retrieval 
  Large language models and their biomedical applications 
  AI for biomedical imaging 
  AI for signal processing and time series analysis 
  Foundational models and zero/few shots learning 
  Multimodal learning and information fusion 
  Data and knowledge integration, graph neural networks 
  Visual analytics in biomedicine 
  Bayesian networks, fuzzy logic and reasoning under uncertainty 
  Temporal and spatial representation and reasoning 
  Biomedical ontologies and terminologies 
  Knowledge-based reasoning in biomedicine 
  Clinical decision support systems 
  Healthcare processes and workflow management 
  Computerized clinical practice guidelines and protocols 
  Patient engagement support (personal healthcare record) 
  Explainable AI 
  Precision medicine 
  AI solutions for ambient assisted living, telemedicine, and e-health 

 Awards   
  
 The Mario Stefanelli award  is given to the best student paper, according to the conference steering committee, based on the quality of both the paper and oral presentation at the conference.  
 The Marco Ramoni award  is given to the best regular paper, according to the conference steering committee, based on the scientific quality of the paper.  
 AIME Rising Star award  is aimed at younger colleagues running their labs with recent breakthrough papers in the area. If you would like to nominate someone for this award, please email your proposal to annette.ten.teije@vu.nl  and robertmo@bgu.ac.il  by March 1st. The criteria for the award and other information will be available on the AIME 2025 website  .  

 Student Travel Grants   
  
 We will offer six travel grants to students who are authors of accepted papers (full or short) and who will present their work during the AIME 2025 conference. Each grant will cover travel costs up to EUR 500.00 (if these costs are less than EUR 500.00, the actual amount will be covered).  
 Preference will be given to students who are not members of the Doctoral Consortium (the latter will provide participation grants). We will also take into account the quality of the submitted work as indicated by the reviews. Applications will be accepted until April 30, 2025, decisions will be announced in early May, and grants will be awarded during the conference. Applicants should send the title of their accepted paper, formal proof of student status, and an electronic copy or scan of their tickets by email to silvia.ferrari@pragmacongressi.it  with the subject line “AIME 2025 Student travel grants”.  

 Submission   
  
 Papers should be submitted to the AIME 2025 Easy Chair Website  . Authors are asked first to submit an abstract (maximum 250 words), the full paper may be uploaded up to one week later (please see Important Dates above).  
 The conference features regular papers in three categories (please note if you are a student submitting a paper):  
 Full-length research papers (up to 10 pages, including references) 
  Short papers (max 5 pages, including references), describing a short research project with preliminary results or late-breaking results (work-in-progress) 
  Demo papers (max 5 pages, including references), describing a demonstration of implemented systems 
  Demos of applications are welcome, authors must submit a demo paper (see above). The demo track will provide opportunities to present software to individuals and small groups of attendees.  
 All accepted papers (full, short & demo) will be published in the conference proceedings, which will be published as part of Springer’s Lecture Notes in AI series. Papers should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS format and one of the categories (Full paper, Short paper, Demo paper) must be selected at the time of submission. Authors should follow Springer’s guidelines for authors  and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, to prepare their papers. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available in Overleaf. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their submissions.  

 Publication   
  
 The proceedings will be published by Springer as part of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI)  , a subseries of LNCS  dedicated to artificial intelligence research. Please note that for a paper to be published, at least one of its authors must pay a full registration fee.  
 Proceedings from prior AIME conferences can be viewed on SpringerLink  .  
 Authors of the best accepted papers will be invited to expand and refine their manuscripts for possible publication in the Elsevier journal Artificial Intelligence in Medicine  .

  The 19 th  International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems, Applications AIMSA 2024   
   
  - Towards efficient and sustainable AI methods, systems and applications -  
   
  Golden Sands resort, Varna, Bulgaria September 18 th  - 20 th  , 2024  
   
  **** Proceedings published by Springer/LNCS ****     

 Initiated in 1984, the biennial Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems, Applications (AIMSA) conference is a premier single-track forum for exchanging information and research results on theory and principles of artificial intelligence (AI) along with real-world applications of intelligent systems technology. The conference traditionally brings together researchers and practitioners in all areas of AI from both the academia and industry to meet and share their ideas and experiences and learn about the recent trends and developments in contemporary AI.  
 The 19 th  edition of AIMSA will be held in the beautiful Golden Sands resort near Varna, Bulgaria. With its mild climate and excellent opportunities for outdoor activities, water sports and gastronomy, Golden Sands promise to be a wonderful venue for a memorable conference.  
 TOPICS   The conference is looking for submissions offering innovative methods, systems and applications that demonstrate efficiency and sustainability for the future of AI. Efficiency can be demonstrated against current and traditional methods, systems and applications. Sustainability relates to the required resources, computational power, human wellbeing, positive impact on science and the society.  
 The conference will have three streams, namely:  
 Innovative methods for efficient and sustainable AI 
  Systems for the development and the implementations of efficient and sustainable AI 
  Novel efficient and sustainable AI applications 
   
 All submissions will be subject to a single-blind academic peer review by at least three members of the program committee. Selection criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and quality of presentation.  
 The author(s) of the best paper (which will be selected based on the votes of the attendees) of the conference will receive the Best Paper Award during the conference.

 Advances in Modal Logic is a unique international forum for presenting the latest results and new directions of research in Modal Logic broadly conceived. The topics dealt with are of interdisciplinary interest and range from mathematical, computational, and philosophical problems to applications in knowledge representation and formal linguistics. This volume contains invited and contributed papers from the seventh conference in the AiML series, held in Nancy, France, in September 2008. It reports on substantial advances, both in the foundations of modal logic and in a number of application areas. It includes papers on the metatheory of a variety of modal logics; on systems for spatial and temporal reasoning and interpreting natural language; on the emerging coalgebraic perspective; and on historical views of the nature of modality.

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 Reviewed in the United States on 30 September 2012  Verified Purchase     
 Item was ordered on Aug. 29, 2012 from an initial financial assessment of feasibility and timing of this acquisition target of around 8/13, but delayed constantly, hourly, due to local living conditions. After 8/28, I moved the project forward anyway and scrapped other priority project goals for timing.  
  Arrived on 9/4 by 1300 or 1330 CDT in spite of local living conditions posited interference. Interesting material which I needed to get to.

   Phra That Doi Suthep   

  It’s no secret that Chiang Mai is home to many temples, which you may have seen several of on a visit to the Northern Thai city. But even if you’ve had your fill of temples (or think you’ve seen them all), planning a trip to see Wat Doi Suthep is worth your time, even if just for the photo-worthy views. In addition to those aforementioned views, the golden, gleaming temple itself is highlight, but don’t rush your visit. There’s something beautiful to see at every turn. Wat Phra That Doi Suthep temple also houses a meditation center, where both locals and visitors can learn and practice meditation.   
  Thapae Walking Street   

  It's a walking street opening every Sunday. There are many goods, especially local items and hand made items. The street is located from Thapae Gate through Klangwiang intersection and split along the four lines of the intersection to Wat Phrasing. There are local goods, clothing, northern-style bags, pictures, handicrafts, local food, snacks, souvenirs, and silverware, which are not inexpensive.   
  Doi Ang Khang   

  It's a doi street opening every Sunday. There are many goods, especially local items and hand made items. The street is located from Thapae Gate through Klangwiang intersection and split along the four lines of the intersection to Wat Phrasing. There are local goods, clothing, northern-style bags, pictures, handicrafts, local food, snacks, souvenirs, and silverware, which are not inexpensive.   
  Nimmanhaemin Road   

  Nimmanhaemin Road, a crucial business area of Chiang Mai, is connectable between Rin Kham Intersection and Suthep Road. The beginning of this road was when Gi and Gim Ho Nimmanhaemin donated the piece of land that covers the area from the foot of Suthep Mountain through Suan Dok Gate to the Thai Government to found Chiang Mai University in 1963. Presently, Nimmanhaemin became one of the most important commercial spots of the province which is plenty of shops, restaurant, accommodation, and entertainment resulted in the reputation as “the hippest street in Chiang Mai”.   
  Doi Inthanon   

  Doi Inthanon National Park is home to Thailand’s highest mountain. The mountain, also known as the “Roof of Thailand,” rises to a height of 2,565 meters. Due to the high altitude, the climate in Doi Inthanon National Park is much cooler than in other areas in Thailand. The 482 square kilometre park is famous for its stunning nature trails, lush rainforests, breathtaking viewpoints, rushing waterfalls, and the stunning twin pagodas that sit at the summit. It’s also home to diverse species of reptiles, birds, and mammals. It’s the perfect destination to get away and indulge in nature. So, if you want to experience a trip off the beaten track, here’s our guide to Doi Inthanon National Park!

 Update to the AIAI Community from the Organisers  
 Dear Colleagues,  
 On behalf of the 21 st  AIAI (Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations) 2025 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects.  
 The Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations  (AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community.

  This paper explores the presence and forms of evaluation in articles published in the journal Artificial Intelligence and Law for the ten-year period from 2005 through 2014. It represents a meta-level study of some the most significant works produced by the AI and Law community, in this case nearly 140 research articles published in the AI and Law journal. It also compares its findings to ... [Show full abstract]  previous work conducted on evaluation appearing in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL). In addition, the paper highlights works harnessing performance evaluation as one of their chief scientific tools and the means by which they use it. It extends the argument for why evaluation is essential in formal Artificial Intelligence and Law reports such as those in the journal. As in the case of two earlier works on the topic, it pursues answers to the questions: how good is the system, algorithm or proposal?, how reliable is the approach or technique?, and, ultimately, does the method work? The paper investigates the role of performance evaluation in scientific research reports, underscoring the argument that a performance-based 'ethic' signifies a level of maturity and scientific rigor within a community. In addition, the work examines recent publications that address the same critical issue within the broader field of Artificial Intelligence.

 Special Session:     
 AI in Medical Imaging for the Early Detection of Major  
  Non-Communicable Diseases    

 The primary aim of this session is to discuss major AI developments in the field of medical imaging for six different radiological sub-specialties. Papers would cover AI advances in the areas of thoracic, cardiac, breast, liver, neuro, and musculoskeletal imaging, with a focus on implementation of AI software in clinical radiological practice for the early detection of non-communicable disease which are leading causes of mortality worldwide.    

 AI in Thoracic Imaging 
  The papers should cover original researches on AI software implementation in lung cancer screening settings to reduce radiologist workload. Lung cancer screening is essential for the early detection of lung cancer which remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. AI is necessary in this field to overcome the major challenge of the global radiologist workforce shortfall which stands to hinder the implementation of large-scale lung cancer screening programs.    

 AI in Cardiac Imaging 
  The papers should cover original researches on AI coronary artery calcium (CAC) detection and classification and the implications for implementation into clinical practice for the early detection of coronary artery disease, a leading cause of mortality worldwide.     
  
 AI in Breast Imaging 
  The paper should cover reviews of the integration of AI into breast cancer screening for the reading of mammograms. Current European clinical practice guidelines dictate two radiologists perform and independent read of all mammograms performed, followed by a third arbitration read by a third senior radiologist for any discrepancies. AI shows potential to replace either one radiologist or perform a standalone read without reducing cancer detection accuracy, meaning a substantial reduction in radiologist workload could be achieved.    

 AI in Liver Imaging 
  The papers should cover reviews on applications of AI software for improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing invasive procedures for the detection of liver diseases.    

 AI in Neuro Imaging 
  The papers should cover reviews on the use of AI software to enhance radiologist performance and interpretation time of non-enhanced CT scans for the assessment and characterization of early ischemic brain tissue injury seen in ischemic stroke patients. Also, although in earlier stages of development, AI shows promise for detection of intercranial hemorrhage, which would help enable triage of cases requiring immediate review by a radiologist.    

 AI in Musculoskeletal Imaging 
  The papers should cover reviews on AI applications in MSK imaging detailing where AI could assist radiologists to optimize their workflow for fracture detection and classification, bone age estimation, osteoarthritis, and bone-soft tissue tumors.

  Paper Submission (Proceedings Track)  
 The proceedings track is the standard AISTATS paper submission track. Papers will be selected via a rigorous double-blind peer-review process. All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference as contributed talks or as posters and will be published in the Proceedings.  
 Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:  
 Machine learning methods and algorithms (classification, regression unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, logic programming, …) 
  Probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, approximate inference, density estimation, tractable probabilistic models, probabilistic programming, …) 
  Theory of machine learning and statistics (optimization, computational learning theory, decision theory, online learning and bandits, game theory frequentist statistics, information theory, …) 
  Deep learning (theory, architectures, generative models, optimization for neural networks, …) 
  Reinforcement learning (theory of RL, offline/online RL, deep RL, multi-agent RL, …) 
  Ethical and trustworthy machine learning (causality, fairness interpretability, privacy, robustness, safety, …) 
  Applications of machine learning and statistics (including natural language signal processing, computer vision, physical sciences, social sciences sustainability and climate, healthcare, …) 
  Changes of title/abstract/authorship  
 The author list at the abstract  submission deadline will be considered final and no changes in authorship will be allowed.  This is to avoid new unforeseen conflict-of-interest after the bidding, which will start immediately after the abstract submission deadline. The author order can be changed after the paper is accepted. Submissions violating these rules may be deleted after the paper submission deadline without reviewing. Authors are also encouraged not to make any major changes to the title or abstract in order to ensure good matching of reviewers in the bidding process.  
 Formatting and Supplementary Material  
 Submissions are limited to 8 pages excluding references using the LaTeX style file we provide below (the page limit will be 9 for camera-ready submissions). The number of pages containing only citations and the reproducibility checklist is not limited. You can also submit a single file of additional supplementary material which may be either a pdf file (such as proof details) or a zip file for other formats/more files (such as code or videos).  Note that reviewers are under no obligation to examine the supplementary material. If you have only one supplementary pdf file, please upload it as is; otherwise gather everything to the single zip file.  
 Update September 2, 2024  : Additional supplementary material may be appended to the manuscript after the main content, and/or submitted separately in a single pdf file (such as proof details) or a zip file for other formats/more files (such as code or videos). It is the authors’ responsibility that any additional material appended to the manuscript does not conflict in content with additional material uploaded separately (e.g., the separately uploaded additional material is not an updated version of the one appended to the manuscript).  
 Update September 20, 2024  : Additional supplementary material appended to the manuscript should be placed after all the content of the manuscript, including citations and the reproducibility checklist.  
 Unlike previous years, this year’s submissions are accepted at OpenReview (instead of CMT) at https://openreview.net/group?id=aistats.org/AISTATS/2025/Conference  .  
 Formatting information (including LaTeX style files) is available in the AISTATS2025PaperPack  . We do not support submission in preparation systems other than LaTeX. Please do not modify the layout given by the style file.  
 If you have questions about the style file or its usage, please contact the publications chair or the program chairs via aistats2025conference@gmail.com  .  
 Reviewer Nomination  
 For each submission, the authors will be expected to nominate at least one of the authors as a reviewer for AISTATS 2025. Nominated reviewers are expected to have sufficient expertise in the relevant field. Kindly understand that due to a recent increase of submissions we need more reviewers than previous years.  
 Anonymization Requirements  
 The AISTATS review process is double-blind. All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information that can violate the double-blind reviewing policy, such as the author names or their affiliations, acknowledgements, or links that can infer any author’s identity or institution. Self-citations are allowed as long as anonymity is preserved. It is up to the author’s discretion how best to preserve anonymity when including self-citations. Possibilities include: leaving out a self-citation, including it but replacing the citation text with “removed for anonymous submission,” or leaving the citation as-is. We recommend leaving in a moderate number of self-citations for published or otherwise well-known work.  
 We suggest the authors refrain from advertising the preprint on social media or in the press while under submission to AISTATS. Preprints must not be explicitly identified as an AISTATS submission at any time during the review period (i.e., from the abstract submission deadline until the communication of the accept/reject decision).  
 Dual Submissions  
 Submitted manuscripts should not have been previously published in a journal or in the proceedings of a conference, and should not be under consideration for publication at another conference at any point during the AISTATS review process. Submissions as extended abstracts (4 pages or less), to workshops or non-archival venues (without a proceedings), or to arXiv, will not be considered a concurrent submission. It is acceptable to have a substantially extended version of the submitted paper under consideration simultaneously for journal publication, so long as the journal version’s planned publication date is in May 2025 or later and the journal submission does not interfere with AISTATS’ right to publish the paper. Authors are also allowed to give talks on the work(s) submitted to AISTATS during the review, but these talks should not identify papers as AISTATS submissions.  
 Reviewers will be instructed that tech reports (including reports on sites such as arXiv) and papers in workshops without archival proceedings do not count as prior publication.  
 All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference either as contributed talks or as posters, and will be published in the AISTATS Conference Proceedings in the Journal of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings series. Papers for talks and posters will be treated equally in publication.  
 Confidentiality  
 The reviewers and area-chairs of your paper will have access to your paper and supplementary material. In addition, the program chairs and workflow chairs will have access to all the papers. Everyone having access to papers and supplementary materials will be instructed to keep them confidential during the review process and delete them after the final decisions.  
 Reviews will be visible to area chairs, program chairs, and workflow chairs throughout the process. Reviewers will get access to other reviews for a paper after they have submitted their own review.  
 Author names will be visible to program chairs and workflow chairs. Reviewers and area chairs will not know the author names at any stage of the process. Reviewer names are visible to the area chairs, workflow chairs, and program chairs.  
 Use of Large Language Models and Image Deep Generative Models  
 Regarding the use of Large Language Models (LLMs like GPT-4) and/or large image deep generative models (image DGMs such as StableDiffusion) for AISTATS submissions:  
 LLMs and image DGMs are not allowed for the following use cases:  
 Fully automatically generating text of more than one page, unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. 
  Generating quantitative figures (such as learning curves), unless the produced images are presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. 
  Other potential use cases of LLMs such as polishing text (e.g., paragraph-wise prompted by a manually-written paragraph of content) are not banned.  
 Even with the usage of LLMs and DGMs, it is still the authors’ responsibility to ensure the quality, correctness, and originality of their submission(s). We ask the authors to respect the academic publishing process and ensure their submission(s) do not constitute scientific misconduct (e.g., plagiarism deceptive figures, dual submissions, etc.).  
 If a paper with LLM-generated text and/or large DGM-generated images (except for experimental analysis purposes) has been accepted to the conference, we will require the authors to disclose this information to the Program Chairs before the camera-ready submission. If the Program Chairs are in doubt about potential scientific misconduct, then the submission(s) in question will be tested through checks for e.g,. plagiarism and/or other forms of misconduct. Those submissions violating AISTATS submission policies will be rejected from publication even after the reviewing process.
