 7th International Cross Domain Conference for  
  Machine Learning & Knowledge Extraction (CD-MAKE 2023)   
 CD-MAKE 2023 Call for Papers (Call for Papers.txt)   
 CD-MAKE  is a joint effort of IFIP TC 5, TC 12, IFIP WG 8.4, WG 8.9 and WG 12.9 and is held in conjunction with the 18th International Conference on Availability, Reliability & Security, ARES 2023   
 Machine learning and Knowledge Extraction (MAKE)  is the workhorse of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Successful human-centered AI needs a concerted effort without boundaries, supporting collaborative and integrative cross-disciplinary research between experts cross-domain.  
 The goal of the CD-MAKE conference is to act as a catalysator, to bring together academia and industry in a cross-disciplinary manner, to stimulate fresh ideas and to support human-centered AI:  
 1) DATA – data fusion, preprocessing, mapping, knowledge representation, environments, etc.  
  2) LEARNING – algorithms, contextual adaptation, causal reasoning, transfer learning, etc.  
  3) VISUALIZATION – intelligent interfaces, human-AI interaction, dialogue systems, explanation interfaces, etc.  
  4) PRIVACY – data protection, safety, security, reliability, verifiability, trust, ethics and social issues, etc.  
  5) NETWORK – graphical models, graph-based machine learning, Bayesian inference, etc.  
  6) TOPOLOGY – geometrical machine learning, topological and manifold learning, etc.  
  7) ENTROPY – time and machine learning, entropy-based learning, etc.  
  8) Digital Transformation for smart farm and forest operations  
  9) Perspectivist Learning  
  10) Uncertainty Management and Quantification in ML

  ARES Conference 

 About CD-MAKE  
  
 The International Cross Domain Conference for Machine Learning & Knowledge Extraction CD-MAKE  is a joint effort of IFIP TC 5 (Information Technology Applictions)  , TC 12 (Artificial Intelligence)  , IFIP WG 8.4 (E-Business: Multi-disciplinary research and practice)  , IFIP WG 8.9 (Enterprise Information Systems)  and IFIP WG 12.9 (Computational Intelligence)  and is held in conjunction with the International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES)  .  
 CD  stands for C  ross- D  omain and means the integration and appraisal of different fields and application domains (e.g. health AI, Industry 4.0, etc.) to provide an atmosphere to foster different perspectives and opinions. The conference is dedicated to offer an international platform for novel ideas and a fresh look on the methodologies to put crazy ideas into Business for the benefit of the human. Serendipity is a desired effect, and shall cross-fertilize methodologies and transfer of algorithmic developments.  
    
 MAKE  stands for MA  chine Learning & K  nowledge E  xtraction.  
 Machine learning  deals with understanding intelligence for the design and development of algorithms that can learn from data and improve over time. The original definition was “the artificial generation of knowledge from experience”.  The challenge is to discover relevant structural  patterns and/or temporal  patterns (“knowledge”) in such data, which are often hidden and not accessible to a human. Today, machine learning is the fastest growing technical field, having many application domains, e.g. health, Industry 4.0, recommender systems, speech recognition, autonomous driving, etc. The challenge is in decision making under uncertainty, and probabilistic inference enormously influenced artificial intelligence and statistical learning. The inverse probability allows to infer unknowns, learn from data and make predictions to support decision making. Whether in social networks, recommender systems, health or Industry 4.0 applications, the increasingly complex data sets require efficient, useful and useable solutions for knowledge discovery and knowledge extraction.   
 A synergistic combination of methodologies and approaches of two domains offer ideal conditions towards unraveling these challenges and to foster new, efficient and user-friendly machine learning algorithms and knowledge extraction tools: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)  and Knowledge Discovery/Data Mining (KDD)  , aiming at augmenting human intelligence with computational intelligence  and vice versa toward a human-centered AI  approach.  
 Consequently, successful Machine Learning & Knowledge extraction needs a concerted international effort without boundaries, supporting collaborative and integrative cross-disciplinary research between experts from 7 (the magical number seven +/- 0) fields. Holzinger, A., 2017. Introduction to MAchine Learning & Knowledge Extraction (MAKE). Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction  , 1(1), p.1. Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/make1010001  .  
 TOPICS CD-MAKE  
 ❶ DATA – Data science (data fusion, preprocessing, mapping, knowledge representation, …),  
  ❷ LEARNING – algorithms, contextual adaptation, causal reasoning, transfer learning …  
  ❸ VISUALIZATION – intelligent interfaces, human-AI interaction, dialogue systems, …  
  ❹ PRIVACY – data protection, safety, security, ethics, acceptance and social issues of ML, …  
  ❺ NETWORK – graphical models, graph-based ML, Bayesian inference, …  
  ❻ TOPOLOGY – geometrical machine learning, topological and manifold learning, …  
  ❼ ENTROPY – time and machine learning, entropy-based learning, …  
 The goal of the CD-MAKE conference  is to act as a Catalysator  to bring together researchers from these seven areas in an cross-disciplinary manner, to stimulate fresh ideas and to encourage multi-disciplinary problem solving.  
 About IFIP  
 IFIP  – the I  nternational F  ederation for I  nformation P  rocessing  is the leading multi-national, non-governmental, apolitical organization in Information & Communications Technologies and Computer Sciences, is recognized by the United Nations (UN) and was established in the year 1960 under the auspices of the UNESCO as an outcome of the first World Computer Congress held in Paris in 1959.

 About  
 ICFEC 2025  

 The 9th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2025) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in the fields of fog and edge computing. ICFEC 2025 will take place in conjunction with The 25th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2025).  
  
  Fog and edge computing have received much attention by both the research community and the industry in recent years, and are today seen as an alternative to the utilization of cloud-based computational resources. Especially, this is the case in scenarios where large amounts of data are produced in distributed settings, e.g., in the Internet of Things (IoT), where data needs to be processed in (near) real time, or where suboptimal network connectivity hampers the upload of very large amounts of data to the cloud. Use cases for fog and edge computing range from smart factories over smart grids to autonomous vehicles, to name just some examples.  
  
  While tremendous progress has already been made in the research fields of fog and edge computing, there are still numerous challenges which need to be solved. New abstractions and extensions to current programming and storage models are necessary to allow developers to design novel applications that can benefit from massively distributed fog and edge systems. Addressing security, privacy, and trust is of paramount importance while managing the resources and context of mobile, transient and hardware-constrained resources. Fog and edge computing can also help to process very large amounts of data, both for batch processing and data streams. The integration of novel communication protocols and communication patterns with fog and edge computing also brings both new opportunities and unique challenges. Recently, the utilization of fog and edge resources in order to realize distributed machine learning in the form of federated learning has also gained much traction, since it allows to learn from local data without sharing raw data with any centralized entity.  

 Call for Papers  
 Call for Papers: TBD  

 The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice over systems research and emerging domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems that cover different parts of the cloud-edge compute continuum. This covers different computing models, including mist computing, edge computing, multi-access edge computing, fog computing, and mobile cloud computing. Some representative topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Topics  
   
 Data centers and infrastructures along the compute continuum 
  Mobility management along the compute continuum 
  Federated learning and distributed machine learning in and for the compute continuum 
  5G/6G for the compute continuum 
  Middleware and runtime systems for the compute continuum 
  Programming models for the compute continuum 
  Storage and data management platforms along the compute continuum 
    
 Scheduling and resource management for the compute continuum 
  Security, privacy, trust, and provenance issues for the compute continuum 
  Distributed consensus and blockchains in the compute continuum 
  Modeling and simulation for and in the compute continuum 
  Performance monitoring and metering of infrastructures along the compute continuum 
  (Big) Data processing in the compute continuum 
  Energy-efficient computing in the compute continuum

 Who am I (short bio)   
 I received my Ph.D. from Grenoble Institute of Technologies in September 2006 and my M.S. degree from the University of Grenoble in 2003. During my PhD, I suggested a new way to handle I/O requests in multi-application clusters. This proposal led to the aIOLi project, an I/O scheduler framework for HPC file systems. In the meantime, I worked on the NFSp project, a non intrusive implementation of a parallel NFS server. Until these websites will be shutdown, you should find further details (PhD thesis, publications, code documentations) on the aIOLi  's and NFSp  's sites.  
  Between 2006 and 2008, I held a postdoc position at Inria in the framework of the XtreemOS project  EU IP project. During this position, I had been in charge of designing and developing kDFS  (a kernel Distributed File System).  
  I joined the "ASCOLA Research Group  at the Ecole des Mines de Nantes on September 2008 where I worked on distributed cloud computing challenges (see Beyond the Clouds  initiative as well as the FEMDC Working Group  of the OpenStack community). These activities led in part to the creation of the STACK Research Group that I have been leading since November 2017.

 Research Interest   
 Distributed Computing (Cloud/Fog/Edge) 
  Resource management systems 
  (Distributed) Operating Systems 
  Distributed File Systems/Key Value Stores 
  Virtualizations 
  More precisely I investigate the interest of recent programming models (such as event or component programming) in the design of new systems to help administrators and DevOps manage large-scale geo-distributed infrastructures/applications. I'm currently working on two particular challenges leveraging locality as a key point of the design:  
 Proposing new storage layers to reduce the impact of the network at WAN level. 
  Investigating new approaches to deal with geo-distribution aspects without increasing the complexity of the business logic of an application.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)   
 Co-located with PPoPP, HPCA and CC   
 Las Vegas, USA   
 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in Las Vegas, USA. CGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
  CGO now uses two submissions per year.   
  This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.  
  First Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: May 30, 2024

  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)   
 Co-located with PPoPP, HPCA and CC   
 Las Vegas, USA   
 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in Las Vegas, USA. CGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
  CGO now uses two submissions per year.   
  This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.

  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)   
 Co-located with PPoPP, HPCA and CC   
 Las Vegas, USA   
 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in Las Vegas, USA. CGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
  CGO now uses two submissions per year.   
  This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.  
  First Submission Deadline

  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

 Welcome to CHI 2025!   
  
 The ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction.  
 CHI takes place in Yokohama, Japan, at the PACIFICO Yokohama  from 26 April to 1 May 2025, while also supporting remote attendance.  
 The conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. Today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead.  
 The cherry blossom or ‘Sakura’ as depicted in the CHI’25 logo signifies a time of renewal and optimism. The conference takes place in the period of cherry blossom growth and in this environment of optimism and renewal, we wish you will find your IkiCHI.

 Papers  
 You must submit the abstract/metadata by the 5th Sept AoE in order to submit the full paper by the 12th Sept AoE.   
   
 Please submit papers through the Precision Conference Submission Portal    
   
 CHI 2025 papers will follow the same revise & resubmit process from CHI 2024. Authors can read more about the rationale behind CHI 2024’s updates in this post by the CHI 2024 Papers Chairs  .  
   
 Important Facts   
 Revise and Resubmit: | CHI 2025 Papers will continue with a revise and resubmit phase for papers above a certain threshold, where authors have the opportunity to respond to reviewer feedback and improve their paper as part of our | review cycle | . 
  Paper Length: | Concise and succinct writing are strongly encouraged. | There are two paper length categories. The paper length should be counted excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. 
  Short Papers: | Submissions of 5,000 words or less. 
  Standard-Length Papers: | Submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words (about 7,000-8,000 words on average). 
  Submissions with Excessive Length: Submissions of more than 12,000 words will be desk rejected if their length is not justified. | In a very exceptional case, such submissions may be considered for full review, but authors must provide clear strong justification for why submissions are required to be more than 12,000 words. 
  A paper must be stand alone. | All important information to understand the contributions of their work must be in the main paper excluding appendices, videos, and supplemental materials. Reviewers/ACs expect the relevant details to be in the main text of the paper itself. Any extra materials helpful for understanding the work but not necessary (e.g., interview script, coding, additional results, etc.) may be added as an appendix at the end of the main paper, but note that reviewers/ACs are | NOT | required to read the appendices and supplementary materials for review. 
  Accessibility: | Paper submissions are expected to follow the | SIGCHI Guide to an Accessible Submission | . 
  Inclusivity: | Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible. 
  Mandatory Video Presentation: | All accepted authors are required to upload a video presentation by the video presentation deadline, | Thursday, March 13, 2025 | . Note that this deadline for submitting a video presentation is earlier than in 2024. 
  No Video Previews: | Unlike previous years, CHI 2025 has decided NOT to collect video previews (30-second videos to show the core idea of your work), and authors do not need to prepare them. 
    
 Important Dates   
 All times are in Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone. When the deadline is day D  , the last time to submit is when D  ends AoE. Check your local time in AoE.

 ACM Selection Process Category   
 Refereed   
   
 Introduction   
 CHI Papers present excellent original research from all areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). CHI Papers are read and cited worldwide and have a broad impact on the development of HCI theory, method, and practice.  
 Authors must  present accepted papers at the CHI Conference either in person or virtually. Accepted manuscripts appear in the Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  , which appears in the ACM Digital Library  . The ACM supports Gold and Green open access options  , and the papers by corresponding authors from ACM Open  institutions will be published as Gold Open Access.  
 Accepted papers may come from any area of HCI activity: academia or industry; science, engineering, or craft; analysis or design. Acceptance is highly competitive: accepted papers will excel in originality, significance, validity, research quality, and presentation clarity. We are looking forward to seeing your best work!  
   
 ACM’s Publication Policies   
 It is critical that authors review ACM’s publications policies. Please read this separate page  for them.  
   
 Metadata Integrity   
 The abstract/metadata deadline is a hard deadline for listing all author names  ; there are no exceptions  . Changes to the order of authors are allowed only during the Publication-Ready submission phase. The abstract/metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process and author representation  . If any of the authors needs to be added or removed after the abstract/metadata deadline, authors would need to withdraw their submissions/papers.   
 Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the revision period.  
   
 Policy on Use of Large Language Models   
 Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text  . Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post  describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject  papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  
   
 Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   
 Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regards to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans  before submitting.  
   
 Preparing and Submitting Your Paper   
 Step 1. Write Your Paper   
 Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. If you make multiple submissions to CHI 2025 Papers, they must be distinct from each other. Please refer to the | Guide to a Successful Paper Submission | . 
  Please ensure that you use the correct | template | ; a single-column format must be used for the reviewing phase. | Use of different templates or formats may result in desk rejection. 
  Your submission must be anonymized; please ensure that your submission conforms to the | Anonymization Policy | . | Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. 
  Concise and succinct writing are strongly encouraged in any submission. | Short submissions with a length of 5,000 words or less are strongly welcomed. These papers will go through exactly the same review process although reviewers will be encouraged to ensure that evaluation expectations are commensurate with length and contribution size. 
  Authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution. The average length of CHI papers is approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words (two standard deviations above the average) will be desk rejected, except in circumstances where the authors are able to provide a strong justification. Authors may contact the relevant subcommittee chairs for guidance on appropriate justification. Submissions that are clearly not complete research papers (e.g., abstracts, work-in-progress, entire theses, extensive journal articles) will be desk rejected. | Papers, where the length is incommensurate with contributions, will be desk rejected. 
  Your paper must be stand alone. | You may use appendices and/or supplementary materials to share additional information about your work, but all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF. Heavy reliance on appendices and/or supplementary materials can be a ground for rejection including desk rejection. 
  If you have any concurrent submissions to CHI or other venues that are closely related – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field. | Failure to do so will result in desk rejection. | The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on work currently under review at other venues. Please see | ACM guide on prior and simultaneous submissions | . 
  Research Quality: Papers must include enough detail that the research can be reviewed for research quality, given the norms and expectations of the relevant subcommittee (e.g., design papers will be judged as rigorous according to the expectations of the design community, not by the expectations of the computational interaction community). Papers that do not include enough detail to adequately assess research quality may be rejected; | papers that are clearly not situated in relevant research literature may be desk rejected. 
  Reproducibility: Where relevant, authors are strongly encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible. Please refer to the requirements for supplementary materials below. 
  Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. Authors are expected to follow | SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission | . If you have any questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs at | accessibility@chi2025.acm.org | early | in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will have to be reassigned. Note that subcommittees strive to match the best reviewer to each paper – | the best reviewers for the work may not be able to review an inaccessible submission. 
  Inclusivity: Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible; where this is not possible, it should be acknowledged. For example, authors should use gender-inclusive language when developing their papers (see e.g., | HCI Guidelines for Gender Equity and Inclusivity | ) and consider what communities their work is – and is not – supporting, as well as their geographical context. 
  Questions regarding the submission templates can be addressed by the Publications Chairs at | publications@chi2025.acm.org | . All additional questions regarding the paper submissions process should be directed to the Papers Chairs at | papers@chi2025.acm.org | . 
  Step 2. Prepare Supplementary Materials (Optional)   
 All video figures and supplementary material must be anonymized. Non-anonymized supplemental materials will result in desk rejection of the entire submission. 
  Video figures (optional) do not have a specified time limit for the duration, although we recommend staying within 5 minutes. Details are available in the | Guide to Submitting a Video | . 
  Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help reviewers assess your work as well as allow other researchers to replicate your work. Any non-video supplementary material should be submitted as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. 
  Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main submission file. That is, the paper submission must stand on its own without the supplementary material. 
  Step 3. Select a Subcommittee   
 CHI 2025 expects to receive over 4,000 submissions, as it did in 2024. In order to provide high-quality reviews by experts for all submissions, the CHI program committee is divided into topical subcommittees  . When you submit a paper, you can state a preference of up to two subcommittees whose mandates you believe your topic fits into. It is your responsibility to select the subcommittees that offer the best expertise to assess your research, and that you believe will most fully appreciate your contribution. If you are unsure, you can email the subcommittee chairs for advice. The program committee may re-assign submissions to a different subcommittee if neither of the subcommittees selected by the authors possesses adequate expertise in the submission’s topic.  
 Step 4. Complete Submission   
 Make your submission. Authors may submit and edit their materials via | Precision Conference Submission Portal | until the deadlines. The submission system will open for submissions approximately four weeks before the abstract/metadata submission deadline. 
  Abstract/Metadata Submission Deadline: | Authors must submit their title, abstract (150 words max), list of authors, subcommittee selections, and other metadata before this deadline. Only the contact author can edit the submission files. | No new submissions will be allowed after this deadline. Placeholder metadata (e.g. ‘abstract todo’) are not acceptable and will be desk rejected. 
  Listed authors cannot be changed after the abstract/metadata deadline. | No new authors can be added even during the revise and resubmit period or for the camera-ready version. Making changes to the author list can be used to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper, can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers, and can be used to unethical publication practices. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors | including yourself | , and b) that your PCS account email address is valid. | There are no exceptions. 
  Main Paper Deadline: | Authors must submit the pdf of their paper, and related form data, before this deadline. No extensions will be granted. Any submissions showing ‘incomplete’ after the deadline will be deleted. 
  Video and Supplementary Material Deadline: | As described above, authors can submit optional video figures and any other optional supplementary materials before the deadline. 
  Details on the review process itself are described in the Papers Review Process  .  
   
 Upon Acceptance of Your Paper   
 Contact authors of accepted papers will receive instructions  (link tba) on how to prepare and submit a final version by the Publication-Ready Deadline. If the authors are unable to meet these requirements by the Publication-Ready deadline, the Papers Chairs will be notified and may be required to remove the paper from the program. For any issues relating to the publication phase, please contact publications@chi2025.acm.org  .  
 The publication-ready version has to follow the LaTeX and Word templates from ACM. Should you need technical assistance, please direct your technical query to publications@chi2025.acm.org  .  
 Authors will also be required to assign either copyright or license to the ACM or to pay a fee to ACM for Open Access (details about ACM rights management: http://authors.acm.org  , and about the ACM Author-Izer service: http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-service  ). Responsibility for obtaining permissions to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the CHI conference.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.  
   
 Video Presentations   
 All accepted authors are required to upload a video presentation (a presentation video of your accepted work) by the video presentation deadline of Thursday March 13, 2025.  See technical requirements for video content at CHI  as a guidance for preparing a video presentation. Accepted authors will receive the details of video presentations separately.  
 If authors fail to submit their video presentations by the deadline, their accepted work would be withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library.  
 Unlike previous years, CHI 2025 has decided NOT to collect video previews (30-second videos to show the core idea of your work), and authors do not need to prepare them.  
   
 Your Paper at the Conference   
 Authors of accepted papers are required to present their work at CHI 2025, and the presenting author must register for their paper presentations. Those who cannot attend in-person will have the option to present virtually with a virtual registration rate. Further instructions regarding the presentation of the work will be shared closer to the conference dates. If authors fail to participate in presenting their work, their accepted work would be withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library.  
   
 Your Paper After the Conference   
 Accepted papers will be distributed in the CHI Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide. Video presentations of accepted papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.

 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)   
 Co-located with PPoPP, HPCA and CC   
 Las Vegas, USA   
 The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in Las Vegas, USA. CGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.  
  CGO now uses two submissions per year.   
  This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.  
  First Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: May 30, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: July 9-11, 2024 
  Paper Notification: July 22, 2024 
  Second Submission Deadline   
 Paper Submission: September 12, 2024 
  Author Rebuttal Period: October 22 - 24, 2024 
  Paper Notification: November 4, 2024

  Standard research papers must be written in the ACM format  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template), and may have up to 11 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
  Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers   
 CGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.  
 The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.   
  Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.  
 Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.   
 The selection criteria for papers in this category are:  
 Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions. 
  Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered. 
  Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool. 
  Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided. 
  Availability: The tool or compiler should be available for public use. 
  Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice. 
  Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and support the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool. 
  Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 11 pages in the ACM format  , references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. We encourage shorter submissions that give account of how scientific ideas have been incorporated and used in practice.  
  Geographic Diversity and Inclusion   
 Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2025 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2025 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2025 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.  
  Artifact Evaluation   
 The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without artifact evaluation. Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.  
  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
  Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.  

 Submission Information  
   
 Submission Site   
 Papers can be submitted at https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/  .  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:  
 The paper must be original material  that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings. 
  Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5"x11"), single-spaced, double-column pages  , using 10pt or larger font  , not including references. There is no page limit for references  . We strongly encourage the use of the ACM Conference Template  (use the sample-sigplan.tex template). Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5"x11") paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.) 
  Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix. 
  Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review  . Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: | In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch predictor for …. In this paper, we extend their work by …  
 Bibliography  
 [1] Joe Smith, “A Simple Branch Predictor for …,” Proceedings of CGO 2019.  
 [2] Joe Smith, “A More Complicated Branch Predictor for…,” Proceedings of CGO 2019. 
  Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper. 
  Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small. 
  Please number the pages. 
  The paper must be written in English. 
  The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”. 
  The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings. 
  Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site  . Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
  Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper: | Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including: 
  Co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers. 
  Co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers whom you fund. 
  People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the last FIVE years. 
  Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration that has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The PC Chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest  
   This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.

 The Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI). We call this area “player-computer interaction”.  
   Apply to Volunteer Today!    

 October 13-16 2025  
 The goal of CHI PLAY is to highlight and foster discussion of current high quality research in games and HCI as foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference features streams that blend academic research papers, masterclasses, interactive play demos, student game design competition, poster session and industry insights.  
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

  Calls for Hosting CHI PLAY 

 Calls for Hosting CHI PLAY  

 We actively solicit hosts for CHI PLAY. At this time the Steering Committee wishes to solicit bids that are focussed on hosting a hybrid conference, i.e. an in-person conference, though with support for online presentation and engagement as is feasible without compromising the in-person experience.  
  The host proposal process is intended to be as lightweight as possible, allowing the SC to conduct an informed review. The bid does not need to be a “polished” document, but should aim to include among others:  
 Details of the potential city, including typical hotel costs 
  Details of at least one possible venue, including an indication of the cost of hiring the venue for 1 day of workshops and 3 days of the single-track conference (assuming 150-250 on site attendees), and the AV facilities required, and WiFi networking capable of handling 600+ connected devices. This need not be final but indicative of the costs of holding the conference in that location. Additionally, we would appreciate some indication of how any online components of the conference could be supported. 
  Expected potential dates 
  Indications of potential collocation with other synergetic events 
  A possible high-level schedule of the conference, which should be based on recent CHI PLAY conferences. Innovative ideas for other sessions or sub-events are very welcome 
  Short bios of the general chairs and any local chairs or other community members, who have indicated their willingness to serve. Program Chairs for the archival papers/notes track should NOT be specified. The SC will work with the general chairs to choose program chairs after the host is chosen. 
  Potential local sponsors, both public bodies and local companies. 
  It is essential that proposals reflect CHI PLAY’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity (this should be reflected in all aspects of the conference from the choice of general chairs through to the day-to-day running of the conference itself). 
  We strive for attending at different continents. 
  Prospective hosts are encouraged to review the ACM SIG Conference Planning Guide  . As an ACM-sponsored conference, the ACM takes on financial liability (e.g., signing contracts for the venue) and will assist the general chairs with negotiations with a suitable venue as necessary.  
 As with previous conferences, it is crucial to keep the registration costs and other costs associated with attending the conference as low as possible, so that attendance is open to as many people as possible. Please look forcost-effective options for catering and other expected costs and listing low-cost accommodation possibilities.  
 Deadline for proposals for hosting CHI PLAY 2026:  October 13, 2024 – but earlier submissions are welcome. If you are thinking of submitting a proposal but possibly for a later year, please get in touch with the chair of the steering committee, Vero Vanden Abeele, sc-chair@chiplay.org, or any other member of the steering committee. The SC is happy to help advise prospective hosts before a final proposal is submitted.

 The ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. CHI takes place in Yokohama, Japan, at the PACIFICO Yokohama from 26 April to 1 May 2025, while also supporting remote attendance. The conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. Today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead. The cherry blossom or ‘Sakura’ as depicted in the CHI’25 logo signifies a time of renewal and optimism. The conference takes place in the period of cherry blossom growth and in this environment of optimism and renewal, we wish you will find your IkiCHI.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-06-13

  algorithms for discrete optimization (including convex optimization) 
  algorithm engineering 
  Paper Submission and Proceedings   
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most 15 pages, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page.   
 The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. LNCS templates are available here: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  . No changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Submissions should be anonymized according to the double-blind review policy . Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered.   
 Submissions will be through EasyChair (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025   )   
 The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion.   
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed.   
 At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered.   
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission.   
 The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv).   
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members.   
 PC Submissions   
 Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed.   
 Proceedings   
 Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As in previous editions, the proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer LNCS.  
 Best Paper Award   
 Two selected papers will receive the Best Paper Award, sponsored by Springer.   
 Contact Information   
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to Loukas Georgiadis at  loukas@uoi.gr

 The Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI).  
 10 Years of Fun & Play    

 14-17 October 2024  
   
 The goal of CHI PLAY is to highlight and foster discussion of current high quality research in games and HCI as foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference features streams that blend academic research papers, masterclasses, interactive play demos, student game design competition, poster session and industry insights.  
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

 The GAMES track of PACMHCI (CHI PLAY)  welcomes research that furthers an understanding of the player experience, as well as contributions on novel designs or implementations of player-computer interactions, and contributions to the theory of play and games. The GAMES track welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences; however, technical contributions without impact on players or game designers and developers are not within scope.  
  
 SUBMISSIONS  
 The PACMHCI GAMES track is the premier international venue for research in interactive games and play. Papers are published in the ACM Journal PACMHCI, in the GAMES track, and accepted papers are invited to present at the CHI PLAY conference series. We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to interactive play. Submission should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. We invite contributions across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including, but not limited to:  
 Novel input or output technologies for games and play 
  Studies that contribute to our understanding of player experience 
  Innovative game mechanics and playful interactions 
  Theoretical contributions on play and games 
  Accessible and inclusive design 
  Esports, live streaming, and spectator experiences 
  Advances in game user research, game evaluation methods, and methods for conducting games research 
  Psychology of players and typologies of games and players 
  Studies of applied, serious, and persuasive games (e.g., games and play for health, wellbeing, and learning) 
  Gamification and motivational design 
  Virtual and augmented reality in games and play 
  New tools for game creation and co-creation 
  Game analytics and novel visualizations of player experiences 
  Developer experiences and studies of developers 
  Applications of human-centered game AI (e.g., AI for game development or AI to improve player experience) 
  Critical and reflexive approaches to games & play design and experience 
  Industry case studies 
  PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences. Technical contributions without impact on players or other relevant people in the game community, such as moderators, streamers, developers, or designers (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope, nor are systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies), nor are physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components).  
 PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions that are translations of articles published in other languages, so long as the original authors remain, and the paper is clearly identified as a translation with reference to the original paper (in the PCS submission system, not in the anonymized submission draft).  
  
 IMPORTANT FACTS  
 Papers submitted to PACMHCI GAMES will be peer reviewed and provided with one of three decisions: Accept with Minor Revisions, Revise and Resubmit, and Reject. If asked for revisions, authors will have 6 weeks to implement them and submit to a second round of review from the same members of the editorial board and external reviewers. We anticipate that the majority of papers will receive an Accept with Minor Revisions or a Reject decision in the first round, and that only a small number of papers will be carried forward into the Revise and Resubmit process. 
  Papers accepted to PACMHCI GAMES will be invited to present at the CHI PLAY 2024 conference, held in Tampere Finland on Oct 14–17, 2024. 
  IMPORTANT DATES  
 (all times are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth or AoE  )  
  
 February 21, 2024 | Submission deadline 
 April 19, 2024 | Notifications given   
  (accept with minor revisions/revise and resubmit/reject) 
 June 3, 2024 | Revisions due 
 July 5, 2024 | Final notifications given 
 July 24, 2024 | Camera ready deadline

 SUBMISSION PROCESS DETAILS  
 PACMHCI GAMES uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions  . Selection “SIGCHI” as the Society and “CHI PLAY” as the Conference/Journal to make a new submission.  
 Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the ACM Policy on Authorship  including, but not limited to: That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. Related to this policy, listed authors cannot be changed after the paper submission deadline. No new authors can be added during the revise and resubmit phase or for camera-ready publication. Making changes to the author list can be used as a method to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper and can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors including yourself, and b) that your PCS account email address is a valid one.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication (October, 2024), and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in PACMHCI and the ACM Digital Library. Papers may be made available publicly up to two weeks prior to the conference date.  
  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 PACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template found here: https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  , which is available for LaTeX (and Overleaf), and Word.  
 No minimum or maximum page length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words, or about 17-20 pages in the single column ACM Master Article Template, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers that are widely over the typical length (e.g., above 12,000 words) will be examined carefully to ensure that the size of the contribution warrants the length of the paper.  Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.   
  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials, will be desk rejected.  Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, and the Acknowledgement section. Also, check the meta information in papers prepared using Word.  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”  
 PACMHCI GAMES does not have a policy against uploading preprints to preprint servers, such as SSRN or arXiv, before they are submitted for review at the conference.  
  
 REVISION CYCLES AND DECISIONS  
 PACMHCI GAMES will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle:  
 Accept with Minor Revisions:  Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the revisions deadline for verification by the corresponding associate chair.  
 Revise and Resubmit:  Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Authors should submit their revised manuscript at the revision deadline, along with a summary explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same Associate Chair and reviewers for re-review. We anticipate that a smaller number of submissions will be accepted into this category, as compared to Accept with Minor Revisions, and that not all papers that were invited to provide a revised version will be accepted, and invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Reject:  Submissions that receive this decision have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions within the 6-week revision period. Rejected papers are not able to submit a revision to the 2024 edition of PACMHCI GAMES, and will not be invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Desk Reject:  Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of the GAMES track of PACMHCI. The Track Chairs and Editorial Board may Desk Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Papers may be desk rejected for the following reasons:  
 Incomplete, non-anonymized, or concurrent submissions | Incomplete submissions or working drafts of submissions. 
  Non-anonymized submissions. | Leaving the author names in the paper or having a description or an acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g. places where user studies were conducted and specific supporting grant information). 
  Submissions that fail to declare concurrent submissions that are closely related to the submission. | If you have a concurrent submission under review, you must include an anonymized version of that submission as supplementary material. The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on a project described in a paper that is unpublished or currently under review at other venues. 
  Submissions that are flagged for plagiarism. | Make sure you cite your prior publications by following our Anonymization Policy. 
  Submissions that use the wrong format. | All submissions must use the template specified in the Call for Papers. 
  Submissions that are not written in English. 
  Submissions that are very sloppy, e.g., lots of typos, missing references, formatting issues. 
  Submissions in which something is so broken in the paper that makes it impossible to review. 
  Submissions that are clearly out of scope of PACMHCI GAMES. | Technical contributions without impact on people (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope. 
  Systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies) are not within scope. 
  Physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components) are not within scope. 
  A viewpoint or opinion piece that does not fit the contribution types 
  Submissions without sufficient substance or quality to make it through the peer review process | Submissions that are obviously not an academic paper (e.g., patent disclosure, popular press article, a book). 
  Submissions that fail to clearly communicate their contribution, e.g., claim a specific research goal but do not contribute toward it through the presented research. 
  Submissions in which the contribution is much too small given the length of the submitted paper or is considered as a work in progress. 
  Submissions that demonstrate fundamental methodological flaws or do not follow best practices for the applied methods. | Submissions in which the presented analyses are insufficient to validate the stated claims. 
  Submissions too poorly written to be assigned to external reviewers, (e.g., stated contributions are not situated within extant literature or discussed, details are insufficient for reviewers to interpret the methods or findings). 
  Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified before the review process concludes.  
  
 CONTRIBUTION TYPE FOR REVIEW HANDLING  
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary and secondary contribution type of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:  
 Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, qualitative user studies. 
  Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., quantitative user studies, statistical methods, data modelling. 
  Empirical-Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research. 
  Artefact-Technical, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, visualizations, architectures, implementing novel features in existing systems. 
  Artefact-Design, e.g., research through design, envisionments, guidelines, methods, techniques. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning interactive play studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays. 
  Meta-Research, e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE  
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. For example, interview guides, additional illustrations of their designs, or videos that further describe their systems, and to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors should further consider using open access repositories and make their data and other material available when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to upload data, analysis scripts, and method artefacts as supplementary material to be accessed by reviewers during the review process; these materials will not be made public. Please note that all supplementary materials must be anonymized for the review process.  
  
 ACM POLICY ON USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN SUBMISSIONS  
 All authors should be aware of the ACM Policy on Authorship  , which articulates the authorised use of generative AI in submitted works. In particular, it notes that the use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) is permitted, but all authors are responsible for the content created by these tools, the use of the tools must be disclosed (e.g., in the acknowledgements), and the tool cannot be listed as an author of the submission. As such, authors are responsible for plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication or falsification of content and/or references generated through the use of generative AI tools, and could be sanctioned with penalties, such as a publication ban.  
  
 ACM PUBLICATIONS POLICY ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS  
 All authors of full papers conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research, as detailed in the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects,  including:  
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies. 
  To ensure that authors are in compliance with these policies, authors of papers involving human participants will be asked to confirm having read the policy and provide a mandatory description of how participants were selected, what consent processes were followed (i.e., did they consent and if so what they were told), how they were treated, how data sharing was communicated, and any additional ethical considerations.  
  
 VIDEO FIGURES  
 Video figures are mandatory for submissions that draw from custom-built games or systems that are not freely available (e.g., novel systems, interaction techniques, game designs, mechanics, or envisionments). Figures should showcase the game or system comprehensively (i.e., demonstrate core game mechanics or offer a playthrough) so that reviewers can explore all relevant aspects. Please note that this applies to submissions that contribute systems (i.e., artefacts) and those that study systems (i.e., empirical work). Generally, authors of all papers should consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission if appropriate. Videos should be no more than three minutes long.  
  
 PRESENTING AT THE CHI PLAY CONFERENCE  
 Accepted papers will be invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY conference in Fall 2024. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. All presenting authors will also be required to submit an 8-minute video presentation of their paper.

  Now you are ready to begin. You can rename your files if you want. 
   
 Citing Games with Ludographies in CHI PLAY Papers  
 Citing games, whether commercial or academic, has become common in the CHI PLAY community as they represent important scholarly resources for our work. Games are cited to support statements, exemplify abstract ideas, and acknowledge practice; they may also be a form of primary data, on which the research is built. While authors have taken a number of approaches to this, including adding URLs to game websites in brackets, using footnotes, or adding games to their list of references, these have not quite fit; in content, volume, and style. Phoebe O. Toups Dugas started the practice of a “Ludography” in some of her papers several years ago, drawing from the practice of the Game Studies  journal  . We would like to encourage authors to adopt the idea of a Ludography, a special list of game references that comes after the normal list of references in your paper. Submissions are not required to have a Ludography; however, if games are going to be referenced in your paper we would encourage you to help standardize through a Ludography. Regardless of whether or not a ludography is used, it is important to note details of which version of a game was used (often its platform and release date).  
 For the format of referencing games, we will follow the recommendations put forward in the “Citing Games” section of “Author Guidelines” for CHI PLAY 2020 ( https://chiplay.acm.org/2020/guidelines/  ), which has been reproduced below and augmented with additional guidelines.  
 Below we detail the recommended format for citing games and provide a link for Latex support for easily creating Ludographies.  
 Please note:  This is not a requirement for CHI PLAY 2024 for submission or the final version of your papers; only a recommendation. Future CHI PLAY committees may consider adding this as a requirement. For this year, authors may also decide to submit their paper with another format and upon acceptance decide to submit their final version using these guidelines.  
  
 LudograPhies and Citing Games  
 Authors are encouraged to create a game reference list labeled as “Ludography,” wherever appropriate. The Ludography should appear after the typical “References” list at the end of a paper and follow the same general rules as a typical reference list. In-text citations should follow the same format as the typical paper citations but use the “G#” format. For example:  
 … a similar effect to draw the player’s attention can be seen when Mario flashes after getting a star power-up in Super Mario Bros [G1].   
 Word users can follow the guidelines; LaTeX users should use the BibTeX information below. An example of the game reference format follows:  
 Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems. 1994. Super Metroid. Game [SNES]. (18 April 1994). Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.   
 General Pattern (note that for each entry, you should cite a specific version (e.g., platform) for a game): <developer>. <release year>. <game title in italics>. Game [<platform>]. (<game release date in <day> <month> <year> formats>). <publisher name>, <publisher address> (optional) Last played <last played date>.  
 LaTeX / BibTeX users should use the @misc entry type; the data fields should be filled as follows (the running example is at the end):  
 Author: Use the developer or developers of the version being cited. To avoid having the system treat the developer(s) as a first and last name, use curly braces around each developer.  
 Year:  The release year for the version being cited.  
 Title:  The game title, which has to be manually italicized (using \emph).  
 How published:  The word “Game” followed by the platform in square brackets.  
 Day:  The release day, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Month:  The release month, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Note:  The publisher’s name and location, followed optionally by “Last played” and the date last played.  
 Publisher and Address:  The template will not read these (hence the need to enter them as a note).  
 Example:  
 @misc{SM,  
 Address = {Kyoto, Japan},  
 Author = {{Nintendo R\&D1} and {Intelligent Systems}},  
 Day = {18},  
 Howpublished = {Game [SNES]},  
 Month = {April},  
 Note = {Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.},  
 Publisher = {Nintendo},  
 Title = {\emph{Super Metroid}},  
 Year = {1994}  
 }  
 Latex Support for Creating Ludographies  
 To support the practice of creating Ludographies, Josh Aaron Miller and Kutub Gandhi have thoughtfully created a GitHub repository and instructions for creating a Ludography following these guidelines. See Josh’s repository for instructions on how to use it:  
 LaTeX Ludography Package   
 This approach relies on a Latex package called multibib  , which allows creating multiple bibliographies in the same document. As of writing, TAPS (The ACM Publishing System) has not added multibib to their list of “ Accepted Latex Packages  ,” but they have assured us that it is an accepted package and practice.  
 If you have any questions about citing games with ludographies in your CHI PLAY papers, Please feel free to email the paper chairs (papers@chiplay.acm.org).

That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. Related to this policy, listed authors cannot be changed after the paper submission deadline. No new authors can be added during the revise and resubmit phase or for camera-ready publication. Making changes to the author list can be used as a method to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper and can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors including yourself, and b) that your PCS account email address is a valid one.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication (October, 2024), and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in PACMHCI and the ACM Digital Library. Papers may be made available publicly up to two weeks prior to the conference date.  
  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 PACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template found here: https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  , which is available for LaTeX (and Overleaf), and Word.  
 No minimum or maximum page length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words, or about 17-20 pages in the single column ACM Master Article Template, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers that are widely over the typical length (e.g., above 12,000 words) will be examined carefully to ensure that the size of the contribution warrants the length of the paper.  Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.   
  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials, will be desk rejected.  Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, and the Acknowledgement section. Also, check the meta information in papers prepared using Word.  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”  
 PACMHCI GAMES does not have a policy against uploading preprints to preprint servers, such as SSRN or arXiv, before they are submitted for review at the conference.  
  
 REVISION CYCLES AND DECISIONS  
 PACMHCI GAMES will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle:  
 Accept with Minor Revisions:  Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the revisions deadline for verification by the corresponding associate chair.  
 Revise and Resubmit:  Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Authors should submit their revised manuscript at the revision deadline, along with a summary explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same Associate Chair and reviewers for re-review. We anticipate that a smaller number of submissions will be accepted into this category, as compared to Accept with Minor Revisions, and that not all papers that were invited to provide a revised version will be accepted, and invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Reject:  Submissions that receive this decision have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions within the 6-week revision period. Rejected papers are not able to submit a revision to the 2024 edition of PACMHCI GAMES, and will not be invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Desk Reject:  Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of the GAMES track of PACMHCI. The Track Chairs and Editorial Board may Desk Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Papers may be desk rejected for the following reasons:  
 Incomplete, non-anonymized, or concurrent submissions | Incomplete submissions or working drafts of submissions. 
  Non-anonymized submissions. | Leaving the author names in the paper or having a description or an acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g. places where user studies were conducted and specific supporting grant information). 
  Submissions that fail to declare concurrent submissions that are closely related to the submission. | If you have a concurrent submission under review, you must include an anonymized version of that submission as supplementary material. The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on a project described in a paper that is unpublished or currently under review at other venues. 
  Submissions that are flagged for plagiarism. | Make sure you cite your prior publications by following our Anonymization Policy. 
  Submissions that use the wrong format. | All submissions must use the template specified in the Call for Papers. 
  Submissions that are not written in English. 
  Submissions that are very sloppy, e.g., lots of typos, missing references, formatting issues. 
  Submissions in which something is so broken in the paper that makes it impossible to review. 
  Submissions that are clearly out of scope of PACMHCI GAMES. | Technical contributions without impact on people (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope. 
  Systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies) are not within scope. 
  Physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components) are not within scope. 
  A viewpoint or opinion piece that does not fit the contribution types 
  Submissions without sufficient substance or quality to make it through the peer review process | Submissions that are obviously not an academic paper (e.g., patent disclosure, popular press article, a book). 
  Submissions that fail to clearly communicate their contribution, e.g., claim a specific research goal but do not contribute toward it through the presented research. 
  Submissions in which the contribution is much too small given the length of the submitted paper or is considered as a work in progress. 
  Submissions that demonstrate fundamental methodological flaws or do not follow best practices for the applied methods. | Submissions in which the presented analyses are insufficient to validate the stated claims. 
  Submissions too poorly written to be assigned to external reviewers, (e.g., stated contributions are not situated within extant literature or discussed, details are insufficient for reviewers to interpret the methods or findings). 
  Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified before the review process concludes.  
  
 CONTRIBUTION TYPE FOR REVIEW HANDLING  
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary and secondary contribution type of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:  
 Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, qualitative user studies. 
  Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., quantitative user studies, statistical methods, data modelling. 
  Empirical-Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research. 
  Artefact-Technical, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, visualizations, architectures, implementing novel features in existing systems. 
  Artefact-Design, e.g., research through design, envisionments, guidelines, methods, techniques. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning interactive play studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays. 
  Meta-Research, e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE  
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. For example, interview guides, additional illustrations of their designs, or videos that further describe their systems, and to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors should further consider using open access repositories and make their data and other material available when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to upload data, analysis scripts, and method artefacts as supplementary material to be accessed by reviewers during the review process; these materials will not be made public. Please note that all supplementary materials must be anonymized for the review process.  
  
 ACM POLICY ON USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN SUBMISSIONS  
 All authors should be aware of the ACM Policy on Authorship  , which articulates the authorised use of generative AI in submitted works. In particular, it notes that the use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) is permitted, but all authors are responsible for the content created by these tools, the use of the tools must be disclosed (e.g., in the acknowledgements), and the tool cannot be listed as an author of the submission. As such, authors are responsible for plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication or falsification of content and/or references generated through the use of generative AI tools, and could be sanctioned with penalties, such as a publication ban.  
  
 ACM PUBLICATIONS POLICY ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS  
 All authors of full papers conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research, as detailed in the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects,  including:  
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies. 
  To ensure that authors are in compliance with these policies, authors of papers involving human participants will be asked to confirm having read the policy and provide a mandatory description of how participants were selected, what consent processes were followed (i.e., did they consent and if so what they were told), how they were treated, how data sharing was communicated, and any additional ethical considerations.  
  
 VIDEO FIGURES  
 Video figures are mandatory for submissions that draw from custom-built games or systems that are not freely available (e.g., novel systems, interaction techniques, game designs, mechanics, or envisionments). Figures should showcase the game or system comprehensively (i.e., demonstrate core game mechanics or offer a playthrough) so that reviewers can explore all relevant aspects. Please note that this applies to submissions that contribute systems (i.e., artefacts) and those that study systems (i.e., empirical work). Generally, authors of all papers should consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission if appropriate. Videos should be no more than three minutes long.  
  
 PRESENTING AT THE CHI PLAY CONFERENCE  
 Accepted papers will be invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY conference in Fall 2024. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. All presenting authors will also be required to submit an 8-minute video presentation of their paper.  
  
 OVERLEAF FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS  
 Go to the “Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) – Official Primary Article Templates” in | Overleaf

  Delete the following files: | sample-lualatex.tex 
  sample-sigconf.tex 
  sample-xelatex.tex 
  sample-franklin.png 
  Acmart.pdf 
  Go to the file sample-authordraft.tex | You can rename this file to be clear to you that this is the main file that you will edit. 
  Please use the “review” and “anonymous” styles: \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} | The review option adds line numbers to your paper 
  The anonymous option replaces the authors section for “ANONYMOUS AUTHOR(S)”. In case of anonymous submission, please remember that your submission must be anonymized whether you use this style or not. 
  There are other files that you may delete or replace later: | sample-base.bib: this is a sample bibliography. You can create your own bib file and use it for your references. 
  sample-franklin.png: this is a sample png image. You will delete and replace it later with your proper figures. 
  Now you are ready to begin. You can rename your files if you want. 
   
 Citing Games with Ludographies in CHI PLAY Papers  
 Citing games, whether commercial or academic, has become common in the CHI PLAY community as they represent important scholarly resources for our work. Games are cited to support statements, exemplify abstract ideas, and acknowledge practice; they may also be a form of primary data, on which the research is built. While authors have taken a number of approaches to this, including adding URLs to game websites in brackets, using footnotes, or adding games to their list of references, these have not quite fit; in content, volume, and style. Phoebe O. Toups Dugas started the practice of a “Ludography” in some of her papers several years ago, drawing from the practice of the Game Studies  journal  . We would like to encourage authors to adopt the idea of a Ludography, a special list of game references that comes after the normal list of references in your paper. Submissions are not required to have a Ludography; however, if games are going to be referenced in your paper we would encourage you to help standardize through a Ludography. Regardless of whether or not a ludography is used, it is important to note details of which version of a game was used (often its platform and release date).  
 For the format of referencing games, we will follow the recommendations put forward in the “Citing Games” section of “Author Guidelines” for CHI PLAY 2020 ( https://chiplay.acm.org/2020/guidelines/  ), which has been reproduced below and augmented with additional guidelines.  
 Below we detail the recommended format for citing games and provide a link for Latex support for easily creating Ludographies.  
 Please note:  This is not a requirement for CHI PLAY 2024 for submission or the final version of your papers; only a recommendation. Future CHI PLAY committees may consider adding this as a requirement. For this year, authors may also decide to submit their paper with another format and upon acceptance decide to submit their final version using these guidelines.  
  
 LudograPhies and Citing Games  
 Authors are encouraged to create a game reference list labeled as “Ludography,” wherever appropriate. The Ludography should appear after the typical “References” list at the end of a paper and follow the same general rules as a typical reference list. In-text citations should follow the same format as the typical paper citations but use the “G#” format. For example:  
 … a similar effect to draw the player’s attention can be seen when Mario flashes after getting a star power-up in Super Mario Bros [G1].   
 Word users can follow the guidelines; LaTeX users should use the BibTeX information below. An example of the game reference format follows:  
 Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems. 1994. Super Metroid. Game [SNES]. (18 April 1994). Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.   
 General Pattern (note that for each entry, you should cite a specific version (e.g., platform) for a game): <developer>. <release year>. <game title in italics>. Game [<platform>]. (<game release date in <day> <month> <year> formats>). <publisher name>, <publisher address> (optional) Last played <last played date>.  
 LaTeX / BibTeX users should use the @misc entry type; the data fields should be filled as follows (the running example is at the end):  
 Author: Use the developer or developers of the version being cited. To avoid having the system treat the developer(s) as a first and last name, use curly braces around each developer.  
 Year:  The release year for the version being cited.  
 Title:  The game title, which has to be manually italicized (using \emph).  
 How published:  The word “Game” followed by the platform in square brackets.  
 Day:  The release day, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Month:  The release month, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Note:  The publisher’s name and location, followed optionally by “Last played” and the date last played.  
 Publisher and Address:  The template will not read these (hence the need to enter them as a note).  
 Example:  
 @misc{SM,  
 Address = {Kyoto, Japan},  
 Author = {{Nintendo R\&D1} and {Intelligent Systems}},  
 Day = {18},  
 Howpublished = {Game [SNES]},  
 Month = {April},  
 Note = {Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.},  
 Publisher = {Nintendo},  
 Title = {\emph{Super Metroid}},  
 Year = {1994}  
 }  
 Latex Support for Creating Ludographies  
 To support the practice of creating Ludographies, Josh Aaron Miller and Kutub Gandhi have thoughtfully created a GitHub repository and instructions for creating a Ludography following these guidelines. See Josh’s repository for instructions on how to use it:  
 LaTeX Ludography Package   
 This approach relies on a Latex package called multibib  , which allows creating multiple bibliographies in the same document. As of writing, TAPS (The ACM Publishing System) has not added multibib to their list of “ Accepted Latex Packages  ,” but they have assured us that it is an accepted package and practice.  
 If you have any questions about citing games with ludographies in your CHI PLAY papers, Please feel free to email the paper chairs (papers@chiplay.acm.org).

 Mission Statement and Topics   
 Automata theory is the foundation of computer science. Its applications have spread to almost all areas of computer science and many other disciplines. In addition, there is a growing number of software systems designed to manipulate automata, regular expressions, grammars, and related structures; examples include AGL, AMORE, Automate, FADELA, FinITE, FireLite, FLAP, FSM, Grail, INR, Intex, ASTL, MONA, and Turing's World.  
    
 The purpose of these conferences is to bring together members of the academic, research and industrial community who have an interest in implementation and application of automata to demonstrate and analyze their work and to explain the problems they have been solving.   
  
  We solicit papers and demos on all aspects of implementation and application of automata and related structures, including theoretical aspects, as but not limited to:   

 Complexity of Automata Operations 
  Compilers 
  Computer-aided verification 
  Concurrency 
  Data structure design for automata

  Paper Submission and Proceedings   
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most 15 pages, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page.   
 The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. LNCS templates are available here: https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  . No changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Submissions should be anonymized according to the double-blind review policy . Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered.   
 Submissions will be through EasyChair (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025   )   
 The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion.   
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed.   
 At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered.   
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission.   
 The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv).   
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members.   
 PC Submissions   
 Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed.   
 Proceedings   
 Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As in previous editions, the proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer LNCS.  
 Best Paper Award   
 Two selected papers will receive the Best Paper Award, sponsored by Springer.   
 Contact Information   
 All questions about submissions should be emailed to Loukas Georgiadis at  loukas@uoi.gr

 Full Papers  
  
 The GAMES track of PACMHCI (CHI PLAY)  welcomes research that furthers an understanding of the player experience, as well as contributions on novel designs or implementations of player-computer interactions, and contributions to the theory of play and games. The GAMES track welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences; however, technical contributions without impact on players or game designers and developers are not within scope.  
  
 SUBMISSIONS  
 The PACMHCI GAMES track is the premier international venue for research in interactive games and play. Papers are published in the ACM Journal PACMHCI, in the GAMES track, and accepted papers are invited to present at the CHI PLAY conference series. We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to interactive play. Submission should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. We invite contributions across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including, but not limited to:  
 Novel input or output technologies for games and play 
  Studies that contribute to our understanding of player experience 
  Innovative game mechanics and playful interactions 
  Theoretical contributions on play and games 
  Accessible and inclusive design 
  Esports, live streaming, and spectator experiences 
  Advances in game user research, game evaluation methods, and methods for conducting games research 
  Psychology of players and typologies of games and players 
  Studies of applied, serious, and persuasive games (e.g., games and play for health, wellbeing, and learning) 
  Gamification and motivational design 
  Virtual and augmented reality in games and play 
  New tools for game creation and co-creation 
  Game analytics and novel visualizations of player experiences 
  Developer experiences and studies of developers 
  Applications of human-centered game AI (e.g., AI for game development or AI to improve player experience) 
  Critical and reflexive approaches to games & play design and experience 
  Industry case studies 
  PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences. Technical contributions without impact on players or other relevant people in the game community, such as moderators, streamers, developers, or designers (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope, nor are systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies), nor are physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components).  
 PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions that are translations of articles published in other languages, so long as the original authors remain, and the paper is clearly identified as a translation with reference to the original paper (in the PCS submission system, not in the anonymized submission draft).  
  
 IMPORTANT FACTS  
 Papers submitted to PACMHCI GAMES will be peer reviewed and provided with one of three decisions: Accept with Minor Revisions, Revise and Resubmit, and Reject. If asked for revisions, authors will have 6 weeks to implement them and submit to a second round of review from the same members of the editorial board and external reviewers. We anticipate that the majority of papers will receive an Accept with Minor Revisions or a Reject decision in the first round, and that only a small number of papers will be carried forward into the Revise and Resubmit process. 
  Papers accepted to PACMHCI GAMES will be invited to present at the CHI PLAY 2024 conference, held in Tampere Finland on Oct 14–17, 2024. 
  IMPORTANT DATES  
 (all times are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth or AoE  )  
  
 February 21, 2024 | Submission deadline 
 April 19, 2024 | Notifications given   
  (accept with minor revisions/revise and resubmit/reject) 
 June 3, 2024 | Revisions due 
 July 5, 2024 | Final notifications given 
 July 24, 2024 | Camera ready deadline 
 August 14, 2024 | Video submission deadline 

 SUBMISSION PROCESS DETAILS  
 PACMHCI GAMES uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions  . Selection “SIGCHI” as the Society and “CHI PLAY” as the Conference/Journal to make a new submission.  
 Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the ACM Policy on Authorship  including, but not limited to: That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. Related to this policy, listed authors cannot be changed after the paper submission deadline. No new authors can be added during the revise and resubmit phase or for camera-ready publication. Making changes to the author list can be used as a method to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper and can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors including yourself, and b) that your PCS account email address is a valid one.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication (October, 2024), and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in PACMHCI and the ACM Digital Library. Papers may be made available publicly up to two weeks prior to the conference date.  
  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 PACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template found here: https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  , which is available for LaTeX (and Overleaf), and Word.  
 No minimum or maximum page length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words, or about 17-20 pages in the single column ACM Master Article Template, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers that are widely over the typical length (e.g., above 12,000 words) will be examined carefully to ensure that the size of the contribution warrants the length of the paper.  Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.   
  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials, will be desk rejected.  Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, and the Acknowledgement section. Also, check the meta information in papers prepared using Word.  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”  
 PACMHCI GAMES does not have a policy against uploading preprints to preprint servers, such as SSRN or arXiv, before they are submitted for review at the conference.  
  
 REVISION CYCLES AND DECISIONS  
 PACMHCI GAMES will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle:  
 Accept with Minor Revisions:  Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the revisions deadline for verification by the corresponding associate chair.  
 Revise and Resubmit:  Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Authors should submit their revised manuscript at the revision deadline, along with a summary explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same Associate Chair and reviewers for re-review. We anticipate that a smaller number of submissions will be accepted into this category, as compared to Accept with Minor Revisions, and that not all papers that were invited to provide a revised version will be accepted, and invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Reject:  Submissions that receive this decision have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions within the 6-week revision period. Rejected papers are not able to submit a revision to the 2024 edition of PACMHCI GAMES, and will not be invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Desk Reject:  Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of the GAMES track of PACMHCI. The Track Chairs and Editorial Board may Desk Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Papers may be desk rejected for the following reasons:  
 Incomplete, non-anonymized, or concurrent submissions | Incomplete submissions or working drafts of submissions. 
  Non-anonymized submissions. | Leaving the author names in the paper or having a description or an acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g. places where user studies were conducted and specific supporting grant information). 
  Submissions that fail to declare concurrent submissions that are closely related to the submission. | If you have a concurrent submission under review, you must include an anonymized version of that submission as supplementary material. The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on a project described in a paper that is unpublished or currently under review at other venues. 
  Submissions that are flagged for plagiarism. | Make sure you cite your prior publications by following our Anonymization Policy. 
  Submissions that use the wrong format. | All submissions must use the template specified in the Call for Papers. 
  Submissions that are not written in English. 
  Submissions that are very sloppy, e.g., lots of typos, missing references, formatting issues. 
  Submissions in which something is so broken in the paper that makes it impossible to review. 
  Submissions that are clearly out of scope of PACMHCI GAMES. | Technical contributions without impact on people (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope. 
  Systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies) are not within scope. 
  Physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components) are not within scope. 
  A viewpoint or opinion piece that does not fit the contribution types 
  Submissions without sufficient substance or quality to make it through the peer review process | Submissions that are obviously not an academic paper (e.g., patent disclosure, popular press article, a book). 
  Submissions that fail to clearly communicate their contribution, e.g., claim a specific research goal but do not contribute toward it through the presented research. 
  Submissions in which the contribution is much too small given the length of the submitted paper or is considered as a work in progress. 
  Submissions that demonstrate fundamental methodological flaws or do not follow best practices for the applied methods. | Submissions in which the presented analyses are insufficient to validate the stated claims. 
  Submissions too poorly written to be assigned to external reviewers, (e.g., stated contributions are not situated within extant literature or discussed, details are insufficient for reviewers to interpret the methods or findings). 
  Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified before the review process concludes.  
  
 CONTRIBUTION TYPE FOR REVIEW HANDLING  
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary and secondary contribution type of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:  
 Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, qualitative user studies. 
  Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., quantitative user studies, statistical methods, data modelling. 
  Empirical-Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research. 
  Artefact-Technical, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, visualizations, architectures, implementing novel features in existing systems. 
  Artefact-Design, e.g., research through design, envisionments, guidelines, methods, techniques. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning interactive play studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays. 
  Meta-Research, e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE  
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. For example, interview guides, additional illustrations of their designs, or videos that further describe their systems, and to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors should further consider using open access repositories and make their data and other material available when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to upload data, analysis scripts, and method artefacts as supplementary material to be accessed by reviewers during the review process; these materials will not be made public. Please note that all supplementary materials must be anonymized for the review process.  
  
 ACM POLICY ON USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN SUBMISSIONS  
 All authors should be aware of the ACM Policy on Authorship  , which articulates the authorised use of generative AI in submitted works. In particular, it notes that the use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) is permitted, but all authors are responsible for the content created by these tools, the use of the tools must be disclosed (e.g., in the acknowledgements), and the tool cannot be listed as an author of the submission. As such, authors are responsible for plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication or falsification of content and/or references generated through the use of generative AI tools, and could be sanctioned with penalties, such as a publication ban.  
  
 ACM PUBLICATIONS POLICY ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS  
 All authors of full papers conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research, as detailed in the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects,  including:  
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies. 
  To ensure that authors are in compliance with these policies, authors of papers involving human participants will be asked to confirm having read the policy and provide a mandatory description of how participants were selected, what consent processes were followed (i.e., did they consent and if so what they were told), how they were treated, how data sharing was communicated, and any additional ethical considerations.  
  
 VIDEO FIGURES  
 Video figures are mandatory for submissions that draw from custom-built games or systems that are not freely available (e.g., novel systems, interaction techniques, game designs, mechanics, or envisionments). Figures should showcase the game or system comprehensively (i.e., demonstrate core game mechanics or offer a playthrough) so that reviewers can explore all relevant aspects. Please note that this applies to submissions that contribute systems (i.e., artefacts) and those that study systems (i.e., empirical work). Generally, authors of all papers should consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission if appropriate. Videos should be no more than three minutes long.  
  
 PRESENTING AT THE CHI PLAY CONFERENCE  
 Accepted papers will be invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY conference in Fall 2024. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. All presenting authors will also be required to submit an 8-minute video presentation of their paper.

 Citing Games with Ludographies in CHI PLAY Papers  
 Citing games, whether commercial or academic, has become common in the CHI PLAY community as they represent important scholarly resources for our work. Games are cited to support statements, exemplify abstract ideas, and acknowledge practice; they may also be a form of primary data, on which the research is built. While authors have taken a number of approaches to this, including adding URLs to game websites in brackets, using footnotes, or adding games to their list of references, these have not quite fit; in content, volume, and style. Phoebe O. Toups Dugas started the practice of a “Ludography” in some of her papers several years ago, drawing from the practice of the Game Studies  journal  . We would like to encourage authors to adopt the idea of a Ludography, a special list of game references that comes after the normal list of references in your paper. Submissions are not required to have a Ludography; however, if games are going to be referenced in your paper we would encourage you to help standardize through a Ludography. Regardless of whether or not a ludography is used, it is important to note details of which version of a game was used (often its platform and release date).  
 For the format of referencing games, we will follow the recommendations put forward in the “Citing Games” section of “Author Guidelines” for CHI PLAY 2020 ( https://chiplay.acm.org/2020/guidelines/  ), which has been reproduced below and augmented with additional guidelines.  
 Below we detail the recommended format for citing games and provide a link for Latex support for easily creating Ludographies.  
 Please note:  This is not a requirement for CHI PLAY 2024 for submission or the final version of your papers; only a recommendation. Future CHI PLAY committees may consider adding this as a requirement. For this year, authors may also decide to submit their paper with another format and upon acceptance decide to submit their final version using these guidelines.  
  
 LudograPhies and Citing Games  
 Authors are encouraged to create a game reference list labeled as “Ludography,” wherever appropriate. The Ludography should appear after the typical “References” list at the end of a paper and follow the same general rules as a typical reference list. In-text citations should follow the same format as the typical paper citations but use the “G#” format. For example:  
 … a similar effect to draw the player’s attention can be seen when Mario flashes after getting a star power-up in Super Mario Bros [G1].   
 Word users can follow the guidelines; LaTeX users should use the BibTeX information below. An example of the game reference format follows:  
 Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems. 1994. Super Metroid. Game [SNES]. (18 April 1994). Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.   
 General Pattern (note that for each entry, you should cite a specific version (e.g., platform) for a game): <developer>. <release year>. <game title in italics>. Game [<platform>]. (<game release date in <day> <month> <year> formats>). <publisher name>, <publisher address> (optional) Last played <last played date>.  
 LaTeX / BibTeX users should use the @misc entry type; the data fields should be filled as follows (the running example is at the end):  
 Author: Use the developer or developers of the version being cited. To avoid having the system treat the developer(s) as a first and last name, use curly braces around each developer.  
 Year:  The release year for the version being cited.  
 Title:  The game title, which has to be manually italicized (using \emph).  
 How published:  The word “Game” followed by the platform in square brackets.  
 Day:  The release day, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Month:  The release month, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Note:  The publisher’s name and location, followed optionally by “Last played” and the date last played.  
 Publisher and Address:  The template will not read these (hence the need to enter them as a note).  
 Example:  
 @misc{SM,  
 Address = {Kyoto, Japan},  
 Author = {{Nintendo R\&D1} and {Intelligent Systems}},  
 Day = {18},  
 Howpublished = {Game [SNES]},  
 Month = {April},  
 Note = {Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.},  
 Publisher = {Nintendo},  
 Title = {\emph{Super Metroid}},  
 Year = {1994}  
 }  
 Latex Support for Creating Ludographies  
 To support the practice of creating Ludographies, Josh Aaron Miller and Kutub Gandhi have thoughtfully created a GitHub repository and instructions for creating a Ludography following these guidelines. See Josh’s repository for instructions on how to use it:  
 LaTeX Ludography Package   
 This approach relies on a Latex package called multibib  , which allows creating multiple bibliographies in the same document. As of writing, TAPS (The ACM Publishing System) has not added multibib to their list of “ Accepted Latex Packages  ,” but they have assured us that it is an accepted package and practice.  
 If you have any questions about citing games with ludographies in your CHI PLAY papers, Please feel free to email the paper chairs (papers@chiplay.acm.org).

 The GAMES track of PACMHCI (CHI PLAY)  welcomes research that furthers an understanding of the player experience, as well as contributions on novel designs or implementations of player-computer interactions, and contributions to the theory of play and games. The GAMES track welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences; however, technical contributions without impact on players or game designers and developers are not within scope.  
  
 SUBMISSIONS  
 The PACMHCI GAMES track is the premier international venue for research in interactive games and play. Papers are published in the ACM Journal PACMHCI, in the GAMES track, and accepted papers are invited to present at the CHI PLAY conference series. We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to interactive play. Submission should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. We invite contributions across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including, but not limited to:  
 Novel input or output technologies for games and play 
  Studies that contribute to our understanding of player experience 
  Innovative game mechanics and playful interactions 
  Theoretical contributions on play and games 
  Accessible and inclusive design 
  Esports, live streaming, and spectator experiences 
  Advances in game user research, game evaluation methods, and methods for conducting games research 
  Psychology of players and typologies of games and players 
  Studies of applied, serious, and persuasive games (e.g., games and play for health, wellbeing, and learning) 
  Gamification and motivational design 
  Virtual and augmented reality in games and play 
  New tools for game creation and co-creation 
  Game analytics and novel visualizations of player experiences 
  Developer experiences and studies of developers 
  Applications of human-centered game AI (e.g., AI for game development or AI to improve player experience) 
  Critical and reflexive approaches to games & play design and experience 
  Industry case studies 
  PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions on the effects of various technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences. Technical contributions without impact on players or other relevant people in the game community, such as moderators, streamers, developers, or designers (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope, nor are systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies), nor are physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components).  
 PACMHCI GAMES welcomes contributions that are translations of articles published in other languages, so long as the original authors remain, and the paper is clearly identified as a translation with reference to the original paper (in the PCS submission system, not in the anonymized submission draft).  
  
 IMPORTANT FACTS  
 Papers submitted to PACMHCI GAMES will be peer reviewed and provided with one of three decisions: Accept with Minor Revisions, Revise and Resubmit, and Reject. If asked for revisions, authors will have 6 weeks to implement them and submit to a second round of review from the same members of the editorial board and external reviewers. We anticipate that the majority of papers will receive an Accept with Minor Revisions or a Reject decision in the first round, and that only a small number of papers will be carried forward into the Revise and Resubmit process. 
  Papers accepted to PACMHCI GAMES will be invited to present at the CHI PLAY 2024 conference, held in Tampere Finland on Oct 14–17, 2024. 
  IMPORTANT DATES  
 (all times are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth or AoE  )  
  
 February 21, 2024 | Submission deadline 
 April 19, 2024 | Notifications given   
  (accept with minor revisions/revise and resubmit/reject) 
 June 3, 2024 | Revisions due

 SUBMISSION PROCESS DETAILS  
 PACMHCI GAMES uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions  . Selection “SIGCHI” as the Society and “CHI PLAY” as the Conference/Journal to make a new submission.  
 Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the ACM Policy on Authorship  including, but not limited to: That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. Related to this policy, listed authors cannot be changed after the paper submission deadline. No new authors can be added during the revise and resubmit phase or for camera-ready publication. Making changes to the author list can be used as a method to manipulate the selected reviewers of a paper and can introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors including yourself, and b) that your PCS account email address is a valid one.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication (October, 2024), and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in PACMHCI and the ACM Digital Library. Papers may be made available publicly up to two weeks prior to the conference date.  
  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 PACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template found here: https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  , which is available for LaTeX (and Overleaf), and Word.  
 No minimum or maximum page length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words, or about 17-20 pages in the single column ACM Master Article Template, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers that are widely over the typical length (e.g., above 12,000 words) will be examined carefully to ensure that the size of the contribution warrants the length of the paper.  Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.   
  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials, will be desk rejected.  Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, and the Acknowledgement section. Also, check the meta information in papers prepared using Word.  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”  
 PACMHCI GAMES does not have a policy against uploading preprints to preprint servers, such as SSRN or arXiv, before they are submitted for review at the conference.  
  
 REVISION CYCLES AND DECISIONS  
 PACMHCI GAMES will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle:  
 Accept with Minor Revisions:  Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the revisions deadline for verification by the corresponding associate chair.  
 Revise and Resubmit:  Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Authors should submit their revised manuscript at the revision deadline, along with a summary explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same Associate Chair and reviewers for re-review. We anticipate that a smaller number of submissions will be accepted into this category, as compared to Accept with Minor Revisions, and that not all papers that were invited to provide a revised version will be accepted, and invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Reject:  Submissions that receive this decision have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions within the 6-week revision period. Rejected papers are not able to submit a revision to the 2024 edition of PACMHCI GAMES, and will not be invited to present at CHI PLAY 2024.  
 Desk Reject:  Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of the GAMES track of PACMHCI. The Track Chairs and Editorial Board may Desk Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Papers may be desk rejected for the following reasons:  
 Incomplete, non-anonymized, or concurrent submissions | Incomplete submissions or working drafts of submissions. 
  Non-anonymized submissions. | Leaving the author names in the paper or having a description or an acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution (e.g. places where user studies were conducted and specific supporting grant information). 
  Submissions that fail to declare concurrent submissions that are closely related to the submission. | If you have a concurrent submission under review, you must include an anonymized version of that submission as supplementary material. The same rule applies if your submission is built directly on a project described in a paper that is unpublished or currently under review at other venues. 
  Submissions that are flagged for plagiarism. | Make sure you cite your prior publications by following our Anonymization Policy. 
  Submissions that use the wrong format. | All submissions must use the template specified in the Call for Papers. 
  Submissions that are not written in English. 
  Submissions that are very sloppy, e.g., lots of typos, missing references, formatting issues. 
  Submissions in which something is so broken in the paper that makes it impossible to review. 
  Submissions that are clearly out of scope of PACMHCI GAMES. | Technical contributions without impact on people (e.g., Procedural Content Generation for game levels without considering the human experience) are not within scope. 
  Systems without a gameful or playful component (e.g., basic VR studies) are not within scope. 
  Physical games without a digital element (e.g., board or tabletop gaming without digital components) are not within scope. 
  A viewpoint or opinion piece that does not fit the contribution types 
  Submissions without sufficient substance or quality to make it through the peer review process | Submissions that are obviously not an academic paper (e.g., patent disclosure, popular press article, a book). 
  Submissions that fail to clearly communicate their contribution, e.g., claim a specific research goal but do not contribute toward it through the presented research. 
  Submissions in which the contribution is much too small given the length of the submitted paper or is considered as a work in progress. 
  Submissions that demonstrate fundamental methodological flaws or do not follow best practices for the applied methods. | Submissions in which the presented analyses are insufficient to validate the stated claims. 
  Submissions too poorly written to be assigned to external reviewers, (e.g., stated contributions are not situated within extant literature or discussed, details are insufficient for reviewers to interpret the methods or findings). 
  Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified before the review process concludes.  
  
 CONTRIBUTION TYPE FOR REVIEW HANDLING  
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary and secondary contribution type of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:  
 Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, qualitative user studies. 
  Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., quantitative user studies, statistical methods, data modelling. 
  Empirical-Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research. 
  Artefact-Technical, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, visualizations, architectures, implementing novel features in existing systems. 
  Artefact-Design, e.g., research through design, envisionments, guidelines, methods, techniques. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning interactive play studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays. 
  Meta-Research, e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE  
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. For example, interview guides, additional illustrations of their designs, or videos that further describe their systems, and to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors should further consider using open access repositories and make their data and other material available when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to upload data, analysis scripts, and method artefacts as supplementary material to be accessed by reviewers during the review process; these materials will not be made public. Please note that all supplementary materials must be anonymized for the review process.  
  
 ACM POLICY ON USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN SUBMISSIONS  
 All authors should be aware of the ACM Policy on Authorship  , which articulates the authorised use of generative AI in submitted works. In particular, it notes that the use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) is permitted, but all authors are responsible for the content created by these tools, the use of the tools must be disclosed (e.g., in the acknowledgements), and the tool cannot be listed as an author of the submission. As such, authors are responsible for plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication or falsification of content and/or references generated through the use of generative AI tools, and could be sanctioned with penalties, such as a publication ban.  
  
 ACM PUBLICATIONS POLICY ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS  
 All authors of full papers conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research, as detailed in the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects,  including:  
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies. 
  To ensure that authors are in compliance with these policies, authors of papers involving human participants will be asked to confirm having read the policy and provide a mandatory description of how participants were selected, what consent processes were followed (i.e., did they consent and if so what they were told), how they were treated, how data sharing was communicated, and any additional ethical considerations.  
  
 VIDEO FIGURES  
 Video figures are mandatory for submissions that draw from custom-built games or systems that are not freely available (e.g., novel systems, interaction techniques, game designs, mechanics, or envisionments). Figures should showcase the game or system comprehensively (i.e., demonstrate core game mechanics or offer a playthrough) so that reviewers can explore all relevant aspects. Please note that this applies to submissions that contribute systems (i.e., artefacts) and those that study systems (i.e., empirical work). Generally, authors of all papers should consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission if appropriate. Videos should be no more than three minutes long.  
  
 PRESENTING AT THE CHI PLAY CONFERENCE  
 Accepted papers will be invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY conference in Fall 2024. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. All presenting authors will also be required to submit an 8-minute video presentation of their paper.

  Now you are ready to begin. You can rename your files if you want. 
   
 Citing Games with Ludographies in CHI PLAY Papers  
 Citing games, whether commercial or academic, has become common in the CHI PLAY community as they represent important scholarly resources for our work. Games are cited to support statements, exemplify abstract ideas, and acknowledge practice; they may also be a form of primary data, on which the research is built. While authors have taken a number of approaches to this, including adding URLs to game websites in brackets, using footnotes, or adding games to their list of references, these have not quite fit; in content, volume, and style. Phoebe O. Toups Dugas started the practice of a “Ludography” in some of her papers several years ago, drawing from the practice of the Game Studies  journal  . We would like to encourage authors to adopt the idea of a Ludography, a special list of game references that comes after the normal list of references in your paper. Submissions are not required to have a Ludography; however, if games are going to be referenced in your paper we would encourage you to help standardize through a Ludography. Regardless of whether or not a ludography is used, it is important to note details of which version of a game was used (often its platform and release date).  
 For the format of referencing games, we will follow the recommendations put forward in the “Citing Games” section of “Author Guidelines” for CHI PLAY 2020 ( https://chiplay.acm.org/2020/guidelines/  ), which has been reproduced below and augmented with additional guidelines.  
 Below we detail the recommended format for citing games and provide a link for Latex support for easily creating Ludographies.  
 Please note:  This is not a requirement for CHI PLAY 2024 for submission or the final version of your papers; only a recommendation. Future CHI PLAY committees may consider adding this as a requirement. For this year, authors may also decide to submit their paper with another format and upon acceptance decide to submit their final version using these guidelines.  
  
 LudograPhies and Citing Games  
 Authors are encouraged to create a game reference list labeled as “Ludography,” wherever appropriate. The Ludography should appear after the typical “References” list at the end of a paper and follow the same general rules as a typical reference list. In-text citations should follow the same format as the typical paper citations but use the “G#” format. For example:  
 … a similar effect to draw the player’s attention can be seen when Mario flashes after getting a star power-up in Super Mario Bros [G1].   
 Word users can follow the guidelines; LaTeX users should use the BibTeX information below. An example of the game reference format follows:  
 Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems. 1994. Super Metroid. Game [SNES]. (18 April 1994). Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.   
 General Pattern (note that for each entry, you should cite a specific version (e.g., platform) for a game): <developer>. <release year>. <game title in italics>. Game [<platform>]. (<game release date in <day> <month> <year> formats>). <publisher name>, <publisher address> (optional) Last played <last played date>.  
 LaTeX / BibTeX users should use the @misc entry type; the data fields should be filled as follows (the running example is at the end):  
 Author: Use the developer or developers of the version being cited. To avoid having the system treat the developer(s) as a first and last name, use curly braces around each developer.  
 Year:  The release year for the version being cited.  
 Title:  The game title, which has to be manually italicized (using \emph).  
 How published:  The word “Game” followed by the platform in square brackets.  
 Day:  The release day, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Month:  The release month, if known, for the version being cited.  
 Note:  The publisher’s name and location, followed optionally by “Last played” and the date last played.  
 Publisher and Address:  The template will not read these (hence the need to enter them as a note).  
 Example:  
 @misc{SM,  
 Address = {Kyoto, Japan},  
 Author = {{Nintendo R\&D1} and {Intelligent Systems}},  
 Day = {18},  
 Howpublished = {Game [SNES]},  
 Month = {April},  
 Note = {Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan. Last played August 2011.},  
 Publisher = {Nintendo},  
 Title = {\emph{Super Metroid}},  
 Year = {1994}  
 }  
 Latex Support for Creating Ludographies  
 To support the practice of creating Ludographies, Josh Aaron Miller and Kutub Gandhi have thoughtfully created a GitHub repository and instructions for creating a Ludography following these guidelines. See Josh’s repository for instructions on how to use it:  
 LaTeX Ludography Package   
 This approach relies on a Latex package called multibib  , which allows creating multiple bibliographies in the same document. As of writing, TAPS (The ACM Publishing System) has not added multibib to their list of “ Accepted Latex Packages  ,” but they have assured us that it is an accepted package and practice.

  This book presents samples of IT activities in the period 2002-2007, in plain language for a nonspecialist reader was adopted throughout. This is certainly an ambitious objective, not only because of the very nature of the activities, mostly research and development, but also because of its scope, that encompasses, and in some cases goes beyond, the already broad field of telecommunications.  
   
  Key performance indicators show the trend, existing laboratory facilities set the boundaries, and short descriptions of about 80 projects and research topics, chosen from a much larger set, provide compelling examples of IT activity in line with its mission “to create and disseminate scientific knowledge in the field of telecommunications“.

  Instituto de Telecomunicações (it) has grown fast to become a quite large research institution in Portugal with more than 400 researchers distributed by 8 sites and branches across the country and activities spanning a very broad range of topics in telecommunications and supporting sciences and technologies.  
   
  A major challenge has been to use this diversity as an opportunity for it to become more than the sum of its parts, by enhancing internal cooperation between sites and groups and exploiting existing and potential synergies to the full. To pursue this goal, it issued in June 2008 an internal call for two-year interdisciplinary projects that had to involve at least two different research groups. The call closed on July 14, 2008 and received 36 proposals (4 were considered not eligible). The 32 eligible proposals were evaluated by international experts that rated them as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor. All Excellent and Very Good proposals (15) were funded for a total amount of 600 k€.  
   
  Activities in it internal projects involved 100 researchers from 22 groups and originated 16 prototypes, about 40 journal papers, and 45 PhD and MSc dissertations. In a few projects, the quality and innovation of the results fueled contacts with interested external national and international partners. We are convinced that, in addition to their own scientific and technological merits, these projects provided an important contribution to strengthen internal collaboration and to  
  achieve excellence in telecommunications, which is in the essence of it mission.

  As it is growing, a major challenge has been to use this diversity as an opportunity for it to become more than the sum of its parts, by enhancing internal cooperation between sites and groups exploiting existing and potential synergies to the full. To pursue this goal and profiting from the experience gained in our second call for two year interdisciplinary projects that had to involve at least two different research groups, launched in 2008, it issued in January 2011 a third call for internal projects that closed on the 27th of February 2011 and received 40 proposals. All proposals were evaluated by international experts that rated them as Excellent, Very Good, Good Fair or Poor. All proposals rated as Excellent and Very Good, (21) were funded for a total amount of 721 k€.  
   
  Activities in it internal projects involved 100 researchers from 23 groups and originated 21 prototypes, about 74 journal papers, and 60 PhD and MSc dissertations. In a few projects, the quality and innovation of the results fueled contacts with interested external national and international partners. We are convinced that, in addition to their own scientific and technological merits, these projects provided an important contribution to strengthen internal collaboration and to achieve excellence in telecommunications, which is in the essence of it mission.

To pursue this goal and profiting from the experience gained in our previous calls, launched in 2008 and 2010 for two-year interdisciplinary  
  projects that had to involve at least two different research groups, it issued in September 2013 a fourth call for internal projects that closed on the 3rd of November 2013 and received 83 proposals.  
  All proposals were evaluated by international experts that rated them as Excellent, Very Good, Good Fair or Poor. All proposals rated as Excellent and Very Good, (25) were funded for a total amount of 893 k€.  
  These projects, which are described ahead, fill an important gap in the existing FCT funding schemes that tend to favor small, monochromatic research teams. Activities in it’s internal projects involved 170 it researchers from 28 groups and originated 40 prototypes, about 109 journal papers, and 102 PhD and MSc dissertations.  
  In a few projects, the quality and innovation of the results fueled contacts and new projects with interested external national and international partners.

 The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion.  
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered.  
 *Double-Blind Reviewing* CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission.  
 The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv).  
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members.  
 *PC Submissions* Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed.

  How are ratings calculated?   To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzes reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 Submission Details  
 COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references) papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix. Authors should follow the general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings  , which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.  
 To prepare your submission, please make sure to use the COLING 2025 style files available here:  
 LaTeX 
  Word 
  Overleaf 
  Papers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review.   
 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).  
  
 Deadline for direct submissions | September 16, 2024 
 Commitment deadline for ARR papers | October 20, 2024 
 Author rebuttal phase (for direct submissions) | October 30 - November 1, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance for COLING 2025 | November 29, 2024 
 Camera-ready papers due | December 15, 2024 
 Tutorials and Workshops | January 19-20, 2025 
 Main Conference | January 21-24, 2025 
  
 Anonymity Period  
 COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

  Papers targeting any of these topics from the perspective of the Sustainability Goals of the UN are especially welcome.  
 Submission Details  
 COLING 2025 invites the submission of long papers of up to eight pages and short papers of up to four pages. These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references) papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix. Authors should follow the general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings  , which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.  
 To prepare your submission, please make sure to use the COLING 2025 style files available here:  
 LaTeX 
  Word 
  Overleaf 
  Papers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review.   
 COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.  
 There are two routes for paper submission:  
 Direct submission  
 Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START  using the following link: https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/   
 Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal to clarify any misunderstandings. The review process will be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, authors will not see reviewers. Reviews and submissions will not be made publicly visible.  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers  
 Papers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.  
 For additional information, please see the FAQ for submissions.    
 ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START  . When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data  
 Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz  or .zip  archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets. COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results. For the main track, the supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions, model parameters or proofs should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Note that submissions need to remain fully self-contained. In particular, any details that are important for reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work should be included in the main body of the paper.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00  (“anywhere on Earth”).

 Anonymity Period  
 COLING 2025 will follow the ACL Anonymity Policy. As a result, no anonymity period will be required, although authors are still cautioned against extensive advertising. The submissions themselves must still be fully anonymized.  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Papers which are submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time. The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. Authors can either commit their paper through ARR or directly submit it to the conference. Papers reviewed and committed to the conference through ARR cannot be submitted directly to the conference. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.
