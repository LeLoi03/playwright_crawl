 The Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) invites you to submit your research for presentation at our 12th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), which will be held in Glasgow, UK, September 16-18, 2024.  
 The Conference series on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore (conditional on the approval by IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2024 will be invited to submit extended versions to the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing  .  
 The theme for ACII 2024 is Human and Beyond  (e.g., animals, virtual agents, and robots). The goal is to move from interaction settings involving only humans, the most common topic in Affective Computing, to more general scenarios in which multiple types of agents (natural and artificial) share a common social landscape and seamlessly participate in efficient and effective interactions.  
 The conference will be co-located with IVA ( Intelligent Virtual Agent Conference  ), 2024.

 Overview  
 ACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 February cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 February cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to ACL 2025 via the conference commitment site (TBA).  
 Submission Topics  
 ACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):  
 Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics 
  Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
  Discourse and Pragmatics 
  Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP 
  Ethics, Bias, and Fairness 
  Generation 
  Human-Centered NLP 
  Information Extraction

  Special Theme | : Generalization of NLP Models 
  ACL 2025 Theme Track: Generalization of NLP Models  
 Following the success of the ACL 2020-2024 Theme tracks, we are happy to announce that ACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP.  
 Generalization is crucial for ensuring that models behave robustly, reliably, and fairly when making predictions on data different from their training data. Achieving good generalization is critically important for models used in real-world applications, as they should emulate human-like behavior. Humans are known for their ability to generalize well, and models should aspire to this standard.  
 The theme track invites empirical and theoretical research and position and survey papers reflecting on the Generalization of NLP Models. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:  
 How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness? 
  What factors affect the generalization of NLP models? 
  What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models? 
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard? 
  The theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session for this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards.  
 Two-Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to ACL 2025  
 ACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review  (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review  platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., ACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
  ACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with *CL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload  
 As the pace of research in the field continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here. As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.  
 Important Dates  
 Submission deadline (all papers are submitted to ARR) | : February 15, 2025 
  ARR reviews & meta-reviews available to authors of the February cycle | : April 15, 2025 
  Commitment deadline for ACL 2025 | : April 20, 2025

  Note: All deadlines are at 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).   
 Paper Submission Details  
 Both long and short paper submissions should follow all of the ARR submission requirements  , including:  
 Long Papers | (8 pages) and | Short Papers | (4 pages) 
  Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review 
  Authorship 
  Citation and Comparison 
  Multiple Submission Policy | , | Resubmission Policy | , and | Withdrawal Policy 
  Ethics Policy | including the | responsible NLP research checklist 
  Limitations 
  Paper Submission and Templates 
  Optional Supplementary Materials | Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments. 
  Following the ACL and ARR policies  , there is no anonymity period requirement.   
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected ACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to ACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than ACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to ACL 2025.  
 Presentation at the Conference  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection. Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.

 Both long and short paper submissions should follow all of the ARR submission requirements  , including:  
 Long Papers | (8 pages) and | Short Papers | (4 pages) 
  Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review 
  Authorship 
  Citation and Comparison 
  Multiple Submission Policy | , | Resubmission Policy | , and | Withdrawal Policy

  Limitations 
  Paper Submission and Templates 
  Optional Supplementary Materials | Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments. 
  Following the ACL and ARR policies  , there is no anonymity period requirement.   
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected ACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to ACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than ACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to ACL 2025.  
 Presentation at the Conference  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection. Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.

   ACL Rolling Review   
 A peer review platform for the Association for Computational Linguistics  

 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 ACL Rolling Review (ARR) invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The purpose of ARR is to improve the efficiency, turnaround, and process consistency of ACL reviewing, while keeping the diversity (topical, geographic and otherwise) and iterative improvement through collaborative work with conference program chairs. ARR will use Open Review as its platform (but reviews will not be open in ARR). The reviewing and acceptance of papers for publication will be done in two steps:  
 Step 1 – Centralized Rolling Review: Authors submit papers to a unified review pool with deadlines every two months. Review is handled by an area chair (AC), and revision and resubmission of papers are allowed. 
  Step 2 – Commitment to a Publication Venue: A publication venue is a conference or workshop that accepts reviews from ARR. When an opportunity to commit to a publication venue comes around, authors may submit papers with fully completed reviews (including meta reviews). Program chairs decide the process for committing ARR reviewed papers, as well as the criteria and process for deciding to accept a subset of these submissions into their event. 
  SCOPE OF SUBMISSIONS  
 All topics in Computational Linguistics / Natural Language Processing are welcome at ARR. At submission, papers must select a topic area to assist with AC and reviewer matching. The current set of areas are (in alphabetical order):  
 Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics 
  Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
  Discourse and Pragmatics 
  Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP 
  Ethics, Bias, and Fairness 
  Generation 
  Human-centered NLP 
  Information Extraction 
  Information Retrieval and Text Mining 
  Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP 
  Language Modeling 
  Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics 
  Machine Learning for NLP 
  Machine Translation 
  Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP 
  Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond 
  NLP Applications 
  Phonology, Morphology, and Word Segmentation 
  Question Answering 
  Resources and Evaluation 
  Semantics: Lexical and Sentence-Level 
  Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining 
  Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech and Spoken Language Understanding 
  Summarization 
  Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing 
  Theme tracks (proposed by participating publication venues and specific to those venues) 
  For more information about how to choose the right area, see this page  .  
 ARR welcomes diverse types of contributions in the above areas. When making a submission at ARR, the authors can indicate one or more of the following contribution types that their submission is making:  
 Approaches to low-resource settings 
  Approaches low compute settings-efficiency 
  Data resources 
  Data analysis 
  Model analysis & interpretability 
  NLP engineering experiment 
  Publicly available software and/or pre-trained models 
  Position papers 
  Reproduction study 
  Surveys (all papers are expected to include reviews of related literature. This category is meant for the papers that go beyond that, e.g. in scope or in establishing new interdisciplinary connections) 
  Theory 
  Both positive and negative results for experimental studies are welcome, and have the same challenge of justifying to the program committee why this particular result is interesting and important. A negative results paper might report on non-reproducibility or non-generalizability of previously published results, their misattribution (‘right for the wrong reasons’), or present an idea that seemed great (for well-justified reasons), but didn’t work.  
 ARR welcomes scholars from other communities who make a substantive contribution to the computational processing of language. Here are some points to keep in mind for a successful submission:  
 Interdisciplinary submissions typically aim to introduce concepts/methods/theories from one community to the CL/NLP community. 
  For machine learning application papers on areas other than language, if the authors feel that their work fits the NLP applications track (e.g. because it finds a new application for a language model), they are welcome to try to convince the reviewers and area chairs that their work should be presented in this venue. 
  A good rule-of-thumb to consider whether your work is connected to a given community is to consider whether your list of references has a substantial proportion of papers from that community. 
  PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION  
 Long Papers  
 Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Long papers may consist of:  
 up to eight (8) pages of content 
  unlimited extra space after the conclusion for limitations (required, see below) and optionally ethical considerations 
  plus unlimited pages of references 
  Submissions that exceed the length requirements, or are missing a limitations section, will be desk rejected.  
 Short Papers  
 Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a small, focused contribution that can be made in a few pages. Some common kinds of short papers are (non-)reproduction reports, negative results, opinion pieces, interesting application nuggets (but all these types of contributions could also be presented in long papers, given sufficient substance).  
 Short papers may consist of:  
 up to four (4) pages of content 
  unlimited extra space after the conclusion for limitations (required, see below) and optionally ethical considerations 
  plus unlimited pages of references 
  Submissions that exceed the length requirements, or are missing a limitations section, will be desk rejected.  
 Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review  
 Papers must not include authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the authors’ identities, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991)…” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)…” Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers.  
 Supplementary materials, including any links to repositories, should also be anonymized. This includes author responses during the review process. Links to file hosting services that can track downloads, such as Dropbox, are not allowed.  
 Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.  
 ARR is subject to the ACL Policies for Review and Citation  , which were updated in early 2024. Beginning with the February 15, 2024 ARR deadlines, there is no anonymity period or limitation on posting or discussing non-anonymous preprints while the work is under peer review. However, the new policy  incentivizes anonymous submissions by special paper awards and priority in acceptance decisions for borderline papers.  
 Authorship  
 The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to ARR will be notified of submissions and reviews. Please refer to the new ACL policy publication ethics  for authorship criteria.  
 Please notice that once the paper has been submitted, no changes to the list of authors are allowed. There are additional authorship rules for resubmissions (see below).  
 Citation and Comparison  
 Authors are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to their submission but may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited).  
 In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited in addition to or instead of the preprint version.  
 Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to a submission, and authors are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.  
 For more information, see the ACL Policies for Review and Citation  .  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 There are several cases to consider:  
 ARR + Other Venue | : ARR precludes multiple submissions. ARR will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the ARR review period. This policy covers all journals and refereed and archival conferences and workshops without exception (e.g., TACL, Computational Linguistics, IJCAI, SIGIR, AAAI, ICASSP, ICML, NeurIPS, etc). In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, without exception. 
  ARR + Commitment | : The commitment process is treated as being under review for a conference. That means (a) while in an active review cycle at ARR, a paper cannot be committed to a conference, and (b) between commitment to a conference and a decision or withdrawal, a paper cannot be submitted to ARR. For example, if you got reviews in the June 2023 cycle, you cannot both commit to EMNLP (August 22nd deadline) and submit a revised version to the August 2023 ARR cycle. Note that this is a change of policy relative to the early days of ARR, when this type of dual submission was permitted for ACL and NAACL 2022. 
  Commitment + Commitment/Other Venue | : Whether you can commit/submit to two venues simultaneously depends on the dual submission policies of those venues. Typically, it is not permitted. 
  ARR + ARR | : For the sake of clarity, this policy also covers ARR itself; authors may not resubmit to ARR work that is already under review to ARR. As of 2023, ARR does not have overlapping cycles, and so this is a moot point. 
  Submissions that violate requirements 1, 2, or 4 will be desk rejected.  
 Resubmission Policy  
 Authors may resubmit to ACL Rolling Review.  
 When resubmitting, the | authors must provide a link to the previous submission | . Any paper previously submitted that does not acknowledge its earlier version will be desk rejected. To count as a new paper rather than a revision, the submission must be on a sufficiently different topic that the prior reviews no longer apply (e.g., further improving the proposed methods or extending the set of experiments or analysis does not qualify, nor does extending a short paper to a long one). Please note that resubmission does | not | mean that papers are stuck with old reviewers: revised papers can still be sent to new reviewers and meta-reviewers on authors’ request (see below), with the authors indicating why they prefer that option. 
  To reduce the workload for the ACs and reviewers, and to focus the new reviews on the changes, the | authors must provide a summary of changes and revisions | in response to reviews from the previous round. For the latter, there should be an overview of changes and a point-by-point response to each weakness and suggestion from all reviewers (including meta-review where relevant), either describing the revision or arguing against it. It is recommended to refer to the location of revisions using section and line numbers. Some authors find it useful to color-code the changed parts in the text of the submission; this is allowed, but not mandated. A color-coded version of the paper may be included with the explanation of revisions in the same PDF. 
  Resubmissions must be modified versions of the original submission that address issues raised by the reviewers and meta-review; the authors may not simply resubmit the exact same paper, nor may they submit a completely new paper as if it were a resubmission. Resubmissions that ignore relevant feedback provided during the previous review round can be desk rejected by the EiC team. 
  If the authors want to add an author as part of a resubmission, they may do so with a (brief) justification; except in extremely rare circumstances, authors may not be removed. 
  Resubmitted papers will go back to the original reviewers and area chair, where possible, unless the authors request new reviewers or AC (with justification, e.g. violations of reviewer guidelines). Note that new reviewers are instructed to form their own view of the paper first: they only see the previous reviews and author explanation of revisions after they submit their initial reviews. See the information for authors ( | https://aclrollingreview.org/authors#step4 | ) for further discussion. 
  Submissions that had previously received very low evaluation from reviewers and a meta-review score of 1 generally need a wholesale revision that can be expected to take a lot of time. We reserve the right to desk reject such resubmissions if they are sent back to ARR within 6 months of the original submission without such a revision.  
 Authors considering a resubmission should also refer to the withdrawal policy  below.  
 Withdrawal Policy  
 Authors may withdraw their submission at any time. However, a submission that is withdrawn more than 48 hours after the submission deadline may not be resubmitted until the second subsequent ARR cycle, so withdrawing after this time requires contacting the ACs.  
 Once the submission receives the ARR meta-review, it is no longer considered under review, and can be submitted or committed elsewhere with no restrictions. There is no need to withdraw a meta-reviewed paper to resubmit to ARR or commit to a conference that accepts ARR reviews. When resubmitting a revised version, please follow the resubmission policy above.  
 Once a paper receives even one review at ARR, it cannot be simply withdrawn and submitted as a new publication.  If you intend to resubmit to ARR, do not  withdraw the previous version. Simply resubmit following the above resubmission policy.  
 Ethics Policy  
 Authors are required to honour the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics  .  
 The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Authors are encouraged to devote a section of their paper to concerns about the ethical impact of the work and to a discussion of broader impacts of the work, which will be taken into account in the review process. This discussion does not count towards the page limit, as long as it is placed in the end of the paper. In addition, we provide a responsible NLP research checklist  , which authors must complete as part of their paper submission. The content of checklists is used in the review process, and incorrect or misleading information in the checklist can result in desk rejection. Furthermore, ACL’25 will resume the publication of responsible NLP checklists for accepted papers for improving the overall transparency of the scientific process.  
 We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work. Indeed, the ARR review form includes a section addressing these issues and papers flagged for ethical concerns by reviewers or ACs will be further reviewed by the Ethics Advisory Committee (EAC).  
 AI Writing/Coding Assistance Policy  
 Generally, generative AI tools do not qualify for authorship. Their use for writing or coding, as well as its scope, must be disclosed in the Acknowledgements section, as well as flagged in the Responsible NLP Checklist. For coding, details may also be included in the README files.  
 ARR follows the new ACL Policy on AI Writing Assistance  , which recognizes the following cases are recognized as appropriate use of such tools:  
 a. | Assistance purely with the language of the paper. | This covers models used for paraphrasing or polishing the author’s original content, rather than for suggesting new content—similar to tools like grammar checkers, spell checkers, dictionaries, and synonym tools. The use of tools that only assist with proofreading, like grammar or spell checkers, does not need to be disclosed. 
  b. | Short-form input assistance. | This covers predictive keyboards or tools that offer suggestions during typing, that might be powered by generative language models. The use of such tools does not need to be disclosed. 
  c. | Literature search. | This covers search assistants, e.g., to identify relevant literature. The usual requirements for citation accuracy and thoroughness of literature reviews apply. 
  d. | Low-novelty text. | This covers the automatic generation of text about pre-existing ideas. Authors should specify where such automatically generated text was used, and convince the reviewers that the generation was checked to be accurate and is accompanied by relevant and appropriate citations. If the generation copies text from existing work, the publication ethics policy applies to that text. Authors need (for example) to acknowledge all relevant citations: both the source of the text used and the source of the idea(s). 
  e. | New ideas. | This covers when generative model output reads to the authors as new research ideas that would deserve co-authorship or acknowledgment from a human colleague (e.g., topics to discuss, framing of the problem), which the authors then develop themselves. As with all new ideas, the authors should conduct a literature search to determine relevant prior work and cite to ensure proper credit. The authors should disclose if models were used in this manner. 
  f. | New ideas + new text. | ACL does not consider a generative model to be an entity that can fulfill the requirements of co-authorship. 
  In all cases, all  authors are fully responsible for the correctness of their methods, results, and writing. They should check for potential plagiarism, both of text and code.  
 Limitations (required section)  
 Authors are required to discuss the limitations of their work in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section should be included at the end of the paper, before the references, and it will not count toward the page limit. This includes both, long and short papers. Papers without a limitations section will be desk rejected. Note, prior to the December 2023 cycle, this was optional.  
 Please note that this section should not introduce new methods, analysis, or results. We reserve the right to desk reject the submissions that use this section to introduce more content that should have been part of the main paper. It can only discuss the limitations of the work presented in the main content of the paper.  
 Reviewing Requirements  
 Submitting to ARR comes with a reviewing requirement. A t least one author must participate in the review process  , unless an exception applies (e.g., every author is either new to the community, has insufficient experience, or is already serving in another capacity). Papers that do not meet this requirement, and are not covered by an exception, may be desk rejected. There are of course legitimate reasons for one to suddenly be unavailable to review, and we will respect these (e.g. already serving in ARR in another capacity).  
 Authors who will review are nominated at submission time. They must:  
 Have an updated OpenReview profile, including affiliation, semantic scholar link, dblp link, ACL anthology link, and an email address where they can receive OpenReview messages. See | here | for how to maximize the likelihood of well-matched review assignments. 
  Have published at least three papers in the main computational linguistics and NLP venues in the last 5 years. (we consider publication history recorded at ACL anthology, which covers AACL/IJCNLP, ACL, CL, COLING, CONLL, EACL, EMNLP, NAACL, LREC, and TACL). Both short and long papers count, as do Findings papers.) 
  Once added as a reviewer, the new reviewers must complete their reviewer registration form for the cycle and set their availability to at least 4 papers within 48 hours. 
  The nominated authors who already have ARR reviewer profiles must also set their load for the current cycle to at least 4 papers per submission, prior to submission. In case of the same research group submitting multiple papers, it is the authors’ responsibility to coordinate within the group and ensure that either different senior authors are nominated, or the senior author undertakes a proportionately higher review load and will | mentor junior subreviewers | . 
  All reviewers must familiarize themselves with the latest version of the | ARR reviewer guidelines | and perform the reviews on time and in line with ARR requirements. 
  The number of papers assigned to each reviewer in a given cycle depends in part on the paper matching process. To mitigate the issue of overwhelming volume of assignments, ARR has implemented a load balance check across cycles. Please note that even with four assigned papers, contributing four reviews doesn’t fully reciprocate the volunteer effort that the authors receive for their submission to complete a full review cycle (it involves not just three reviews and a meta-review from the AC, potentially with emergency substitutions, but also effort from the SACs and PCs during paper commitment).  
 See this blog post  for further information about this requirement (as of April 2024).  
 Paper Submission Process, Criteria and Templates  
 Submission is electronic, using the OpenReview.net platform. All long, short, and theme papers must follow the ACL Author Guidelines  . Here  are the paper submission form fields for your reference.  
 ARR provides a submission checklist  . The checklist is intended as a reminder to help authors improve the quality of their papers, and decrease the risk of a desk rejection.  
 Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available here  (Latex and Word). Please follow the paper formatting guidelines general to “*ACL” conferences available here  . Authors may not modify these style files or use templates designed for other conferences.  
 Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.  
 Here  is the current version of the review form, and here  is the current version of the AC meta-review form. These forms will be re-assessed and updated periodically.  
 Desk Rejection  
 Papers can be desk-rejected for a variety of reasons, including format and anonymity violations, dual submissions, and self-plagiarism (significant overlap in content with other submissions or publications by the same authors). We provide authors with a checklist  to assist with avoiding some of the common issues (the list is not exhaustive).  
 Starting from December 2024, ARR will also enforce desk rejections for incorrect or misleading filing of the responsible NLP checklist, and for violating the resubmissions policy (i.e. submissions that are not accompanied with either revisions in response to prior reviews, or justifications for not doing so, as described in the section on resubmissions).  
 Note that while we do our best for the bulk of desk rejections to happen before the start of the review process, sometimes serious problems are missed at initial checks and discovered late. Hence, desk-rejections can happen at any time in the review cycle.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software, and Data  
 ARR encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. Supplementary materials may include appendices, software, or data. For example, pre-processing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into appendices.  
 However, reviewers are not required to consider material in appendices. If the pseudo-code, or derivations, or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper rather than appendices.  
 Appendices should come after the references in the submitted pdf. They do not count towards the page limit. Software should be submitted as a single .tgz or .zip archive, and data as a separate single .tgz or .zip archive. Supplementary materials must be fully anonymized to preserve the two-way anonymized reviewing policy.  
 If supplementary software is provided through a link to an online repository, it should be properly anonymized (e.g., Anonymous GitHub  ). Links to cloud services like Google Drive, Dropbox etc. are not acceptable, as they might track the download activity.

 Call for Special Sessions, Tutorials and Workshops  
 The ACIIDS 2025 invites proposals for Special Sessions, Workshops, and Tutorials to be held during the conference.  
 They intend to provide researchers in focused areas the opportunity to present and discuss their work and offer a forum for interaction among a broader community of researchers. A Session or Workshop will consist of a group of papers in a sub-discipline of Intelligent Information and Database Systems related to the main topics of ACIIDS 2025, while Tutorials mainly focus on presenting new trends and research opportunities in the fields of databases and intelligent systems.  
 Please send the proposals to Dr Bogumiła Hnatkowska (bogumila.hnatkowska@pwr.edu.pl) with the following information:  
 Title & acronym of the session, workshop, or tutorial 
  Brief profiles of organizers 
  General description of the session, workshop, or tutorial scope 
  List of topics 
  Proposed Board of Reviewers (to be invited) 
   
 The papers will be required to meet the same standards as ACIIDS papers and will be published in the conference proceedings, in a bound volume by Springer-Verlag.  
 All the Special Sessions and Doctoral Track will be centralized as tracks in the same conference submission and reviewing system as the regular papers.  
 The organizers will be responsible for the advertisement and promotion of the special session and the conference including the Special Session webpage preparation.  
 The review process for the conference is highly rigorous. It comprises two phases: we gather reviews from reviewers, and in the second phase submissions and reviews are re-evaluated by the Meta-reviewing Committee. Although the Organizers of Special Sessions are responsible for the review process, the final decision regarding acceptance will be made by the ACIIDS Program Committee.  
 These rules aim to select the best papers and ensure the highest quality of the chosen papers. Our review model ensures that papers from both the Main Track and Special Sessions are held to an equally high standard.

 Proposal Deadline:  June 9, 2024    
   Notification by:  June 30, 2024   
 Email  : accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com    
 We are soliciting proposals for in-person workshops to be held together with the 17th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2024 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Workshops — co-located with ACML 2024 – will take place on the 8th and 9th of December, 2024.   
 The purpose of workshops is to provide a comprehensive forum on emerging topics that will not be fully explored in the main conference and to encourage in-­depth discussion of various technical and application, and community issues in computer vision. We also welcome “Challenge Workshops” that aim to compare new and established methods on common data sets. Workshop registration, venue, as well as proceedings will be handled as part of the main conference by the ACCV organizers.   
 The selection process for workshop space, time and topic coverage will be competitive. We will consider topic coverage, the proposers’ credentials, the interested audience, and relevance of the topic in the selection process. Please note that proposers may be asked to provide additional information, modify aspects of their proposals, or merge their proposal with other ones.   
 Proposals should be submitted in PDF format (max 4 pages without references, single-column, not less than 10.5 font size) by email to the workshop chairs (  accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com   ) by  May 31, 2024 (23:59 AoE time)   . The candidate workshop organizers will be notified of the decision by June 30, 2024.  When preparing a proposal, please note that ACCV regular paper acceptance notification is on September 20, 2024.    
 The proposals should include the following information:   
 1. TECHNICAL INFORMATION   
 Workshop title 
  Topics that will be covered, with descriptions of why they are relevant. 
  Description of how this proposal relates to the workshops at previous ACCV and CVPR/ICCV/ECCV etc. (be as specific as possible). 
   
 2. ORGANIZERS AND SPEAKERS   
 Organizers’ names, titles and affiliations, with one, potentially two, contact emails of reliably responsive organizers. 
  Background and experience that makes the proposers well-suited for organizing the workshop, including brief biographies. 
  In case this event is part of a workshop series, please provide URLs to the web pages of relevant past events and/or any other relevant information. 
  List of invited speakers. Please list only speakers that confirmed or tentatively confirmed their attendance. For each speaker, please indicate if confirmation is tentative or final. 
  3. LOGISTICS   
 Preference for half-day or full-day event (Note that your workshop may be accepted as a half-day event due to space limitation regardless of your request in proposal.) 
  Tentative program committee. 
  Please indicate one of the following options describing the nature of your event: | Workshop is primarily an invited speaker event 
  Workshop is primarily a peer-reviewed paper event (orals/posters) 
  Workshop will have a roughly even split between invited speakers and peer-reviewed papers 
  Please also indicate if you plan to run a competition with your workshop. 
  If relevant, please provide a paper review timeline. 
  If the workshop includes peer-reviewed papers, will these papers be published in proceedings? (If the answer is yes, you may need to follow the publication schedule of the main conference.) 
  If posters are considered, how many are expected? Note that the conference may limit the number of posters based on available space. 
  Special space or equipment requests, if any. 
  4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   
 After acceptance, workshops will be required to prepare their own websites, separate from the ACCV 2024 webpage. These pages will include workshop details, organizers, dates, submission instructions and, once finalized, the workshop program. 
  Accepted workshops must provide their program material using a conference Google sheet for producing program/app information. 
  Since ACML 2024 and ACCV 2024 are co-located, please confirm whether you’d be okay if this workshop is shared between the two conferences (Note that workshop chairs will make the final decision on this, based on the overall conference logistics). 
  Additional Contact Information:  
 Note that all workshops are to be in-person. For any questions, please contact the workshop chairs via email at:  accv24-workshop-chairs@googlegroups.com   .

 Joint Call for Tutorial Proposals  
 The North American Chapter of the ACL - Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT), the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), and the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) invite proposals for tutorials in conjunction with NAACL-HLT 2025  , ACL 2025  , and EMNLP 2025 conferences  . We seek proposals in all areas of computational linguistics (CL) / natural language processing (NLP), broadly conceived to include related disciplines. We invite proposals for two types of tutorials:  
 Cutting-edge in CL / NLP | : Tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any EACL/NAACL-HLT/ACL/EMNLP related tutorial (see the list of tutorials in the past 9 years), or 
  Introductory to fields related to CL / NLP | : Tutorials that provide introductions to related fields that are potentially relevant for the CL / NLP community (e.g., linguistics, bioinformatics, machine learning techniques, human-computer interaction, large language models for non-English languages, etc.). 
  In both cases, the aim of a tutorial is primarily to help CL/NLP researchers to understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations.  
 Tutorials will be held at one of the following conference venues:  
 NAACL-HLT 2025: Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA on April 29 - May 4, 2025 
  ACL 2025: Vienna, Austria on July 27 - August 1, 2025 
  EMNLP 2025: Location TBD, late in 2025 
  Important Dates  
 NAACL-HLT/ACL/EMNLP 2025 shared dates:  
  
 Proposal submission deadline | October 22, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance | November 22, 2024 
  
 All deadlines are 11:59 PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).  
 Fee Waivers  
 Up to 3 instructors per tutorial  can have their registration fees waived for the main conference and any subset of co-located tutorials and workshops.  
 Diversity & Inclusion  
 To foster an inclusive culture in our field, we particularly encourage submissions from members of underrepresented groups in CL/NLP, i.e., researchers from any demographic or geographic minority, researchers with disabilities, among others. The overall diversity of the tutorial organizers and potential audience will be taken into account to ensure that the conference program is varied and balanced.  
 Tutorial proposals should describe and will be evaluated according to how the tutorial contributes to topics promoting diversity  (e.g., working on minority languages or groups), participation diversity  (e.g., coordinating with social affinity groups, providing subsidies, making a promotional plan for the tutorial), and representation diversity  among tutorial presenters. For more information or advice, organizers may consult resources such as the BIG directory  , Black in AI  , Disability in AI  , Indigenous AI  , LatinX in AI  , Masakhane  , 500 Queer Scientists  , and Women-in-ML’s directory  .  
 Submission Details  
 Proposals should use the ACL paper submission format. Authors can download  the LaTeX or Word template or use the Overleaf template  . Proposals should not exceed 4 pages of content  (plus one page for tutor biographies and unlimited pages for references), should be submitted as PDF documents, and should contain the following:  
 A title and authors, affiliations, and contact information. 
  A brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the CL / NLP community. 
  Type of the tutorial: “cutting-edge in CL / NLP” vs ”introductory to fields related to CL/NLP”. 
  Briefly describe the target audience and any expected prerequisites for the attendees, for example: | Math: e.g., “Understand derivatives and integrals as found in introductory calculus” 
  Linguistics: e.g., “Be able to parse and generate text with dependency grammars” 
  Machine Learning: e.g., “Understand ‘classical’ supervised methods such as SVM and perceptron” 
  Neural Network: e.g., “Familiarity with transformers” 
  Programming or other tools: e.g., “Knowledge of Pytorch and Unix command line tools” 
  An outline of the tutorial structure and content and how it will be covered in a three-hour slot. In exceptional cases, six-hour tutorial slots are available. These time limits do not include coffee breaks, e.g., a three-hour tutorial in fact occupies a 3.5-hour slot, and a six-hour tutorial occupies a 7-hour slot. 
  Explain how the tutorial includes other people’s work. We recommend that the tutorial covers work by the presenters as well as by other researchers. The submission should explain how this breadth is ensured. Tutorials should not be “self-invited talks”. 
  Diversity considerations, e.g., use of multilingual data, indications of how the described methods scale up to various languages or domains, participation of both senior and junior instructors, demographic and geographical diversity of the instructors, plans for how to diversify audience participation, etc. 
  Reading list. Work that you expect the audience to read before the tutorial can be indicated by an asterisk. Recommended papers should provide breadth of authorship and include work by other authors as well as work from other disciplines is welcomed if relevant. 
  For each tutorial presenter, a one-paragraph statement of their research interests and areas of expertise for the tutorial topic, as well as experience in instructing an international audience. 
  An estimate of the audience size for the tutorial. If the same or a similar tutorial (or workshops, talks, etc.) has been given before, include information on where any previous version of the tutorial was given and how many attendees the tutorial attracted. 
  A note specifying which venue(s) (NAACL-HLT/ACL/EMNLP) would be acceptable and/or preferable. Include a description of any constraints that might make the tutorial compatible with only one of these events, logistically, thematically, or otherwise. 
  A description of special requirements for technical equipment. 
  We intend to make tutorial presentation materials publicly available (e.g., tutorial slides, captioned video recording, as well as software, data, or other resources as applicable) in the ACL Anthology. If any of your tutorial materials cannot be shared, please explain why this is the case. 
  An ethics statement that discusses the ethical considerations related to the topics of the tutorial. 
  OPTIONAL | : We welcome proposals on special conference themes. If your tutorial proposal aligns with the special theme of a conference, then please explain why this is the case. 
  OPTIONAL | : We invite tutorial instructors to include pedagogical material that the audience can bring into classrooms or similar spaces of discussion, to bring attention to the tutorial topic (e.g., a hands-on exercise, discussion questions, a demo, or an assignment). If you would like to provide this, then please explain why this is the case. 
  Tutorial proposals should be submitted online using the softconf system at the following link: https://softconf.com/p/acl-tutorials2025  . Proposals will be reviewed jointly by the Tutorial Co-Chairs of the conferences and optionally by a group of external experts.  
 Evaluation Criteria  
 Each tutorial proposal will be evaluated according to its clarity and preparedness, novelty or timely character of the topic, instructors’ experience, target audience, open access of the tutorial instructional material, and diversity and inclusion.  
 Instructor Responsibilities  
 Tutorial decisions along with reviews will be released by Nov 22, 2024  . Accepted tutorial proposers must then provide abstracts for inclusion in the conference registration material by the specific conference deadlines. The description should be in two formats: (a) an ASCII version that can be included in email announcements and published on the conference website, and (b) a PDF version for inclusion in the electronic proceedings (detailed instructions will be provided). Tutorial speakers must provide tutorial materials (e.g., slides, relevant list of papers) at least one month prior to the start date of the hosting conference  . The final submitted tutorial materials must minimally include copies of the course slides and a bibliography for the material covered in the tutorial. After the conference, the presenters will be invited to update their slides in the ACL Anthology (if needed).

 Overview  
 ACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 February cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 February cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to ACL 2025 via the conference commitment site (TBA).  
 Submission Topics  
 ACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):

 Following the success of the ACL 2020-2024 Theme tracks, we are happy to announce that ACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP.  
 Generalization is crucial for ensuring that models behave robustly, reliably, and fairly when making predictions on data different from their training data. Achieving good generalization is critically important for models used in real-world applications, as they should emulate human-like behavior. Humans are known for their ability to generalize well, and models should aspire to this standard.  
 The theme track invites empirical and theoretical research and position and survey papers reflecting on the Generalization of NLP Models. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:  
 How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness? 
  What factors affect the generalization of NLP models? 
  What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models? 
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard? 
  The theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session for this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards.  
 Two-Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to ACL 2025  
 ACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review  (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review  platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., ACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
  ACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with *CL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload  
 As the pace of research in the field continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here. As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.  
 Important Dates  
 Submission deadline (all papers are submitted to ARR) | : February 15, 2025

  Note: All deadlines are at 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).   
 Paper Submission Details  
 Both long and short paper submissions should follow all of the ARR submission requirements  , including:  
 Long Papers | (8 pages) and | Short Papers | (4 pages) 
  Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review 
  Authorship 
  Citation and Comparison 
  Multiple Submission Policy | , | Resubmission Policy | , and | Withdrawal Policy 
  Ethics Policy | including the | responsible NLP research checklist 
  Limitations 
  Paper Submission and Templates 
  Optional Supplementary Materials | Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments. 
  Following the ACL and ARR policies  , there is no anonymity period requirement.   
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected ACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to ACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than ACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to ACL 2025.  
 Presentation at the Conference  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection. Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.

 Overview  
 ACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 February cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 February cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to ACL 2025 via the conference commitment site (TBA).

 Overview  
 ACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 February cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 February cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to ACL 2025 via the conference commitment site (TBA).  
 Submission Topics  
 ACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):

  Special Theme | : Generalization of NLP Models 
  ACL 2025 Theme Track: Generalization of NLP Models  
 Following the success of the ACL 2020-2024 Theme tracks, we are happy to announce that ACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP.  
 Generalization is crucial for ensuring that models behave robustly, reliably, and fairly when making predictions on data different from their training data. Achieving good generalization is critically important for models used in real-world applications, as they should emulate human-like behavior. Humans are known for their ability to generalize well, and models should aspire to this standard.  
 The theme track invites empirical and theoretical research and position and survey papers reflecting on the Generalization of NLP Models. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:  
 How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness? 
  What factors affect the generalization of NLP models? 
  What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models? 
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard? 
  The theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session for this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards.  
 Two-Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to ACL 2025  
 ACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review  (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review  platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., ACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
  ACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with *CL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload  
 As the pace of research in the field continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here. As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.

  Following the ACL and ARR policies  , there is no anonymity period requirement.   
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected ACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to ACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than ACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to ACL 2025.  
 Presentation at the Conference  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection. Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.

  Submission Guidelines  
 All papers for ACM WiSec 2025 must be submitted electronically through the HotCRP conference management system  .  
 Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions must be prepared using the following ACM proceedings template and must use US Letter page size (215.9 x 279.4 mm / 8.5 x 11 inches):  
 The ACM proceedings template for LaTeX can be found at | Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - SIG Proceedings Template | . 
  Please look at | ACM Primary Article Template | for further information on ACM proceedings templates. 
  Full, short, and SoK papers  
 Full paper submissions to ACM WiSec 2025 can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind reviewing.  
 Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches.  
 In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Posters and demos  
 WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Artifact Evaluation label  
 In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.  
 Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Double submissions  
 It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed.  
 Workshops and Tutorial  
 ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.  
 Research Ethics  
 Ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices were not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no “one size fits all” approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication.  
 While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm.  
 Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as “human subjects.” For WiSec, “human subject research” is defined as “research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans.” Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met.  
 Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advances tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties  
 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity  
 All SIGSAC sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities ( https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment  ) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ( https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)  . Also all authors, PC members and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc)  . Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations)  . If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.

They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Posters and demos  
 WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Artifact Evaluation label  
 In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.  
 Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Double submissions  
 It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed.  
 Workshops and Tutorial  
 ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.  
 Research Ethics  
 Ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices were not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no “one size fits all” approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication.  
 While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm.  
 Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as “human subjects.” For WiSec, “human subject research” is defined as “research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans.” Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met.  
 Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advances tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties  
 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity  
 All SIGSAC sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities ( https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment  ) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ( https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)  . Also all authors, PC members and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc)  . Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations)  . If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.

 The 16th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2024) will take place between December 5th - 8th, 2024 in Hanoi, Vietnam. The conference aims to provide a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share their new ideas, progress and achievements.  
  The conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals focusing on frontier research, new ideas and paradigms in machine learning. We encourage submissions from all parts of the world, not only confined to the Asia-Pacific region.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Similar to previous years, ACML 2024 has two publication tracks. Each paper may be submitted to either:  
 Conference Track  
 Conference Track: (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).  
  Submission Deadline: 03 July 2024   
  For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via OpenReview at:  
  https://openreview.net/group?id=ACML.org/2024/Conference   
  Manuscripts must be written in English, and should follow the Latex submission template and style file here ACML2024_submission_template.zip  with a 16-page limit, including references and appendix. Supplementary materials may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider it.  
  All conference track submissions must be anonymized for double-blinded review. Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing.  
  It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals (including our journal track). However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission.  
 Journal Track  
 Submission Deadline: May 29, 2024   
  In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published.   
  IMPORTANT  : Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously  for the purpose of review management:  
 1) First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via OpenReview at ACML 2024 Journal Track | OpenReview  : (paper manuscript need not be submitted here).  
  2) Then, please submit the full paper via Springer Nature’s manuscript submission system at: Select article type : Machine Learning (springernature.com)  . When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose “Special Issue for ACML 2024” as the article type.  
 Failure to submit to both systems will result in desk-reject of the paper.  
 For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  .  
 The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal.  
 The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).  
 Important Dates  
 Kindly note that all deadlines would be at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) unless otherwise specified.

  Submission Instructions  
 Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to:  
 Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR). 
  Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ). 
  Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.    
 Conference Track  
 Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  .  
 IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the "Conference"  track.  
 The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  .  
  The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  .  
 Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this.  
 All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing.  
 It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission.  
 Journal Track  
 Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published.  
 IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management:  
 First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | "Journal" | track. 
  Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | "S.I.: ACML 2023" | as the article type. 
  For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  .  
 The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal.  
 The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).

  Submission Instructions  
  
  Similar to previous years, ACML 2022 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to the:  
   
  Conference track | (16-page limit with references), for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR). 
  Journal track | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal(MLJ). 
  Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.    
   
  Conference Track  
  
  Submission Deadline: June 23, 2022   
   
  For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2022  . CMT will open one month before the deadline, i.e. on 23 May, 2022, for the conference track.  
   
  IMPORTANT:  When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose 'Conference' track.  
   
  The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2022-camera_ready-template.zip.   
   
  Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this.  
   
  All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. (Updated on Jun 20, 2022: To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing).  It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g. in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission.  
   
  After the acceptance notification, we plan to invite some of the selected authors to submit their extended papers to the Topical Issue in Springer Nature Computer Science  .  
   
  Journal Track  
  
  Submission Deadline: May 26, 2022   
   
  In addition to the Conference Track, this year’s ACML will run a Journal Track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published.  
   
  IMPORTANT:  Similar to previous years, for the Journal Track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously  for the purpose of review management:  
   
  First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2022. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the “Journal” track. 
  Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose 'S.I. : ACML 2022' as the article type. 
  For the Journal Track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices etc). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994   
   
  The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The Journal Track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal.  
   
  The Journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g. in arXiv).

 Our Research Association  

 Home   | About ForDaySec   | Our Research Association     
 Topic of the Research Association  
 The unique selling point of the Bavarian research association “Security in Everyday Digitization” (ForDaySec) is the targeted, interdisciplinary research into novel technical processes for the cyber security of private households, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and public administration. With this goal in mind, ForDaySec is researching, in addition to solutions for increasing security for hardware and software, special security concepts that should be easy to implement without special knowledge and at the same time take into account the aspects of technical data protection. The research also includes legal studies on update obligations and sociological studies on the use of technology in everyday practice.  
 Social Relevance  
 The digitization of everyday life is one of the key challenges facing our society. Networked systems permeate all areas of our society – this applies to private households (for example, the vacuum cleaner robot or the digital heating control system) as well as to production operations of medium-sized companies, craft enterprises, housing associations or to municipally operated critical infrastructures (such as healthcare or water supply). Something can be observed everywhere: Components without security functions are being used unthinkingly, previously independent systems are being networked without precautions, and both the knowledge and the human resources to actively manage cybersecurity are missing in many places.  
 Moreover, existing digital infrastructures often cannot be fundamentally redesigned or changed to secure them – security solutions must be designed using existing systems and components, and integrated into the existing stock. In the sense of “security by default”, there is also a need to make security and data protection technologies simple and easy to administer and implement without in-depth specialist knowledge. Here, however, the challenges are not only of a technical nature, but also encounter organizational, procedural and personnel hurdles. Interdisciplinary research that systematically integrates the challenges of everyday practice and everyday practices from the outset is therefore imperative. Our group takes this mixed situation into account and uses it as a starting point for its research.  
 Structure  
 In the research association ForDaySec, scientists from five Bavarian universities are working in eight projects to make everyday digital life more secure. The associatopn works interdisciplinarily and combines the perspectives of three disciplines: Computer Science, Sociology of Technology, and Law.  
 Each of the projects conducts research on its own topic in its own discipline. In addition, the members work in close cooperation on cross-cutting issues   .  
 The research association is represented publicly by co-speakers  elected by the members (Prof. Dr. Stefan Katzenbeisser and Prof. Dr. Felix Freiling). The management office  is located at the University of Passau at the professorship of Prof. Dr. Katzenbeisser. The office  is the central point of contact for members, external partners and those interested in our association.  
 ForDaySec is one of several Bavarian research alliances under the umbrella of the Bavarian Research Alliance  .  
 Interdisciplinarity  
 The eight projects at five universities involved in ForDaySec rely on a systematic interdisciplinary approach. The scientists  from the fields of computer science, business informatics, sociology and law are developing a comprehensive understanding of how technologies can be optimized and sustainably implemented to safeguard everyday digital life.  
 While specific individual questions are dealt with in the eight projects, interdisciplinary cooperation takes place in particular within the working groups on the cross-cutting issues  .

 Join us in Hawaii for our 40th anniversary!  
   
 The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)  brings together leading researchers and practitioners, along with a diverse group of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest cybersecurity results and topics. With peer reviewed technical papers, invited talks, panels, national interest discussions, and workshops, ACSAC continues its core mission of investigating practical solutions for computer and network security technologies.  
 This year, we will celebrate ACSAC's 40th edition. ACSAC's first edition was held in 1985 and is now one of the oldest computer security conferences, second only to the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. We invite you to join us for this special anniversary, which will be held near the infamous Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii!  
 As an internationally recognized forum where researchers, practitioners, and developers meet to learn and to exchange practical ideas and experiences in computer and network security, we invite you to submit your work. In addition to peer-reviewed papers on novel applied research, we also welcome case studies on real-world applications, panels featuring world experts, and workshops consisting of 1-2 day sessions on hot cybersecurity and privacy topics.

 Hard Topic Theme: Security Applications of Generative AI   
 This year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that advance our understanding of the applicability of Generative AI and Large Language Models to computer security. These transformative new technologies can have a significant impact in addressing traditional security problems, such as vulnerability detection, fraud detection, reverse engineering, threat intelligence, and many others. At the same time, the complexity of these systems also exposes new potential vulnerabilities that are still not well understood by the research community.

 ACSAC solicits papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security research. We encourage papers with results that are demonstrably useful for improving cybersecurity and that address lessons learned from practical applications. In particular, we encourage the submission of papers related to our hard topic theme: Security Applications of Generative AI  . Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published elsewhere or that have been simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with proceedings and are under review.  
   
 Make Submission   
 ** New this year **  Reproduction and Replication (R+R) Papers:  Security research is often criticized for the poor reproducibility of its results, a situation we aim to address through artifact evaluation. At the same time, reproduction and replication studies are often undervalued in academic publishing. Thus, in addition to regular papers and artifact evaluations, this year we are also soliciting studies that confirm, question, or clarify the results of previous research. These papers must contain the prefix “R+R:” in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.  
 We encourage submissions to follow the ACM guidelines on reproducibility  (different team, same experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-use) and replicability  (different team, different experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-implementation). Note, however, that submissions need to go beyond re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper(s) or re-implementing their approach. We are looking for submissions that not only replicate existing studies but also critically assess, clarify and extend their findings and limitations. This includes, but is not limited to, the verification of existing research results, ensuring their validity and reliability across different contexts, lessons learned when applying research results in real-world (industry) settings, and the adaption of artifacts to contemporary cybersecurity challenges.  
 Reproduction and replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as original technical papers, will be reviewed by the full program committee, will appear in the proceedings, and will be presented at the conference as part of the technical program. We also particularly encourage these types of papers to provide their artifacts.  
 Review Process:  Paper submissions will be judged based on novelty, relevance to the conference topics, technical correctness, quality of the evaluation, and presentation clarity. Papers will undergo a double-blind review process in two rounds. At the end of Round 1, papers for which a strong consensus towards rejection is reached will be notified of the early rejection decision, giving them the opportunity to improve their paper based on the reviewers’ feedback and to resubmit to other venues. Papers that advance to Round 2 will be assigned additional reviewers. At the end of Round 2, the authors of papers that advanced to this stage will have an opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and comments. After the authors' response period, the papers will be further discussed by the Program Committee (PC) to reach a final decision.  
 Three outcomes are possible: Accepted, Minor Revision, and Rejected. The Minor Revision decision is reserved to papers that can be considered as conditionally accepted, assuming improvements required by the reviewers are made within the available revision time window and are approved by the PC. A PC member will be assigned as shepherd for Minor Revision papers, to guide the authors through the revision process and to lead the discussion on the revised paper among the reviewers. The revision requirements may include both presentation improvements and additional experiments that the PC believes are necessary to significantly improve the paper and that should be feasible within a limited time frame. While Minor Revision papers that do not meet the required changes may be rejected, the expectation is that most papers will be able to satisfy the required improvements and be finally accepted into the conference program. Both the author's responses and the discussions around revision requirements for Minor Revision papers will be handled anonymously, via the paper submission system.  
 Paper Artifacts:  Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to submit their software and data artifacts for formal evaluation by the Artifacts Evaluation Committee  and to make them publicly available to the entire community. During submission, authors of papers whose main contributions and experimental results rely primarily on new or reproduced artifacts (e.g., code and/or data) should indicate whether they will separately submit their artifacts for evaluation, if their paper is accepted. This acknowledgement will be visible to the reviewers and may therefore be taken into consideration during the review process. Authors who have justifiable reasons to not submit their artifacts for evaluation (in case their paper is accepted) should add a comment in the corresponding comment box in the submission form. Additionally, during paper submission authors can optionally provide a URL pointing to a repository containing their paper artifacts. While artifacts will be formally evaluated only if the paper is accepted, as explained above, reviewers may also take into account the availability and quality of the paper artifacts during the main paper review process, before making a final decision (please refer to the paper submission form for additional details).  
 Important:  When preparing the artifacts repository for inclusion in the paper submission form, please take extra care to not include authors’ information in the repository or artifacts content, so as not to break the anonymity of the paper submission. Additional information and recommendations on anonymizing the artifacts repository can be found here  .  
 Ethical Considerations:  Papers that might raise ethical concerns (e.g., papers that use human subjects, leverage potentially sensitive data, or describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems) must include an Ethical Considerations section that properly describes what procedures have been followed to minimize potential harm. Such papers should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties, whether an institutional ethics committee reviewed the research, or how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software/system vendors or owners before publication.  
 Paper Format:  Please ensure that your submission consists of a PDF file of no more than 10 double-column pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to a maximum of 5 pages. The full PDF document must not exceed a total of 15 pages. Please note that PC members are not required to read the appendices and that page limits will be strictly enforced.  
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to the dual anonymous review process. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. In the rare case that citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs.  
 Submission Process:  Submissions must be generated using the double-column ACM format (see template available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  ) using the [sigconf, anonymous]  options. Submissions should not use older ACM templates (e.g., sig-alternate). All papers must be submitted exclusively through the ACSAC 2024 paper submission system. Note that paper title and abstract registration is not necessary ahead of the paper submission.  
 All formatting guidelines and constraints (e.g., page limits and anonymity) will be strictly enforced. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
 Topics:  The main topics of interest to ACSAC include, but are not limited to  
 Access Control, Assurance, Audit 
  Anonymity, Privacy 
  Application Security 
  Big Data for Security

 ACSAC solicits papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security research. We encourage papers with results that are demonstrably useful for improving cybersecurity and that address lessons learned from practical applications. In particular, we encourage the submission of papers related to our hard topic theme: Security Applications of Generative AI  . Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published elsewhere or that have been simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with proceedings and are under review.  
   
 Make Submission   
 ** New this year **  Reproduction and Replication (R+R) Papers:  Security research is often criticized for the poor reproducibility of its results, a situation we aim to address through artifact evaluation. At the same time, reproduction and replication studies are often undervalued in academic publishing. Thus, in addition to regular papers and artifact evaluations, this year we are also soliciting studies that confirm, question, or clarify the results of previous research. These papers must contain the prefix “R+R:” in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.  
 We encourage submissions to follow the ACM guidelines on reproducibility  (different team, same experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-use) and replicability  (different team, different experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-implementation). Note, however, that submissions need to go beyond re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper(s) or re-implementing their approach. We are looking for submissions that not only replicate existing studies but also critically assess, clarify and extend their findings and limitations. This includes, but is not limited to, the verification of existing research results, ensuring their validity and reliability across different contexts, lessons learned when applying research results in real-world (industry) settings, and the adaption of artifacts to contemporary cybersecurity challenges.  
 Reproduction and replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as original technical papers, will be reviewed by the full program committee, will appear in the proceedings, and will be presented at the conference as part of the technical program. We also particularly encourage these types of papers to provide their artifacts.  
 Review Process:  Paper submissions will be judged based on novelty, relevance to the conference topics, technical correctness, quality of the evaluation, and presentation clarity. Papers will undergo a double-blind review process in two rounds. At the end of Round 1, papers for which a strong consensus towards rejection is reached will be notified of the early rejection decision, giving them the opportunity to improve their paper based on the reviewers’ feedback and to resubmit to other venues. Papers that advance to Round 2 will be assigned additional reviewers. At the end of Round 2, the authors of papers that advanced to this stage will have an opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and comments. After the authors' response period, the papers will be further discussed by the Program Committee (PC) to reach a final decision.  
 Three outcomes are possible: Accepted, Minor Revision, and Rejected. The Minor Revision decision is reserved to papers that can be considered as conditionally accepted, assuming improvements required by the reviewers are made within the available revision time window and are approved by the PC. A PC member will be assigned as shepherd for Minor Revision papers, to guide the authors through the revision process and to lead the discussion on the revised paper among the reviewers. The revision requirements may include both presentation improvements and additional experiments that the PC believes are necessary to significantly improve the paper and that should be feasible within a limited time frame. While Minor Revision papers that do not meet the required changes may be rejected, the expectation is that most papers will be able to satisfy the required improvements and be finally accepted into the conference program. Both the author's responses and the discussions around revision requirements for Minor Revision papers will be handled anonymously, via the paper submission system.  
 Paper Artifacts:  Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to submit their software and data artifacts for formal evaluation by the Artifacts Evaluation Committee  and to make them publicly available to the entire community. During submission, authors of papers whose main contributions and experimental results rely primarily on new or reproduced artifacts (e.g., code and/or data) should indicate whether they will separately submit their artifacts for evaluation, if their paper is accepted. This acknowledgement will be visible to the reviewers and may therefore be taken into consideration during the review process. Authors who have justifiable reasons to not submit their artifacts for evaluation (in case their paper is accepted) should add a comment in the corresponding comment box in the submission form. Additionally, during paper submission authors can optionally provide a URL pointing to a repository containing their paper artifacts. While artifacts will be formally evaluated only if the paper is accepted, as explained above, reviewers may also take into account the availability and quality of the paper artifacts during the main paper review process, before making a final decision (please refer to the paper submission form for additional details).  
 Important:  When preparing the artifacts repository for inclusion in the paper submission form, please take extra care to not include authors’ information in the repository or artifacts content, so as not to break the anonymity of the paper submission. Additional information and recommendations on anonymizing the artifacts repository can be found here  .  
 Ethical Considerations:  Papers that might raise ethical concerns (e.g., papers that use human subjects, leverage potentially sensitive data, or describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems) must include an Ethical Considerations section that properly describes what procedures have been followed to minimize potential harm. Such papers should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties, whether an institutional ethics committee reviewed the research, or how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software/system vendors or owners before publication.  
 Paper Format:  Please ensure that your submission consists of a PDF file of no more than 10 double-column pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to a maximum of 5 pages. The full PDF document must not exceed a total of 15 pages. Please note that PC members are not required to read the appendices and that page limits will be strictly enforced.  
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to the dual anonymous review process. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. In the rare case that citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs.  
 Submission Process:  Submissions must be generated using the double-column ACM format (see template available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  ) using the [sigconf, anonymous]  options. Submissions should not use older ACM templates (e.g., sig-alternate). All papers must be submitted exclusively through the ACSAC 2024 paper submission system. Note that paper title and abstract registration is not necessary ahead of the paper submission.  
 All formatting guidelines and constraints (e.g., page limits and anonymity) will be strictly enforced. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

 Call for Submissions  
 ACSAC is an internationally recognized forum where practitioners, researchers, and developers in information system security meet to learn and to exchange practical ideas and experiences. If you are developing practical solutions to problems related to the protection of users, commercial enterprises, or countries' information infrastructures, consider submitting your work to the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference.  
 We solicit submissions that address the application of security technology, the implementation of systems, and the discussion of lessons learned. While we are interested in a variety of topics  , we especially encourage submissions in the area of our Hard Topic Theme  , Trustworthy Systems  .  
   
 Submission Types  
 Technical Papers   
 We solicit papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security. Papers are encouraged on results that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons learned from the actual application. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Please ensure that your submission is a PDF file of a maximum of 10 pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to 5 pages. Committee members are not required to read the appendices.  
 Case Studies   
 The Case Studies in Applied Security Track is a critical part of the technical conference. It is an opportunity for professionals to share information that is current without writing a detailed technical paper, but enables attendees to learn about the next generation of products and solutions. It is open to anyone in the community such as vendors, network providers, systems integrators, government civil/federal/military programs or users across the spectrum of computer security applications. Potentially this is where attendees can learn about client needs and vendors solutions. While the Case Studies will not be included in the Proceedings, a Best Case Study Award will be presented to one of the talks, and all Case Studies presentations will be posted to the ACSAC site following the conference.  
 Panels   
 Panels should encourage audience participation and focus on the sharp edges of a topic where there is controversy or where there are widely varying positions. Panels focused on a topic related to the conference theme are especially welcomed, but this is not a hard requirement; some additional topics are listed here  . A typical panel proposal should list the moderator, three panel members and an abstract of the proposed topic.  
 Posters   
 The poster session provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their new and innovative preliminary work in an informal, interactive setting. Conference attendees can learn about novel on-going research projects that might not yet be complete, but whose preliminary results are already interesting. Poster presenters will have an opportunity to discuss their work and get invaluable feedback from knowledgeable sources at an early stage of their research.  
 Works in Progress   
 The Works in Progress (WiP) session offers short presentations (5 minutes maximum) of ongoing work. These presentations highlight the most current work in both business and academia, emphasizing goals and value added, accomplishments to date, and future plans. Special consideration is given to topics that discuss real life security experience, including system implementation, deployment, and lessons learned.  
 Workshops   
 ACSAC workshops are on up to date topics that attendees usually rate to provide a useful and exciting forum for information technology professionals (e.g., standards developers, software developers, security engineers, security officers) to exchange ideas, concerns, and opinions.  
 Artifacts Competition   
 This competition invites the submission of applied cybersecurity artifacts that have been published in previous years in academic or industry venues. In particular, the competition aims to identify previously published applied security artifacts that have demonstrated meaningful impact for the security and privacy research communities. For instance, demonstrable impact may be represented by an artifact that has been reused in multiple subsequent publications by different research groups, that has received multiple "stars" and/or "forks" on platforms such as GitHub, or that has been successfully transitioned to a commercial technology.  
 Student Conferenceships   
 ACSAC offers conferenceships to enable students to attend the conference. This program will help pay for some of the cost to attend ACSAC.  
 General Submissions and Speaking Proposals  
 ACSAC does not accept "speaking proposals" per se, however; you are encouraged to submit suggestions in the form of a one paragraph description of a topic and a biography of the proposed presenter. Depending on a proposal's technical content, it may be acceptable as a case study. If a full paper is available, it may be acceptable as a technical paper. If a presentation by a group of related speakers is contemplated, a proposal for this session may be acceptable as a panel. If a proposal for a half day or full day seminar is appropriate, it may be acceptable as a professional development course. If a one or two page technical write-up is available that describes work that is not yet completed, it may be acceptable as a poster. Finally, if your have an interest in a full day interactive dialogue, exchanging ideas, opinions and concerns between multiple presenters and attendees, consider being a workshop presenter.

 ACSAC solicits papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security research. We encourage papers with results that are demonstrably useful for improving cybersecurity and that address lessons learned from practical applications. In particular, we encourage the submission of papers related to our hard topic theme: Security Applications of Generative AI  . Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published elsewhere or that have been simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with proceedings and are under review.  
   
 Make Submission   
 ** New this year **  Reproduction and Replication (R+R) Papers:  Security research is often criticized for the poor reproducibility of its results, a situation we aim to address through artifact evaluation. At the same time, reproduction and replication studies are often undervalued in academic publishing. Thus, in addition to regular papers and artifact evaluations, this year we are also soliciting studies that confirm, question, or clarify the results of previous research. These papers must contain the prefix “R+R:” in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.  
 We encourage submissions to follow the ACM guidelines on reproducibility  (different team, same experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-use) and replicability  (different team, different experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-implementation). Note, however, that submissions need to go beyond re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper(s) or re-implementing their approach. We are looking for submissions that not only replicate existing studies but also critically assess, clarify and extend their findings and limitations. This includes, but is not limited to, the verification of existing research results, ensuring their validity and reliability across different contexts, lessons learned when applying research results in real-world (industry) settings, and the adaption of artifacts to contemporary cybersecurity challenges.  
 Reproduction and replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as original technical papers, will be reviewed by the full program committee, will appear in the proceedings, and will be presented at the conference as part of the technical program. We also particularly encourage these types of papers to provide their artifacts.  
 Review Process:  Paper submissions will be judged based on novelty, relevance to the conference topics, technical correctness, quality of the evaluation, and presentation clarity. Papers will undergo a double-blind review process in two rounds. At the end of Round 1, papers for which a strong consensus towards rejection is reached will be notified of the early rejection decision, giving them the opportunity to improve their paper based on the reviewers’ feedback and to resubmit to other venues. Papers that advance to Round 2 will be assigned additional reviewers. At the end of Round 2, the authors of papers that advanced to this stage will have an opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and comments. After the authors' response period, the papers will be further discussed by the Program Committee (PC) to reach a final decision.  
 Three outcomes are possible: Accepted, Minor Revision, and Rejected. The Minor Revision decision is reserved to papers that can be considered as conditionally accepted, assuming improvements required by the reviewers are made within the available revision time window and are approved by the PC. A PC member will be assigned as shepherd for Minor Revision papers, to guide the authors through the revision process and to lead the discussion on the revised paper among the reviewers. The revision requirements may include both presentation improvements and additional experiments that the PC believes are necessary to significantly improve the paper and that should be feasible within a limited time frame. While Minor Revision papers that do not meet the required changes may be rejected, the expectation is that most papers will be able to satisfy the required improvements and be finally accepted into the conference program. Both the author's responses and the discussions around revision requirements for Minor Revision papers will be handled anonymously, via the paper submission system.  
 Paper Artifacts:  Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to submit their software and data artifacts for formal evaluation by the Artifacts Evaluation Committee  and to make them publicly available to the entire community. During submission, authors of papers whose main contributions and experimental results rely primarily on new or reproduced artifacts (e.g., code and/or data) should indicate whether they will separately submit their artifacts for evaluation, if their paper is accepted. This acknowledgement will be visible to the reviewers and may therefore be taken into consideration during the review process. Authors who have justifiable reasons to not submit their artifacts for evaluation (in case their paper is accepted) should add a comment in the corresponding comment box in the submission form. Additionally, during paper submission authors can optionally provide a URL pointing to a repository containing their paper artifacts. While artifacts will be formally evaluated only if the paper is accepted, as explained above, reviewers may also take into account the availability and quality of the paper artifacts during the main paper review process, before making a final decision (please refer to the paper submission form for additional details).  
 Important:  When preparing the artifacts repository for inclusion in the paper submission form, please take extra care to not include authors’ information in the repository or artifacts content, so as not to break the anonymity of the paper submission. Additional information and recommendations on anonymizing the artifacts repository can be found here  .  
 Ethical Considerations:  Papers that might raise ethical concerns (e.g., papers that use human subjects, leverage potentially sensitive data, or describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems) must include an Ethical Considerations section that properly describes what procedures have been followed to minimize potential harm. Such papers should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties, whether an institutional ethics committee reviewed the research, or how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software/system vendors or owners before publication.  
 Paper Format:  Please ensure that your submission consists of a PDF file of no more than 10 double-column pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to a maximum of 5 pages. The full PDF document must not exceed a total of 15 pages. Please note that PC members are not required to read the appendices and that page limits will be strictly enforced.  
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to the dual anonymous review process. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. In the rare case that citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs.  
 Submission Process:  Submissions must be generated using the double-column ACM format (see template available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  ) using the [sigconf, anonymous]  options. Submissions should not use older ACM templates (e.g., sig-alternate). All papers must be submitted exclusively through the ACSAC 2024 paper submission system. Note that paper title and abstract registration is not necessary ahead of the paper submission.  
 All formatting guidelines and constraints (e.g., page limits and anonymity) will be strictly enforced. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

 This year’s conference was a great success, thanks to the quality of the papers presented and the outstanding efforts of the authors, special session organizers, session chairs, and invited speakers. We look forward to seeing you again in 2025!  
  Conference Presentation/Publication Policy  
 The proceedings of the Asilomar conference are meant to be a written record of the presentations provided at the conference. In other words, these proceedings are not a medium for general publication of scientific results; rather, they serve a more specific and narrow purpose which is to summarize the discussions that occurred during the Conference.  
 It is the long-term Conference policy to restrict publication in the proceedings to papers which were presented live  at the conference by one of the registered  authors of the paper who is physically present at the conference. There is no exception to this policy.  
 No more than 4 papers (combination of invited and regular) papers per author or co-author will be accepted for presentation at the conference or published in the proceedings.  
 The conference executive committee and IEEE reserve the right to exclude a final paper submission from inclusion in the conference proceedings, if the final paper submission does not meet conference or IEEE standards for scope and/or quality.  
  The Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers is a yearly Conference held on the Asilomar Grounds in Pacific Grove CA, USA. The IEEE Signal Processing Society is a technical co-sponsor. It provides a forum for presenting recent and novel work in various areas of theoretical and applied signal processing.  
 General areas of interest to the forum include:  
 Architectures & Implementation 
  Array Signal Processing 
  Biomedical Signal & Image Processing 
  Communication Systems 
  MIMO Communications & Signal Processing 
  Networks & Graphs 
  Signal Processing & Adaptive Systems 
  Machine Learning & Data Analytics 
  Speech, Image & Video Processing 
   
 Recent meetings have presented a wide array of work ranging from results in MIMO communications, array processing, low dimensional signal models, blind source separation, tensor models, stochastic optimization, online and distributed learning, and signal processing over graphs to applications of signal processing in control, wireless communications, financial engineering, smart grids, biological systems, medical imaging, and big data.

 NDSS Symposium 2017 Call for Papers  
   
 The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium fosters information exchange among researchers and practitioners of network and distributed system security. The target audience includes those interested in practical aspects of network and distributed system security, with a focus on actual system design and implementation. A major goal is to encourage and enable the Internet community to apply, deploy, and advance the state of available security technologies.  
 Technical papers and panel proposals are solicited. All submissions will be reviewed by the Program Committee and accepted submissions will be published by the Internet Society in the Proceedings of NDSS 2017. The Proceedings will be made freely accessible from the Internet Society webpages. Furthermore, permission to freely reproduce all or parts of papers for noncommercial purposes is granted provided that copies bear the Internet Society notice included in the first page of the paper. The authors are therefore free to post the camera-ready versions of their papers on their personal pages and within their institutional repositories. Reproduction for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and requires prior consent.

  Paper Formatting  
 Technical papers submitted for NDSS should be written in English. Papers must not exceed 15 pages in total (including the references and appendices). Papers must be formatted for US letter size (not A4) paper in a two-column layout, with columns no more than 9.25 in. high and 3.5 in. wide. The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing. Authors must use the NDSS templates. These templates may be updated by 1 July 2016. Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. Documents should render correctly in Adobe Reader when printed in black and white.  
 Double and Concurrent Submissions  
 Technical papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings. Double-submission will result in immediate rejection. The Program Committee may share information with other conference chairs and journal editors so as to detect such cases.  
 Ethical Considerations  
 If a paper relates to human subjects, analyzes data derived from human subjects, may put humans at risk, or might have other ethical implications or introduce legal issues of potential concern to the NDSS community, authors should disclose if an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval) was conducted, and discuss in the paper how ethical and legal concerns were addressed. If the paper reports a potentially high-impact vulnerability the authors should discuss their plan for responsible disclosure. The chairs will contact the authors in case of major concerns. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.

 NDSS implements a double-blind reviewing process. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliation in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.  
 Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Advisors and advisees, as well as authors and PC members with an institutional relationship are considered to share a conflict of interest. Professional collaborations (irrespective of whether they resulted in a publication) that occurred in the past 3 years and close personal relationships equally constitute a conflict of interest. PC members, including chairs that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. The PC chair and shadow chair are not allowed to submit to the conference. Declaring conflicts of interest in order to prevent submissions from being reviewed by selected PC members is not allowed and can constitute grounds for rejection. If authors have concerns about the fair treatment of their submissions, they should instead contact the chairs and provide convincing arguments for any special consideration that they are requesting.  
 Early Rejection Notification  
 The review process will consist of several reviewing rounds. In order to allow authors time to improve their work and submit to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified earlier (tentatively by 20 September 2016).  
 Papers that are not accepted as full technical papers may be invited by the Program Committee to be presented at the conference as short talks. Extended abstracts of such papers will appear on the Internet Society website but not in the proceedings. Priority will be given to papers that have fresh, unconventional ideas.  
 Panel Proposals  
 Panel proposals should be one page and must describe the topic, identify the panel chair, explain the panel format, and list three to four potential panelists. A description of each panel will appear on the Internet Society website but not in the proceedings, and may, at the discretion of the panel chair, include written position statements from the panelists.  
 Submission Site and Contact

 General Information     
   
 ADBIS conferences provide an international platform for the presentation of research on database theory, development of advanced DBMS technologies, solutions for data engineering and analytics, and their advanced applications. The main objective of the ADBIS series of conferences is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote interaction and collaboration among the database, information systems, data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning communities from European countries and the rest of the world. ADBIS 2024 will consist of regular sessions with technical contributions reviewed and selected by an international program committee, as well as of invited keynote and tutorial talks presented by leading scientists.  
 For the second consecutive time in the ADBIS series, ADBIS 2024 considers a shepherding phase to help authors of borderline papers improve their papers.  

 Topics     
   
 We invite the submission of original research contributions addressing core data management tasks, as well as techniques and technologies in the following broad areas of data management:  
 Database Management Systems 
  Information Systems Architectures and Data Services 
  Management and Mining of Heterogeneous Data Types 
  Big Data Management and Analytics 
  Scalable Data Science 
  Responsible Data Science

 Paper Submission, Publishing, and Awards     
   
 The organizers of ADBIS 2024 invite original papers (not submitted elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to the aforementioned list of topics. Both short and long paper submissions are accepted.  
 LONG papers can be:  
 Regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, data structures, and system architectures for the management of data; 
  Experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the algorithm/system/method being assessed. 
  SHORT papers can be:  
 Early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and discussion of early research results, that include early experimental findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the difficulties being faced towards full fruition; 
  Vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for data management in important areas related to the scope of the conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant. 

 Submission Guidelines and Instructions     
   
 The page limits are as follows:  
 LONG (research or experimental) papers: 14 LNCS style pages; 
  SHORT (early findings or visionary) papers: up to 10 LNCS style pages. 
  Papers should be submitted in PDF format using the EasyChair  online submission system.  
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines  and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection.

The shepherding process will involve: authors will be given a list of issues/improvements that have to be addressed within 2 weeks’ time; authors improve the paper addressing these concerns; authors submit the revised paper in camera-ready format; the PC chairs ultimately decide whether the revised paper is acceptable as is or not to the final program.  
  
 The schedule for shepherding is as follows:  
 Notification of shepherding status: | June 10, 2024 
  Authors submit revised, camera-ready version: | June 25, 2024 
  Notification of acceptance for shepherded papers: | June 30, 2024 
  Camera-ready documents and copyright: | July 05, 2024 

 Awards     
   
 ADBIS 2024 will award the Best Conference Paper Award and the Best Doctoral Symposium Paper Award, each receiving a 500 EUR prize sponsored by Springer.  

 Special Issue     
   
 The best papers of the conference will be invited to special issues in top tier journals (TBA), to be organized after the conference.  

 Diversity and Inclusion     
   
 GRANTS. In line with previous editions, and to foster a broad inclusion, the conference will provide two participation grants (registration waiving) for two students from East European Countries. To the extent possible, every effort will be made to potentially increase this number.  
 D&I INITIATIVE. The ADBIS community believes that diversity and culture of support encourage retention and attraction of talent, promote diversity of thought and perspective, and help make the scientific community more flexible and responsive in times of change. For these reasons, ADBIS 2024 continues to participate in the Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) initiative of the Database community aiming to guide researchers in our community to adopt a more inclusive mindset in general toward different individuals regardless of their age, gender, gender identity, race, cultural background, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, parental and marital status, etc. If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or complaints, please email the ADBIS 2024 Diversity and Inclusion chairs.

 WELCOME  
 We are delighted to host the Australasian Diabetes Congress at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, August 20 - 22, 2025. The content will once again be exceptional.  
 The program organising committees of both societies have collaboratively developed an integrated program that will cover the latest breakthroughs in research, education and clinical care in diabetes.  
 We have engaged outstanding speakers with whom you will be able to network to exchange opinions and discuss how to best care for the person living with diabetes.  
 We are excited to provide you with opportunities to see old colleagues, meet new ones and connect again with our industry partners in the exhibition hall. This year’s Congress will be an in-person only event with no virtual attendance option.  
 We look forward to seeing you on the Gold Coast in 2025.

 ADEA & ADS CEOs

 CONCEPT  

          Programme Agenda      

 The Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) industry is poised for a transformative leap, with a surge of deals, innovations, and collaborations spotlighting Asia as the hub for next-generation ADC development. Asia is leading the way in advancing beyond traditional biosimilars, delving into novel payloads, conjugation technologies, and linkers. This heightened interest in ADCs is driven by the rising global incidence of cancer, which increases the demand for advanced therapeutic options. Breakthroughs in antibody technology are significantly boosting ADC efficacy and specificity, opening new possibilities for targeted treatments. This progress is bolstered by escalating investments and a growing number of FDA approvals, highlighting the field's potential and gaining regulatory confidence.    
 Despite these exciting developments, the ADC sector faces critical challenges that demand innovative solutions and strategic planning. High development costs, intricate manufacturing processes, and potential toxicities are notable hurdles that require thoughtful strategies to overcome.    
 ADC Asia Congress 2025   will provide a crucial platform that will bring together pioneers and key opinion leaders across mega-pharma and biotechnology focusing on Singapore, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and the rest of Asia Pacific to discuss the latest technological innovations, clinical development, strategic collaborations, and common hurdles in the development of ADCs in the region.    
 Event Highlights:   
 Hear from 40+ leading industry experts and visionaries in the ADC field from Singapore, China, Japan, South Korea, and Australia on the latest advancements and future directions of Antibody Drug Conjugates. 
  Engage with 300+ attendees to explore forward-looking perspectives on ADC research and development and discover how strategic collaborations can drive innovation. 
  Delve into Asia-Pacific-specific challenges and opportunities in ADC development.

  *Australasian Document Computing Symposium 2021 (ADCS 2021)*  
  Virtual Seminar Series  
  http://adcs-conference.org/2021/  
  ADCS 2021 is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners in document computing and information retrieval to meet and present their work. The symposium aims to cover all aspects of Document Computing - issues ranging from the fundamentals of document architectures and standards for markup, through storage, management, retrieval, authentication and workflow, to active and virtual documents. The symposium emphasises both commercial and academic issues by encouraging a variety of submissions.  
  Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ADCS will run as a *virtual seminar series* with weekly presentations from December 2021 into 2022.  
  *Topics of Interest*  
  The symposium topics include (but are not restricted to) the following:  
  * Cognitive Aspects of Documents  
  * Digital Libraries  
  * Document Databases  
  * Document Standards (XML, SGML, etc.)  
  * Document Summarisation  
  * Enterprise Search  
  * Evaluation  
  * Human Factors in Search and Retrieval  
  * Interactive Information Retrieval  
  * Multimedia Document Management  
  * Multimedia Resource Discovery  
  * Natural Language Techniques and Documents  
  * Personalised Documents  
  * Retrieval Models and Ranking  
  * Search Engine Architectures and Scalability  
  * User Studies Involving Documents and Information Access Systems  
  * Web Documents  
  * Web Search  
  *Submissions*  
  ADCS 2021 will not differentiate between “full” and “short” papers, adopting the successful approach trialled at ICTIR 2021. Instead, papers must be between 2 and 9 pages for content, with unlimited additional pages allowed for references. That is, the minimum submission length is 2 pages plus references, and the maximum submission length is 9 pages plus references.  
  Papers should be written such that the length is proportional to the contribution.  
  *Full details* on formatting, submission, and reviewing can be found on the ADCS 2021 website: http://adcs-conference.org/2021/  
  *Important Dates*  
  * Paper submission deadline: 22 October 2021 11.59pm AoE  
  * Notification of acceptance: 12 November 2021  
  * Camera ready: 22 November 2021  
  * Conference presentations: TBA in a Weekly time slot from December 2021 into 2022.
