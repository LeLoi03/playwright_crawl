 Welcome to ISMIS 2024  
 27th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems  
 17-19 June 2024, Poitiers / Futuroscope, France üá´üá∑  

   ISMIS is an established and prestigious conference for exchanging the latest research results in building intelligent systems. It provides a basis for exchanging research results and transferring scientific achievements towards industrial and socio-economic applications. The scope of ISMIS is to present a wide range of topics related to the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques related to areas such as decision support, knowledge-based systems, machine learning, robotics planning, computer vision, databases, information retrieval configuration, and diagnosis. The conference also focuses on interdisciplinary research in AI-related fields, for example, decision support systems, human decision-making, recommender systems and personalization, knowledge-based systems development, cognitive aspects of knowledge understanding.  
     
 Conference Scope  
 This year‚Äôs conference theme spans over two main directions: ‚Äúthe concepts and metrics to evaluate the explainability of AI systems‚Äù and ‚Äúthe principles of responsible AI". With this focus, ISMIS 2024 aims at contributing to emerging challenges relative to the development of a new generation of fair and ethical AI systems capable of both ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù and ‚Äúbe understandable by‚Äù humans, adapting to complex real-world environments, appropriately interacting in complex social settings mitigating possible cyber-threats and vulnerabilities, and aligning with Environmental, Social and Governance principles. The increased relevance of areas such as Autonomous Systems, Financial Services and Cybersecurity and sensitive application domains such as Medicine, Manufacturing Education, Earth Observation, Intelligent Maintenance and Military require systems with high accuracy, robustness, accountability, fairness privacy/security, transparency, interpretability, and ethics.  
 ISMIS 2024 is intended to attract academics, researchers and practitioners who are actively engaged both in theoretical and practical aspects of intelligent systems. The goal is to provide a platform for a useful exchange between theoreticians and practitioners, and to foster the cross-fertilization of ideas. Relevant conference topics include but are not limited to:  
 Explainable AI (XAI)

 Ethics  
 Ethics is one of the most important topics to emerge in machine learning and data mining. We ask you to think about the ethical implications of your submission such as, e.g., related to the collection and processing of personal data, the inference of personal information, or the potential sensitive use of your work. which will be taken into consideration by the reviewers. As part of your submission, you are invited to include, if applicable, an ethical statement that discusses any ethical implications of your work.  
 Dual Submission Policy  
 Papers submitted should report original work. Papers that are identical or substantially similar to papers that have been published or submitted elsewhere may not be submitted to ISMIS, and the organizers will reject such papers without review. Authors are also not allowed to submit their papers elsewhere during the review period. Submitting unpublished technical reports available online (such as on arXiv), or papers presented in workshops without formal proceedings, is allowed.  
 Authorship  
 The author list as submitted with the paper is considered final. No changes to this list may be made after paper submission, either during the reviewing period or, in case of acceptance, at the final camera-ready stage.

  The double-blind review process applies to all submissions | ( see ISC High Performance Double-Blind Review Guidelines  ). | Please refrain from including names, affiliations, funding sources, or acknowledgments in the heading or body of the document. Authors should cite their own work in a third-party manner rather than redacting the citations. 
  Papers submitted for the Research Papers track should not have been previously published or under peer review for a different venue. Papers pre-posted to arXiv, institutional repositories, and personal websites remain eligible for submission. 
  Membership on a program committee does not inherently create a conflict of interest in submitting a paper. 

 Review Process   
        Each paper is expected to receive a minimum of 3 to 4 reviews 
  Papers will be evaluated based on novelty, fundamental insights, clarity of presentation, and potential for long-term impact 
  Reviewers will provide constructive, actionable feedback that can be used to improve the paper, whether it is eventually accepted or not 
  The Research Paper Committee reserves the right to reject incorrectly formatted papers 

  Rebuttal Phase   
        Initial reviewer comments will be made available to the authors by the committee 
  Authors can respond to clarify misunderstandings and answer questions 
  Rebuttals will be submitted in written format and will have a tight deadline 
  Authors will receive additional instructions via email 

  Final Decision   
        The paper‚Äôs track committee will consider all reviews and rebuttals 
  Live reviewer discussions will occur during the research paper committee meeting 
  A consensus-driven approach will be used to select the strongest papers 
  Notification of the papers‚Äô outcomes will be sent to authors after the program committee‚Äôs meeting 

 Terms & Conditions  

 The research paper sessions will be held from June 10-12, 2025. 
  By submitting a research paper, you agree that one of the authors will present the work in person at ISC 2025.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Important changes in 2024.   We are excited to announce an expanded scope of ISMM this year to encourage submissions and participation from related fields such as computer architecture and computer systems in addition to our core PL community!   
 The 2024 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2024) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware  , as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results. In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds:  
 Surveys and comparative analyses that shed new light on previously published techniques. 
  Practitioner reports, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published. 
  Intellectual abstracts, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated. 
  Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include on of the following on the line below the title line: \subtitle{This submission is a regular paper}  , \subtitle{This submission is a survey}  , \subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report}  , or \subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}  .  
 ISMM 2024 will be colocated with PLDI 2024  .  
 Areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Garbage collection algorithms and implementations 
  Memory allocation and de-allocation 
  Memory system design and analysis 
  Hardware support for memory management 
  Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems 
  Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales 
  Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms 
  Compiler analyses to aid memory management 
  Tools to analyze memory usage of programs 
  Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs 
  Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs 
  Memory management for machine learning systems 
  Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories 
  Caches 
  Cache coherence and memory consistency 
  Processing in memory and near memory processing 
  Memory device architectures (SRAM, DRAM, flash, NVM) 
  Security and privacy of memory systems 
  Reliability of memory systems 
  The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments.  
 Submission Link

 Formatting Instructions   
 All papers must be submitted on-line in Portable Document Format (PDF).  
 Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliography, in 10pt font. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]  . Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. These requirements are all the same as in the previous years.  
 Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.  
 Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.  
 Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below.  
 As explained in more detail at http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author  , authors should use the sigplan subformat of the acmart format. Please note the following: The first two lines should be:  
 \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart} \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}   The default citation style is numeric. Do not  mess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space. (Conversely, you may toggle the printccs and printacmref flags if you wish, but these changes will consume space.) Do not  use the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them. However, the template files were designed to make migrating a paper from one format to the other as simple as possible.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 ISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.  
 PLDI‚Äôs FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double blind rules, please contact the Program Chair. If in any doubt you should contact the Program Chair for complex cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ.  
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Publication Date   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Author Response   
 The author response process will occur in April 2024 (see Important Dates on the main page  ), and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions. The committee may, but need not, respond to the author response or revise reviews at or after the committee meeting.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Important changes in 2024.   We are excited to announce an expanded scope of ISMM this year to encourage submissions and participation from related fields such as computer architecture and computer systems in addition to our core PL community!   
 The 2024 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2024) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware  , as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results. In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds:  
 Surveys and comparative analyses that shed new light on previously published techniques. 
  Practitioner reports, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published. 
  Intellectual abstracts, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated. 
  Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include on of the following on the line below the title line: \subtitle{This submission is a regular paper}  , \subtitle{This submission is a survey}  , \subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report}  , or \subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}  .  
 ISMM 2024 will be colocated with PLDI 2024  .  
 Areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Garbage collection algorithms and implementations 
  Memory allocation and de-allocation 
  Memory system design and analysis 
  Hardware support for memory management 
  Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems 
  Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales 
  Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms 
  Compiler analyses to aid memory management 
  Tools to analyze memory usage of programs 
  Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs 
  Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs 
  Memory management for machine learning systems 
  Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories 
  Caches 
  Cache coherence and memory consistency 
  Processing in memory and near memory processing 
  Memory device architectures (SRAM, DRAM, flash, NVM) 
  Security and privacy of memory systems 
  Reliability of memory systems 
  The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments.  
 Submission Link   
 https://ismm24.hotcrp.com   
 Formatting Instructions   
 All papers must be submitted on-line in Portable Document Format (PDF).  
 Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliography, in 10pt font. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]  . Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. These requirements are all the same as in the previous years.  
 Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.  
 Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.  
 Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below.  
 As explained in more detail at http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author  , authors should use the sigplan subformat of the acmart format. Please note the following: The first two lines should be:  
 \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart} \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}   The default citation style is numeric. Do not  mess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space. (Conversely, you may toggle the printccs and printacmref flags if you wish, but these changes will consume space.) Do not  use the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them. However, the template files were designed to make migrating a paper from one format to the other as simple as possible.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 ISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.  
 PLDI‚Äôs FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double blind rules, please contact the Program Chair. If in any doubt you should contact the Program Chair for complex cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ.  
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Publication Date   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Author Response   
 The author response process will occur in April 2024 (see Important Dates on the main page  ), and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions. The committee may, but need not, respond to the author response or revise reviews at or after the committee meeting.

 Welcome to  IEEE  ISNCC 202  4  !     
 The  11th IEEE  International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC'2  4  ) will be held  in  Washington DC- USA  , from  October 2  2  to  25  , 202  4  .   
 The conference is  hosted  by the prestigious    University of the District of Columbia    -Washington DC  .   
 ISNCC 2024 is technically co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Communications Society and supported by its Big Data, Satellite & Space Communications and Communications Software Technical Committees.   
 ISNCC 2024   covers theoretical and practical aspects related to Information Systems, Communication Networks and Computing Technologies. This year, the multi-thematic program focuses on the major future scientific issues for the following scientific topics (details in "  Call For Papers   "):   
 Internet of Everything and Smart Cities 
  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
  Generative AI for Education 
  Industry 4.0 and the Factory of the Future 
  Metaverse and the Future of Internet 
  Data Science and Big Data Systems Engineering 
  5G exploitation and 6G Vision: State of Art and Key Technologies 
  Satellite Communications and Space Internet 
  Deep Space Exploration and Long-Distance Communication 
  Next Generation Networking and Internet 
  Trust, Security and Privacy 
  Cloud, Computing, Networking and Storage 
  Wireless and Mobile Networks 
  Antenna Systems, Propagation and RF Design 
  Green Communication Systems and Networks 
  Signal Processing and Communication System Theory 
  A separated Track called "  PhD Students' Forum  " provides an opportunity for research students to showcase their original yet incomplete ‚Äòwork-in-progress‚Äô (more details in ‚Äú  PhD Students' Forum   ‚Äù).   
 Also an "  Industrial Forum  " is foreseen to give particular visibility and emphasis of applied research and on industrial developments. For this track to prepare full paper is not mandatory but the same slot for presentation at the conference will be guaranteed. The submission procedure through EDAS is the same of the scientific track but just an abstract could be accepted (more details in "  Industrial Forum   ").   
 The ISNCC 202  4  edition will propose a set of technical presentations made ‚Äã‚Äãby internationally recognized researchers and experts. Young researchers participating in this event will then have the opportunity to present their work and obtain feedback during dedicated sessions intended to further facilitate interactions and the exchange of ideas.   
 The target audience of ISNCC ranges from Senior researchers to   Ph.D. and Master students. Researchers and engineers from companies are welcome, and may greatly benefit from the broad vision provided by this symposium.   
 ISNCC 2024 will be held in  Hybrid  mode (virtual or in-person presentation). A  uthors who will not be able to travel, will be allowed to upload their presentations and present them virtually.   
 Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into  IEEE Xplore  subject to meeting IEEE Xplore‚Äôs scope and quality requirements  .   
 Please download the [  PDF Version   ]  of the Call For Papers.   
 Submission instructions:  https://www.isncc-conf.org/submissions 
  Submit your paper(s):   [  https://edas.info/N31953   ]

 Call for Papers  
  
 The 2023 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2023) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics, as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results. In additional to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds:  
 Surveys and comparative analyses that shed new light on previously published techniques. 
  Practitioner reports, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published. 
  Intellectual abstracts, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated. 
  Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include on of the following on the line below the title line: \subtitle{This submission is a regular paper}  , \subtitle{This submission is a survey}  , \subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report}  , or \subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}  .  
 ISMM 2023 will be colocated with PLDI 2023  at FCRC‚Äô23  .  
 Areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Garbage collection algorithms and implementations 
  Memory allocation and de-allocation 
  Memory system design and analysis 
  Hardware support for memory management 
  Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems 
  Novel memory architectures 
  Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales 
  Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms 
  Compiler analyses to aid memory management 
  Tools to analyze memory usage of programs 
  Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs 
  Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs 
  Memory management for machine learning systems 
  Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories 
  The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments.  
 Formatting Instructions   
 All papers must be submitted on-line in Portable Document Format (PDF).  
 Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliography, in 10pt font. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]  . Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. These requirements are all the same as in the previous years.  
 Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.  
 Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.  
 Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below.  
 As explained in more detail at http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author  , authors should use the sigplan subformat of the acmart format. Please note the following: The first two lines should be:  
 \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart} \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}   The default citation style is numeric. Do not  mess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space. (Conversely, you may toggle the printccs and printacmref flags if you wish, but these changes will consume space.) Do not  use the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them. However, the template files were designed to make migrating a paper from one format to the other as simple as possible.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 ISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.  
 PLDI‚Äôs FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double blind rules, please contact the Program Chair. If in any doubt you should contact the Program Chair for complex cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ.  
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Publication Date   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Author Response   
 The author response process will occur in April 2023 (see Important Dates on the main page  ), and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions. The committee may, but need not, respond to the author response or revise reviews at or after the committee meeting.

 Speaker's Guide  
   
 ISMM‚Äô23 Speaker‚Äôs Guide   
 This document is for those presenting a paper at ISMM‚Äô23.  
 Congratulations on having your paper accepted at ISMM‚Äô23! This document will help ensure your presentation runs smoothly and has the best possible audience impact. Please read it in its entirety.  
 Checklist   
 Before ISMM:  
 Prepare and | practice | . 
  Ensure your talk runs for | no more than 16 minutes | . 
  Sign up for Discord | ( | details here | ). 
  Upload a backup copy of your talk slides | (details below). 
  Check the program | to establish when and where your talk will be. 
  Ensure you have a HDMI adaptor  for your device. 
  Before your talk:  
 Familiarize yourself with the room | you will be speaking in (Magnolia 22). 
  Find and | introduce yourself to your session chair | . 
  Find the Discord channel | for your session, so you can monitor questions. 
  Attend the video check | before your session (details below). 
  Ensure that you are in the room no later than 5 minutes before your session. 
  After your talk:  
 Expect | questions from the floor | and session chair. 
  Once you‚Äôve completed your talk and Q&A, | monitor Discord for follow-up questions | . 
  Preparing Your Talk   
 Your work will have a greater impact if you‚Äôre well prepared.  
 It is very important that you run to schedule. The ISMM‚Äô23 schedule is extremely tight, with hard stops imposed by FCRC scheduling. Session chairs have been asked to stick rigidly to the schedule.  
 Guidelines   
 Your talk should run for no more than 16 minutes | , uninterrupted. This gives you about three minutes for questions and one minute for speaker change-over. 
  Your talk should be prepared for the standard | 16:9 widescreen ratio | . If your talk is in a different ratio, at best it will be | pillarboxed | , wasting screen real estate and diminishing impact, and at worst, it won‚Äôt display correctly. 
  You will present your talk from a lectern, using a fixed lectern mic. 
  You will need to provide your talk ahead of time in either pdf or powerpoint. 
  If you have an embedded video in your presentation, please inform the video team during your mandatory video check before your session. 
  Uploading Your Presentation   
 As an insurance against technical failures, we ask all speakers to make a backup copy of their presentation available to the video team by uploading it the day before the session. You‚Äôre welcome to upload fresh copies at any time.  
 Format: your presentation must be saved as a powerpoint or pdf file (sorry!) 
  Naming: you must use your paper ID as your file name (e.g. <ismm paper ID>.[ppt,pptx,pdf]) 
  Location: please use this link: | https://bit.ly/pldi23upload 
  This requirement gives you assurance that if some major technical problem were to arise (such as a failure of your laptop), you will still be able to give your talk. If you do not make your presentation available in advance, and significant technical problems arise, we may have to shorten your presentation to keep to our tight schedule.  
 The requirement for you to use pdf or powerpoint for your backup copy is a pragmatic tradeoff. These slides will only be used in case of a technical emergency. We want to have the highest possible assurance that they will work without fuss on a third party device should such an emergency occur. If you use Google slides, Keynote, or some other software, please use the export feature to create either powerpoint or pdf backups.  
 If you elect not to upload a backup copy, please understand that this limits our volunteers‚Äô capacity to assist you if a technical problem arises when you give your presentation.  
 Advice   
 There are many excellent sources of advice on giving good talks, including from Simon Peyton Jones  , Michael Hicks  , Michael Ernst  , Ranjit Jhala  , and Derek Dreyer  . Make good use of these!  
 Mandatory Video Check   
 All speakers are required to be in the room and check in with their session chair and the video team no later than 5 minutes before their session starts. Please note that due to our very tight schedule, speakers who fail to upload their talk in advance and/or fail to attend the video check 5 minutes before their session may have their talk cut short if technical issues arise  .  
 Q&A   
 If you stick to the above schedule you will have about 3 minutes for questions. The in-room audience will be able to ask questions via a queue at a single microphone on a mic stand in the center of the room. In-room attendees and remote attendees will also be able to ask questions via Discord. Your session chair will monitor questions on Discord and might ask questions as they see them appearing there.  
 It is good practice, as the speaker, to repeat your understanding of the question before providing your answer. This is particularly important when time is tight because it reduces opportunities for time being wasted on account of a misunderstanding.  
 Once your talk is finished, please go on to Discord and respond to any questions or follow-up questions that appear there.  
 Remote Audience   
 Your talk will be streamed to Discord and YouTube. Your remote audience will be able to write questions in the Discord channel created for your session (they won‚Äôt be able to ask questions via audio or video). They should see your slides, and a video feed of you speaking. As mentioned above, your session chair may relay questions from Discord.  
 Remote Presenters   
 ISMM‚Äô23 authors are expected to be present at the conference.

  Authors may include as many pages of appendices as they wish, but reviewers are not required to read these. If you wish to include an appendix, please add it after your references and keep in mind the double blind guidelines. 
  If any content in the Research Paper is generated using Artificial Intelligence tools, authors must transparently and thoroughly describe their use in the methods, acknowledgment, or equivalent section of the paper. Description is not necessary for tools used solely for improving spelling, grammar, and general editing. Authors are accountable for the accuracy of information provided by AI tools and for referencing any supporting work based on that information. 
  The double-blind review process applies to all submissions | ( see ISC High Performance Double-Blind Review Guidelines  ). | Please refrain from including names, affiliations, funding sources, or acknowledgments in the heading or body of the document. Authors should cite their own work in a third-party manner rather than redacting the citations. 
  Papers submitted for the Research Papers track should not have been previously published or under peer review for a different venue. Papers pre-posted to arXiv, institutional repositories, and personal websites remain eligible for submission. 
  Membership on a program committee does not inherently create a conflict of interest in submitting a paper. 

 Review Process   
        Each paper is expected to receive a minimum of 3 to 4 reviews 
  Papers will be evaluated based on novelty, fundamental insights, clarity of presentation, and potential for long-term impact 
  Reviewers will provide constructive, actionable feedback that can be used to improve the paper, whether it is eventually accepted or not 
  The Research Paper Committee reserves the right to reject incorrectly formatted papers 

  Rebuttal Phase   
        Initial reviewer comments will be made available to the authors by the committee 
  Authors can respond to clarify misunderstandings and answer questions 
  Rebuttals will be submitted in written format and will have a tight deadline 
  Authors will receive additional instructions via email 

  Final Decision   
        The paper‚Äôs track committee will consider all reviews and rebuttals 
  Live reviewer discussions will occur during the research paper committee meeting 
  A consensus-driven approach will be used to select the strongest papers 
  Notification of the papers‚Äô outcomes will be sent to authors after the program committee‚Äôs meeting 

 Terms & Conditions  

 The research paper sessions will be held from June 10-12, 2025. 
  By submitting a research paper, you agree that one of the authors will present the work in person at ISC 2025.

 About ISoLA  
  The ISoLA Symposium is a forum for developers, users, and researchers to discuss issues related to the adoption and use of rigorous tools for the specification, analysis, verification, certification, construction, test, and maintenance of systems from the point of view of their different application domains. To bridge the gap between designers and developers of (formal methods based) rigorous tools, and users in engineering and in other disciplines, it fosters and exploits synergetic relationships among scientists, engineers, software developers, decision makers, and other critical thinkers.  

  The intended character of ISoLA  
  ISoLA aims at a thematically coherent program with maximum value for the participants. In particular we want to be attractive for people with practice background, who come to ISoLA to orient themselves concerning the leading edge technologies and their impact on their fields, to get ideas for new directions, and to establish (international) cooperations. Track organizers are therefore encouraged to invite appropriate experts in the field, which are able to present their ideas and results in an impact-oriented fashion, illustrating the potential of their area of competence and of their current research in a way that is accessible by the people in need for new solutions.Thus an important intended outcome is an intensified dialogue between research and (industrial) application, a goal that is also reflected in the organizational structure: sessions consist of 20-minute talks on related subjects with a 30 minute concluding panel discussion, which underlines our symposium-like intention.

 Scope    

 The 45 th  IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss and exchange cutting edge ideas as well as the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will be held over July 20-23 rd  , 2025 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025.  

 Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:  

  Cloud Computing 

  Distributed Algorithms 

  Big Data, Models & Systems 

  Distributed Fault Tolerance 

  Distributed OS and Middleware 

  Edge Computing 

  IoT + CPS 

  Mobile Computing 

  Security, Privacy and Trust 

  Blockchains/Databases 

  Distributed Systems for AI/ML 

  AI/ML for Distributed Systems 

  Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures 

 Paper Submission   

 The Paper strand provides  the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.  

 Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5‚Ä≥ x 11‚Ä≥ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template (downloadable by selecting ‚ÄúConferences‚Äù in the IEEE-Template Selector https://template-selector.ieee.org/  ). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages  (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.  

 The paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts and data needed for the reproduction of their results.  

 For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.  

 Note that the authors should adhere to ethic and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics  and IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text.   

 Note  : A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS)  . The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.

 QuAK: Quantitative Automata Kit  
  Abstract   
 System behaviors are traditionally evaluated through binary classifications of correctness, which do not suffice for properties involving quantitative aspects of systems and executions. Quantitative automata offer a more nuanced approach, mapping each execution to a real number by incorporating weighted transitions and value functions generalizing acceptance conditions. In this paper, we introduce QuAK, the first tool designed to automate the analysis of quantitative automata. QuAK currently supports a variety of quantitative automaton types, including \({\textsf{Inf}}\)  , \({\textsf{Sup}}\)  , \({\textsf{LimInf}}\)  , \({\textsf{LimSup}}\)  , \({\textsf{LimInfAvg}}\)  , and \({\textsf{LimSupAvg}}\)  automata, and implements decision procedures for problems such as emptiness, universality, inclusion, equivalence, as well as for checking whether an automaton is safe, live, or constant. Additionally, QuAK is able to compute extremal values when possible, construct safety-liveness decompositions, and monitor system behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QuAK through experiments focusing on the inclusion, constant-function check, and monitoring problems.

 Automating Software Re-Engineering Introduction to the ISoLA 2024 Track  
  Abstract   
 Formal approaches to software analysis and development tend to focus on greenfield scenarios or to look at some piece of given software as a static object. Dynamic evolution of software is a much more common and relevant issue, and its importance keeps growing. Key drivers are: (i) The advent of innovative execution platforms, including massively parallel and re-configurable hardware; (ii) emerging norms and regulations demanding software being re-engineered to comply with stricter legislation, new quality requirements, or ethical standards; (iii) the role of software in science (‚Äúin silico‚Äù now surpasses the more traditional ‚Äúin vitro‚Äù / ‚Äúin vivo‚Äù research methods); (iv) novel application scenarios for existing software (blockchain, micro-services, IoT, etc.), fueled by the digitalization of everything; (v) the growing importance of simulations as a tool to model, understand, and predict complex, dynamic behavior, specifically with a feedback loop to obtain a digital twin. Software refactoring, parallelization, and adaptation have become central activities in the value chain: Automating them can realize huge gains. Formal approaches to software modeling and analysis are poised to make a substantial contribution, because they are fundamentally concerned with automation and correctness. We invited researchers with an active interest in the automation of software re-engineering: People working on formal foundations, on tools, as well as practitioners of re-engineering. A special focus was to look at re-engineering of simulation software, digital twins, and of applications in IoT scenarios.

 On Using Large Language Models Pre-trained on Digital Twins as Oracles to Foster the Use of Formal Methods in Practice  
  Abstract   
 Formal methods based on formal logical or mathematical symbolic techniques provide the highest standards to analyse and ensure safety and security properties of cyber-physical systems‚Äîbut require a large overhead to specify and especially to verify system properties. The laborious and often manual and creative tasks consist of coming up with the appropriate specifications, to specify required lemmas or to guide the verification process. Once properties, lemmas, proof guidance or a proof itself is given, checking it rigorously for correctness is an easy task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a variety of domains, and there is a recent trend of research that tries to leverage that potential for the creative parts of formal verification. On the other hand, digital twins as virtual replicas of physical systems or processes are used to simulate and analyse real-world systems or scenarios, allowing for predictive maintenance, optimization, and testing of the systems. They can be used to predict and prevent failures, optimize processes, and test different designs in a virtual environment. They can also aid monitoring of real systems and offer support to adapt systems to new situations, e.g., in case of failures to simulate how to reestablish safe operations. Starting from examples of research results using LLMs for symbolic techniques, we advocate researching how to systematically design digital twins for systems under investigation, use simulation capabilities to explore system behaviours and assess their formal properties to create high-quality training data sets to pre-trained LLMs offline. Such LLMs shall then serve in specific verification tasks in practice, to take care of the difficult and, so far, manual task of generating appropriate candidate properties, lemmas or proofs that are subsequently automatically and efficiently checked for correctness using formal techniques.

 Cloud Continuum Digital Twins: Architectures of Solution, Open Technical Challenges, and Lessons Learned  
  Abstract   
 The Digital Twin (DT) term is currently used, sometimes as a buzzword, to refer to a virtual representation or digital replica of a physical object, process, or system. DTs have the potential to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making, in particular if they are not limited to just providing digital shadows of their physical counterparts, but are employed in their full capability to act/react on them via commands and re-configurations, thus enabling an efficient runtime control feedback loop. Even if DTs have already started to demonstrate their suitability for several application fields, e.g., from smart energy to intelligent transportation, our experience in several EU/national research projects has pointed out that some related hard technical challenges have still to be satisfyingly solved. This is particularly true for the effective adoption of DTs in i) industrial deployment environments with stringent latency requirements and ii) very open and wide-scale smart city scenarios. The paper aims to distill the lessons learned about those DT challenges and present our Cloud Continuum DTs concept. More specifically, on the one hand, the paper describes the architectural principles, the model, and the primary design/implementation choices we took in our Cloud Continuum DT support platform. On the other hand, we will focus on the hard technical challenge of ultra-low-latency DTs by presenting our related middleware that is the basis of our Cloud Continuum DT platform when deployed for industrial and automation control execution environments.

 (Re-)Engineering Digital Twins Towards Federation: Vision and Roadmap  
  Abstract   
 Digital twin technology has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modelling, simulating, and managing complex systems virtually across their lifecycle. However, as digitalisation efforts grow exponentially and the endeavours to digitise more objects and assets continue at a rapid pace, more than a single digital twin may be required to give holistic insights and provide multiple decision-making mechanisms in addition to other services. So, it is becoming increasingly necessary to connect and couple various digital twins across different systems/domains so that each can offer a specific service to the whole digital twin. In this paper, we explore the Digital Twins Federation (DTF) concept, which is envisioned as a unified, integrated, interconnected, interoperable, and evolving ecosystem that couples and comprises a group of digital twins. The concept can be utilised in a broad context and targets large-scale systems. The paper discusses the modelling and (re-)engineering of digital twins towards federation. Moreover, examples of architecture and abstract models for the multi-robot warehouse case, entailing the key details of the concept, are provided. Outlining its enabling technologies, current challenges and barriers, the paper suggests a plan and a roadmap for the next steps to realise the vision and enable integration, collaboration, and coordination across an ecosystem of federated digital twins.

 Threats to Instrument Validity Within ‚Äúin Silico‚Äù Research: Software Engineering to the Rescue  
  Abstract   
 ‚ÄúIn Silico‚Äù research drives the world around us, as illustrated by the way our society handles climate change, controls the COVID-19 pandemic and governs economic growth. Unfortunately, the code embedded in the underlying data processing is mostly written by scientists lacking formal training in software engineering. The resulting code is vulnerable, suffering from what is known as threats to instrument validity.   
 This position paper aims to understand and remedy threats to instrument validity in current ‚Äúin silico‚Äù research. To achieve this goal, we specify a research agenda listing how recent software engineering achievements may improve ‚Äúin silico‚Äù research (SE4Silico) and, conversely, how software engineering may strengthen its applicability (Silico4SE).

 Automated Clone Elimination in Python Tests  
  Abstract   
 Code clones are a well-known software quality metric with existing tools for detection and (semi-) automated elimination for common programming languages. While they are usually eliminated by extracting duplicate code into shared methods/functions, we are here looking in particular at Python code for test cases, where clones stem from repeated test cases with primarily different arguments and expected results. In this scenario, the ideal solution is not introducing shared code, but rather using parametrized tests from the unit testing framework.   
 We combine an existing clone detector (NiCad) with our own code transformation that eliminates code clones in Python test cases using the pytest  framework. We show the usefulness of our approach by surveying open source Python projects that can benefit from our refactoring and evaluate the performance and correctness of our transformation by comparing unit-test results before and after.

 Towards Automated Security Hardening Using Timed Path Conditions in Shared Bus Systems  
  Abstract   
 Traditionally, many embedded systems are considered to be safety-critical, as they are used in cars, airplanes, or power plants. As embedded systems are more and more connected to the internet, they are becoming increasingly security-critical as well. At the same time, many applications, including in-vehicle networks, internally use shared bus systems that connect many components with varying security levels. While this provides very efficient means for internal communication, it also comes with the risk that confidential information is leaked to components that communicate over the internet and thus might be the target of malicious attacks, or that such components gain access to safety-critical functionality. In this paper, we present initial ideas on how to use timed path conditions for automatic security hardening with regards to violations of information flow security, i.e. confidentiality or integrity of information, in shared bus systems. We propose to enrich ordinary path conditions, obtained from an information flow analysis, with timing information. Then, we use these conditions to find and automatically correct timing errors that may result in illegal information flow. To illustrate our approach, we conduct this method on an example system where concurrently executed components communicate over a time-shared bus, modeled in the system level description language SystemC.

 Towards a More Sustainable Re-engineering of Heterogeneous Distributed Systems Using Cooperating Run-Time Monitors  
  Abstract   
 We propose an approach to using run-time monitoring for the re-engineering of distributed systems. Our re-engineering method MBRE consists of five steps that provide guidance during a re-engineering. By utilizing run-time monitors that are parametric in a policy, we obtain the flexibility needed for a sustainable integration of monitors. We illustrate this and other features of MBRE at three re-engineering case studies in a hypothetical hospital scenario. A key novelty of our approach is that it supports cooperation between monitors also across technological boundaries. This is of high relevance because, for instance, system components in the IoT often run on different platforms and are implemented in different programming languages. Surprisingly, such scenarios have been outside the focus of the run-time-monitoring community so far.

 X-by-Construction Meets AI  
  Abstract   
 During the past decade, researchers have investigated X-by-Construction  (XbC), encompassing extensions beyond correctness concerns as in the more traditional Correctness-by-Construction (CbC) paradigm. Like CbC, XbC is a refinement approach to engineer systems that by-construction satisfy certain properties (e.g., non-functional  ones in the case of XbC)‚Äîalso, and in particular, in the setting of probabilistic systems and properties, and both at design time and at runtime. In line with the need to integrate concepts from artificial intelligence (AI), this track brings together researchers and practitioners to share their views on the many possible synergies between CbC/XbC and AI.

 Intersymbolic AI  
  Interlinking Symbolic AI and Subsymbolic AI   
 Abstract   
 This perspective piece calls for the study of the new field of Intersymbolic AI  , by which we mean the combination of symbolic AI  , whose building blocks have inherent significance/meaning, with subsymbolic AI  , whose entirety creates significance/effect despite the fact that individual building blocks escape meaning. Canonical kinds of symbolic AI are logic, games and planning. Canonical kinds of subsymbolic AI are (un)supervised machine and reinforcement learning. Intersymbolic AI interlinks the worlds of symbolic AI with its compositional symbolic significance and meaning and of subsymbolic AI with its summative significance or effect to enable culminations of insights from both worlds by going between and across symbolic AI insights with subsymbolic AI techniques that are being helped by symbolic AI principles. For example, Intersymbolic AI may start with symbolic AI to understand a dynamic system, continue with subsymbolic AI to learn its control, and end with symbolic AI to safely use the outcome of the learned subsymbolic AI controller in the dynamic system. The way Intersymbolic AI combines both symbolic and subsymbolic AI to increase the effectiveness of AI compared to either kind of AI alone is likened to the way that the combination of both conscious and subconscious thought increases the effectiveness of human thought compared to either kind of thought alone. Some successful contributions to the Intersymbolic AI paradigm are surveyed here but many more are considered possible by advancing Intersymbolic AI.

 Logic-Based Explainability: Past, Present and Future  
  Abstract   
 In recent years, the impact of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in society has been absolutely remarkable. This impact is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. However, the adoption of AI/ML is also a cause of grave concern. The operation of the most advances AI/ML models is often beyond the grasp of human decision makers. As a result, decisions that impact humans may not be understood and may lack rigorous validation. Explainable AI (XAI) is concerned with providing human decision-makers with understandable explanations for the predictions made by ML models. As a result, XAI is a cornerstone of trustworthy AI. Despite its strategic importance, most work on XAI lacks rigor, and so its use in high-risk or safety-critical domains serves to foster distrust instead of contributing to build much-needed trust. Logic-based XAI has recently emerged as a rigorous alternative to those other non-rigorous methods of XAI. This paper provides a technical survey of logic-based XAI, its origins, the current topics of research, and emerging future topics of research. The paper also highlights the many myths that pervade non-rigorous approaches for XAI.

 Towards Hybrid-AI in Imaging Using VoxLogicA  
  Abstract   
 We present the design of a meta-programming system for hybrid AI, integrating spatial model checking and machine learning. The proposed system architecture blends together different programming languages and execution technologies using a simplified, declarative meta-language. The design features a global-model-checking-alike execution model, backed up by a microservices architecture. The system is meant to be a follow up to the spatial model checker VoxLogicA  currently used for research on declarative medical image analysis, aimed at explainable by construction  artificial intelligence.

 Towards AI-Assisted Correctness-by-Construction Software Development  
  Abstract   
 In recent years, research on artificial intelligence (AI) has made great progress. AI-tools are getting better in simulating human reasoning and behavior every day. In this paper, we discuss the extent to which AI-tools can support Correctness-by-Construction (CbC) engineering. This is an approach of formal methods for developing functionally correct programs incrementally on the basis of a formal specification. Using sound refinement rules, the correctness of the constructed program can already be guaranteed in the development process. We analyze the CbC process regarding steps for potential AI-tool support in the tool CorC, which implements CbC. We classify the findings in five areas of interest. Based on existing work, expert knowledge, and prototypical experiments, we discuss for each of the areas whether and to what extent AI-tools can support CbC software development. We address the risk of AI-tools in formal methods and present our vision of AI-integration in the tool CorC to support developers in constructing programs using CbC engineering.

 Towards Combining the Cognitive Abilities of Large Language Models with the Rigor of Deductive Progam Verification  
  Abstract   
 Recent investigations hint at the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate formal specifications for given program code. In this work, we systematically discuss and categorize different use cases and application scenarios that combine specification synthesis via LLMs with deductive program verification. We present preliminary quantitative experiments on the capabilities of LLMs to generate correct specifications. To this end, we use a prototypical integration of GPT (versions 3.5 and 4o) with the deductive program verifier KeY and the bounded model checker JJBMC. We evaluated our prototype on a set of Java programs that are partially annotated with specifications written in the Java Modeling Language (JML). We show that GPT 4o generates correct annotations in approximately half of all instances across the investigated scenarios. For the case of faulty specifications, we investigate how a feedback loop can help to improve the original answer. Finally, we present a vision of how Large Language Models may support rigorous formal verification of software systems and describe the necessary next steps in this direction.

 Traceability and Accountability by Construction  
  Abstract   
 As artificial intelligence (AI) systems influence ever more high-stake decision-making processes, such as university applicant screening or medical diagnoses, ensuring the trustworthiness of these systems and their decisions is crucial. This paper presents a significant step towards achieving trustworthy AI decisions by introducing a novel framework for enhancing traceability and accountability by construction. Our approach encompasses the entire decision-making pathway‚Äîfrom the raw datasets used to train the AI system, through the algorithms and programs employed, to the involved parties and the final decisions made. At the core of our methodology is the Decision Bill of Materials  (DBOM), which meticulously documents all elements contributing to a decision while ensuring accountability and traceability through cryptographic signatures. Furthermore, we leverage results from logic programming to enable systematic reasoning about the processes and decision documented in a DBOM. This allows us to verify that the system meets specific certification standards and that individual decisions can be qualified as trustworthy. This framework not only advances the construction of reliable AI systems but also aligns technological developments with ethical imperatives and regulatory expectations.

 Synthesis from Infinite-State Generalized Reactivity(1) Specifications  
  Abstract   
 Reactive synthesis is used to automatically generate circuits or programs from temporal logic specifications. In propositional reactive synthesis, generalized reactivity(1) (GR(1)) has proven to be a good compromise between expressiveness and performance.   
 In domains like cyber-physical systems, however, programs must operate on data such as integers or reals, resulting in an infinite state space. This paper shows how to achieve the advantages of GR(1) to infinite-state reactive synthesis. We show how to use an SMT solver to solve the synthesis problem and present techniques to efficiently compute the enforceable predecessor and optimize the fixpoint computation.   
 We show how to generate efficient programs as the result of the synthesis procedure, using techniques that are different from the circuit generation methods used in the propositional domain. We have implemented our method as a prototype to show its efficiency on several existing and new benchmarks.

 On Threat Model Repair  
  Abstract   
 Security by construction is an approach to system development where security considerations are integrated into the design process from the very beginning. Threat modeling helps identify potential threats and vulnerabilities early in the system development process, assess the risk associated with each threat, and design appropriate mitigation actions. In this paper, we study threat model repair, a method to automatically suggest structural changes to the design that mitigate threats discovered by the analysis. This helps find a secure design early in the process by allowing a user to quickly iterate over different design variants.

 Towards Formal Design of FDIR Components with AI  
  Abstract   
 The development of accurate, reliable and effective FDIR (Fault Detection, Identification and Recovery) components is essential in several application domains, to meet the dependability constraints and to accomplish the higher degree of autonomy required in future missions. In this work, we report on an ongoing activity that addresses the formal design, development and validation of FDIR integrating rule-based components with components based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). We show that the integration of symbolic and AI techniques can substantially improve the effectiveness and efficiency of FDIR management functions, while formal tool-supported verification and validation can provide a formal guarantee of the quality of the FDIR systems before they are implemented and deployed. This activity is being carried out within the AIFDIR study, funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) under the ‚ÄúInnovative Space Technologies‚Äù initiative. The AIFDIR methodology will be implemented and demonstrated using TASTE, a tool developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), which follows the MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) approach. TASTE has been recently extended to enable the modeling of HW components and their possible failures, and the verification and validation using automated techniques based on model checking. TASTE will be further extended to allow for modeling and verification of systems including both symbolic and ML/DL-based components, and to support the deployment on the target hardware. A further contribution of the project is the development of a reference architecture for AIFDIR and its demonstration on case studies of interest.

 11th International Symposium On Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation  

 The ISoLA Symposium is a forum for developers, users, and researchers to discuss issues related to the adoption and use of rigorous tools for the specification, analysis, verification, certification, construction, test, and maintenance of systems from the point of view of their different application domains. To bridge the gap between designers and developers of (formal methods based) rigorous tools, and users in engineering and in other disciplines, it fosters and exploits synergetic relationships among scientists, engineers, software developers, decision makers, and other critical thinkers.   
 In particular, by providing a venue for the discussion of common problems, requirements, algorithms, methodologies, and practices, ISoLA aims at supporting researchers in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, flexibility and efficiency of tools for building systems and users in their search of adequate solutions to their problems. Applications and case studies with a conceptual message and experience papers with a clear link to tool construction are all encouraged.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included ‚Äì examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A ‚Äúprimary‚Äù track must be marked, and an optional ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers‚Äô questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù, ‚Äúrevise‚Äù, or ‚Äúreject‚Äù. Authors of papers in the ‚Äúrevise‚Äù decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers‚Äô comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúreject‚Äù, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included ‚Äì examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.

Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers‚Äô questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù, ‚Äúrevise‚Äù, or ‚Äúreject‚Äù. Authors of papers in the ‚Äúrevise‚Äù decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers‚Äô comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúreject‚Äù, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included ‚Äì examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A ‚Äúprimary‚Äù track must be marked, and an optional ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers‚Äô questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù, ‚Äúrevise‚Äù, or ‚Äúreject‚Äù. Authors of papers in the ‚Äúrevise‚Äù decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers‚Äô comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúreject‚Äù, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included ‚Äì examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A ‚Äúprimary‚Äù track must be marked, and an optional ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers‚Äô questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù, ‚Äúrevise‚Äù, or ‚Äúreject‚Äù. Authors of papers in the ‚Äúrevise‚Äù decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers‚Äô comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúreject‚Äù, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included ‚Äì examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A ‚Äúprimary‚Äù track must be marked, and an optional ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers‚Äô questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù, ‚Äúrevise‚Äù, or ‚Äúreject‚Äù. Authors of papers in the ‚Äúrevise‚Äù decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers‚Äô comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúreject‚Äù, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included ‚Äì examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A ‚Äúprimary‚Äù track must be marked, and an optional ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers‚Äô questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù, ‚Äúrevise‚Äù, or ‚Äúreject‚Äù. Authors of papers in the ‚Äúrevise‚Äù decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers‚Äô comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúreject‚Äù, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included ‚Äì examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A ‚Äúprimary‚Äù track must be marked, and an optional ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers‚Äô questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù, ‚Äúrevise‚Äù, or ‚Äúreject‚Äù. Authors of papers in the ‚Äúrevise‚Äù decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers‚Äô comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúreject‚Äù, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included ‚Äì examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A ‚Äúprimary‚Äù track must be marked, and an optional ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers‚Äô questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù, ‚Äúrevise‚Äù, or ‚Äúreject‚Äù. Authors of papers in the ‚Äúrevise‚Äù decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers‚Äô comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúreject‚Äù, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 About IW2025   
 INCOSE's International Workshop is the event of the year for systems engineers to contribute to their industry.   
 Attendees spend 4 focused days working alongside fellow systems engineers who are there to make a difference. Unlike INCOSE's annual International Symposium  and other conferences, there are no paper, panel, or tutorial presentations. Systems Engineers at all levels and from all backgrounds are encouraged to engage in working sessions, and contribute their knowledge and experience to take the discipline forward.  
 Sessions are encouraged to inclusively engage multiple working groups, diverse practitioners, and multiple competency levels as they complete meeting outcomes, satisfying the session‚Äôs purpose. Attendees should experience a different yet complementary experience to regular working group meetings throughout the year.  
 IW2025 Topic Areas  
 Energy Transition  

 Digital Twins  

 MBSE  

 SysML v2  

 Planned sessions will be published on the website as these become available and scheduled via the meeting request tool  .  
 The International Workshop 2025  will be held as a hybrid event allowing for in person and virtual participation, subject to session hosts. Hybrid sessions will strive to include virtual attendees as much as possible, yet individual experiences will vary.  
 IW2025 Attendance  
 IW2025  is open to INCOSE  members, and non-members are encouraged to join INCOSE  prior to the IW. For more information about membership, please visit https://www.incose.org/incose-member-resources/join-incose  or email [email protected]   .

  Call for Bids 
  ISS Conference Series 

  ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS)  
   
 Welcome!  
 We welcome you to the ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces. As an annual conference series starting in 2006, ACM ISS (formerly known as ACM ITS, International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces) is the premier venue for research addressing the design, development and use of new and emerging tabletop, digital surface, interactive spaces and multi-surface technologies. Over the years ISS has been a venue for research and applications of interactive surfaces as well as spaces, which has been acknowledged by the incorporation of 'Space' into our conference identity since 2016.  
 Interactive Surfaces and Spaces increasingly pervade our everyday life, appearing in various sizes, shapes, and application contexts, offering a rich variety of ways to interact.  
 The ISS steering committee members are looking forward to your contribution and participation at the ISS.

 Call for bids: Hosting future ISS Conferences  
   
 We are soliciting expressions of interest for chairing and hosting the ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (formerly ACM Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces) conference in 2025 or 2026.  
 ISS is a successful ACM conference series that consistently attracts up to 200 attendees and high-quality paper submissions. It is celebrating its 19 th  edition in Vancouver, BC, Canada, from October 27-30, 2024 (see https://iss.acm.org/2024/  ).  
 As a first step before submitting a PDF with your bid, you might want to send us a lightweight expression of interest. If you are interested in hosting ISS we just need you to reply with an e-mail that indicates:  
 Main contact person (at least provisionally), and e-mail. 
  Possible geographical location (no need for detail at the moment‚Äîa hotel, city, or region is OK). 
  Which of 2025 or 2026 you are interested in organizing (it's okay to indicate one as a backup). 
  We welcome bids from teams hosting other conferences (i.e., we are open to co-location).  
 After your e-mail we will follow up about further details (e.g., putting together an organizing team), selecting dates, etc.  
  Alternatively, you might also send us the complete bid directly as a PDF document with the content as indicated below.  
 In either case, please get back to us by responding to the ACM ISS steering committee ( steering@iss.acm.org  ).  
   
 Bidding Process for ACM ISS  
 A call for bids for ACM ISS is issued by the SC Chair (typically, in November) and sent to all the members of the ACM ISS Program Committee and the wider ACM ISS community. Bids will continue to be accepted until the venues are decided. We will begin reviewing bids as they are received. As a formal bid, bidders should submit a single PDF document to the SC with the following information:  
 The proposal should address each aspect outlined below (approx. 5-6 pages). A PDF document providing further details on the content of the bid can be found here  .  Based on the merits of the proposals and when the proposals are submitted, the committee will choose the top candidates and then a finalist will be chosen and announced.   
 Location  
 Since ISS is an international forum, we expect that attendees travel from different parts of the world to the conference location. It is important that the proposed location is conveniently located for all attendees to reach by available means of transportation. Learning from experiences during the worldwide pandemic, we appreciate the inclusion of concepts for running hybrid conferences.  
   
 Time  
 ISS conferences have been held at various times during around early / mid November. Your bid should include a proposed time within that range with key dates (e.g., paper submission and notification). The choice of time should also take into account the weather conditions of the proposed location to avoid potential weather-caused travel delays and potential conflicts with other conferences and their submission deadlines (e.g., CHI, CSCW and most importantly UIST).  
   
 Venue  
 ISS officially includes four days with the workshops and tutorials on its first day, which need to be hosted in separate rooms (10-20 people) in parallel. To encourage interaction among the attendees, during the main conference, it is also desirable to have additional space at the venue to put up ISS posters for the attendees to visit during coffee breaks.  
   
 Accommodation & Travel Costs  
 Most attendees will travel by plane and need accommodation during the conference period. One of the responsibilities of the conference hosts/organizers is to locate and reserve a bulk of affordable lodging for attendees. Please describe the proposed accommodation options, including the price range of the hotel rooms and the distance to the main venue and approximate travel costs, at the time of the conference from major centres in Europe, US, Asia/Pacific.  
   
 Provisionary Budget Plan  
 The proposal should also include a provisional budget plan, outlining the cost of major items, including the rental of conference venue, cost/per person for the reception and banquet, and the estimated conference registration fee. Please consider including meals for participants into the budget.  
   
 Hosts/Organizers  
 Conference hosts/organizers should have knowledge of the ISS community (e.g., having attended and published regularly at ISS) and have experience with conference organization. One of the main ISS goals is to bring together people from diverse backgrounds. So ensuring the diversity of the organizing committee is highly encouraged and preferred. Please include short bios of the key hosts/organizers and roles of individuals, including the conference chair(s). Note that ISS uses the PACM HCI journal model of publishing, so Track Chairs are selected separately and are involved in the editorial process across multiple years, though we welcome suggestions.  

 The SC will attempt to balance the location of accepted bids to reflect the interests , diversity and geographical location of the community.  

 Mission Statement  
 The ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS) Steering Committee promotes and maintains the ACM ISS conference as the premiere venue for researchers and practitioners interested in the design, development and use of new and emerging tabletop, digital surface, and multi-surface technologies as well as interactive spaces.  
   
 Contact  
 For any questions or early expressions of interest for hosting a future conference please send an email to the following address:  
 Steering Committee | (steering@iss.acm.org) 

 Structure and People  
   
 The steering committee (SC) consists of six (6) to eight (8) long-time ISS community members who have strong engagement with the ISS community and have been invited to serve on the committee. Members normally serve on the SC for five (5) years. The SC is lead by a Chair, who is elected by the SC. An outgoing Chair may also advise the Chair to help with knowledge transfer. The SC should represent the diversity of the ISS community.

 Tasks and Duties  
 Steering Committee Responsibilities  
 The ISS Steering committee is responsible for:  
 soliciting bids for people interested in organizing a future ISS conference and continuity of the conference, 
  making the decision on where the ISS conference is held every year, 
  providing advice to and communicating with each year's ISS conference chairs, 
  developing the spirit and general direction of ISS and specifically the financial sustainability, the publication model and diversity of the conference. 
  ensuring the highest quality for the program of the conference, 
  promoting the ISS conference series to academia, industry and the public, 
  participating in the 10-year best paper selection process, 
  interfacing to ACM SIGCHI and other HCI sister conferences. 
    
 Steering Committee Duties  
 Members of the SC are expected to attend the annual ACM ISS Steering Committee meeting during the annual conference (in person ideally but via video conference in lieu of this). In addition SC members are expected to take part in the three-monthly video conferences. A member of the SC is expected to be actively involved in the conference series which can include, attending the annual conference, submitting papers, organising workshops, running tutorials, contributing to the SC discussion and decision process and attending SC meetings.  

 Membership  
 How to become an ACM ISS SC member?  
 The SC will invite future members, by choosing among the past general and program chairs of the ISS conference and people involved in ACM ISS over several years. The SC is expected to have less than 8 members and more than 6. People will drop of the SC after a maximum period of 5 years. Membership of a SC member terminates when (s)he is frequently inactive. Along with participation, the SC mailing list serves as an archive of members' activities and should be reported on by the chair of the SC at the start of each annual steering committee meeting.  
 Steering Committee Chair  
 From January of 2018 the term as SC Chair lasts two years. The SC chair is chosen among members of the SC, following a vote.  
   
 SC Decision Process  
 Any SC member can raise an issue by sending an e-mail to the list of all SC members. Every SC member must reply to the mail on the list, describing her/his position within 10 days. If no consensus is apparent, the chair calls for a formal vote (Plurality voting) by email. Every SC member must reply sending her/his vote on the list within a week. A SC member is conflicted with voting for a bid to host a conference, if the SC member is general or program chair of the proposed bid. The member can talk part in the discussion, but it not allowed to vote.  

 Award Process  
 10-year Impact Award Selection Process  
 The program chairs of the current year make the selection of the TOP 3-5 papers of the conference and select the 10-years impact award. One program chair assembles the jury and starts the discussion within the jury. The jury typically consists of:  
 1x PC chair of conference year-1 year 
  2x PC chair of conference year-10 years 
  1x SC member 
  1x ITS "Senior member" of the community

  Call for Contributions 
  The ACM PACMHCI Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS)  track is the premier venue for research on the design, development, and use of new and emerging interactive surface technologies and interactive spaces. ACM ISS welcomes original, high-quality research and industry contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of interactive surfaces, interactive spaces, and novel interface technologies. Beyond our traditional scope ‚Äì i.e., interactive tabletops, large displays, multi-display systems, mobile and mini devices ‚Äì we encourage contributions focused on the use of space and technology around us to bridge the gap between our digital and everyday lives, such as interactive 3D spaces, on-body sensors, interactive art or interactive architecture. We also encourage contributions focused on understanding individual and group needs related to interactive surfaces and interactive spaces, and the impact on individuals and groups of these technologies. We embrace innovations in a wide variety of areas including design, software, hardware, understanding of use, and applications or deployments of such interactive systems. We have two rounds of submissions: February  and July  2024.

  Evaluations of deployed interactive surfaces and/or spaces in specific domains (public spaces, education, science, business, entertainment, health, art, homes, etc.) 
  PUBLICATION MODEL: PACM HCI Journal   
 Full papers are selected using a refereed process  , meeting the ACM‚Äôs highest requirements for rigorous review by the ISS Editorial Board, its associate editors, and peer experts. Papers accepted in any round of submission will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACM HCI), https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci  .  
 Accepted papers are invited to present at the ACM ISS 2024 conference in Vancouver, BC, October 27-30 2024. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. ACM ISS 2024 will be a hybrid event  where both in-person and remote participation is supported.  
 The conference retains its workshop, poster, and demo tracks, which will have their own publication outlet. The call for workshops, posters, and demos will be included in the July round.  
 Submissions will be done through http://new.precisionconference.com   
 PUBLICATION FEES   
 For all accepted papers, regardless of conference attendance, at least one author must register for the ACM ISS 2024 conference in the corresponding author category and pay a registration fee for the work to be published in PACM HCI.  
 SUBMISSIONS   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM‚Äôs new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Submissions to PACM HCI ISS should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. Papers should be written using the template provided by PACM HCI, https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  .  
 Submissions should be anonymized. Primarily, this means that submissions must remove all author and institutional information from the title and header area of the first page. Author information should also be removed from submitted supplementary materials, in particular, videos. Submissions that do not do so may be rejected without review. Furthermore, all references must remain intact. If you previously published a paper and your current submission builds on that work, the complete reference with the author‚Äôs name must appear in the references. Authors must refer to their previous work in the third person (e.g., ‚ÄúWe build on prior work by Smith et al. [X] but generalize their algorithm to new settings.‚Äù) and avoid blank references (e.g., ‚Äú12. REMOVED FOR REVIEWING‚Äù). Further suppression of identity in the body of the paper (for example, in an Acknowledgements section), while encouraged, is left to the authors‚Äô discretion.  
 LENGTH   
 No minimum or maximum length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length when making decisions about acceptance and revisions. Shorter, more focused papers will be reviewed with the expectation of a small, focused contribution. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.  
 We recommend a page length in the new format of between 5-15 pages + any additional pages for references. Typical papers are under 8,500 words.

 ACM authoring templates and detailed instructions on formatting can be found at https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates  .  
 Authors should submit manuscripts for review in a single column format, which is available for Word and LaTeX. Manuscripts should be converted to PDF before submission.  
 Word users  : if the typefaces are not showing up correctly, be sure you have installed the fonts included in the ACM template download. 
  LaTeX authors  : On Overleaf authors can use the provided ACM templates. Authors can use the settings \documentclass[manuscript, review, anonymous]{acmart}  to remove author information and add line numbers for the review process. 
  Please use inclusive language throughout your papers. Some commonly-used charged terminology and alternative suggestions can be found at: https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter  . Please avoid using gendered language, ableist language, and racialized terminology.  
 You are asked to provide alt-text descriptions for all figures in your submission. Writing good descriptive text is important, so please look at http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/describing-figures/  for guidance and examples.  
 REVISIONS   
 PACM HCI ISS will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle of this submission round:  
 Accept  : Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the camera-ready deadline of PACM HCI ISS for verification by the corresponding associate editor. 
  Minor revision  : Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication during this submission round. The revised submission must be submitted at the revision deadline to enter this round‚Äôs second review cycle, along with a brief response to the reviewers‚Äô comments. The revision will be verified by the corresponding associate editor in collaboration with the external reviewers, and if approved, the submission will be promoted to an accepted paper. 
  Major revision  : Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone before acceptance is possible. To allow extra time for such new work, e.g., conducting a new evaluation, they cannot enter the second review cycle of the current submission round anymore but need to be resubmitted and re-reviewed in a future PACM HCI ISS submission round. Resubmissions of revised manuscripts with a ‚Äúmajor revision‚Äù from previous rounds to future rounds will not receive another ‚Äúmajor revision‚Äù and will be either accepted or rejected. 
  To still be considered for presentation at ISS 2024, the revised submission must be submitted in the PACM HCI ISS July round. To the extent possible, resubmissions to the PACM HCI ISS July round will also be assigned the same associate editors and reviewers for re-review. This will not be the case for submissions in later rounds.  
 Authors should submit their revised manuscript to PCS and clearly indicate the submission ID, title, and previous PACM HCI ISS round of the original submission. They also should include an anonymized letter explaining how they addressed the reviewers‚Äô comments and incorporated changes in the revision.  
 Reject  : Submissions that receive this decision will have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions for presentation at ISS 2024. Rejected papers are also not able to submit a revision to PACM HCI ISS July round. However, authors are encouraged to resubmit strongly revised versions of their work to a future round of PACM HCI ISS for presentation at ISS 2025. 
  Desk / Quick Reject  : Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of ISS. The Associate Editors and Papers Chairs may Quick Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will be desk rejected without review. 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE   
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. Authors are encouraged to submit links to preregistrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors are also encouraged to use open access repositories and make their data and other material FAIR when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to describe efforts to make their work more reproducible. Reviewers are encouraged to support evolving approaches to supporting open and transparent research practices. Supplementary material is not considered to be peer reviewed.

 Abstract  
 :  Telepresence robots are becoming popular in social interactions involving health care, elderly assistance, guidance, or office meetings. There are two types of human psychological experiences to consider in robot-mediated interactions: (1) telepresence, in which a user develops a sense of being present near the remote interlocutor, and (2) co-presence, in which a user perceives the other person as being present locally with him or her. This work presents a literature review on developments supporting robotic social interactions, contributing to improving the sense of presence and co-presence via robot mediation. This survey aims to define social presence, co-presence, identify autonomous ‚Äúuser-adaptive systems‚Äù for social robots, and propose a taxonomy for ‚Äúco-presence‚Äù mechanisms. It presents an overview of social robotics systems, applications areas, and technical methods and provides directions for telepresence and co-presence robot design given the actual and future challenges. Finally, we suggest evaluation guidelines for these systems, having as reference face-to-face interaction.

 1. Introduction  
 Telepresence robots are becoming popular in the context of social interactions. Typically, these systems enable people to look at a distant place via teleoperating a robot and interacting with another person at a remote location using the built-in communication devices. Some relevant applications include health care, elderly assistance, autism therapy, guidance, and office meetings [ 1  , 2  , 3  , 4  , 5  , 6  , 7  ].   
 This literature review aims to gather knowledge to help roboticists design improved user- and environment-adaptive systems and technical methods that contribute to enhancing the sense of presence or co-presence via social robot mediation. Reviews have addressed user-adaptive systems [ 2  , 8  ] and environment-adaptive systems [ 9  ] for social robotics (in which the robot is generally an autonomous agent serving the bystander user). However, we further explore telepresence social robotics, with an emphasis placed on the relationship between the robot‚Äôs operator and the bystander user.   
 Within social telepresence robots interactions, two types of human psychological experiences can be considered (see Figure 1  ). The first one involves the remote user  , in which he or she should sense being in the local environment  (i.e., telepresence) [ 10  , 11  ], and the second type involves the local user  , in which ultimately he or she should sense that the remote user is with him or her in the local environment (i.e., co-presence  ) [ 12  , 13  ]. This research will focus on this last type of interaction, or how to enhance the sense of co-presence  via robot mediation. To clarify the role of each agent in the interaction, the following terminology is adopted:   
 Mobile robotic telepresence (MRP) system: remotely controllable mobile platform with video conferencing equipment that allows remote users to navigate within a local environment and socially interact with other persons. These systems can incorporate semi-autonomous functionalities to mitigate operation loads such as navigation aids, points to follow, and obstacle avoidance. 
  Robotic telepresence (RP) system: remotely controllable or semi-autonomous robotic device with video conferencing capabilities that enable social interaction with people in the local environment without locomotion means. Remote users can explicitly control parts of the robot (e.g., the head‚Äôs panning, swinging, tilting, eye gazing, and facial expressions, as well as arm or hand gestures) or enable some semi-autonomous behaviors (e.g., blinking, face tracking, eye saccade, and breathing). 
  Remote user: user that steers the robot from a distant location or simply connects to the robot through a computer interface. 
  Local user: user that shares the physical environment with the robot (bystander). 
  Local environment: environment shared by the local user and robot. 
    
 Presence  is often defined as the sense of being there  in a mediated environment [ 14  , 15  ]. Additionally, Sheridan [ 16  ] differentiates presence (virtual) from telepresence (experiential). Presence  describes the experience of being present within a virtual world, while telepresence  refers to the sense of being in a mediated remote real environment. Co-presence  has been used to refer to the sense of being together  with others in a mediated (either in remote real or virtual) environment [ 13  , 17  , 18  , 19  ].   
 Marvin Minsky introduced the telepresence  concept in the teleoperation context to describe the phenomenon in which a human operator feels physically present at a remote location through interaction with the human‚Äôs sensing systems [ 11  ] (i.e., ‚Äúthrough actions of the user and the corresponding perceptual feedback provided by the teleoperation technology‚Äù) [ 10  ].   
 Paulos and Canny [ 20  ] developed one of the first telepresence robots and referred to it as a personal roving presence (PRoP) device. The goal was to ‚Äúprovide a physical mobile proxy, controllable over the Internet to provide tele-embodiment‚Äù. The system consisted of a simple controllable mobile platform with a video conference set-up (microphone, speaker, and a video camera with 16x zoom and a 30-cm screen on the top of a plastic pole). Additionally, the robot enabled simple gesturing through a two-DoF pointer. They introduced the concept of tele-embodiment  in the robotics context to describe the sensation of embodiment of a human in a real distant location [ 21  ]. Tele-embodiment  was defined as telepresence with a personified perceptible body  [ 22  ]. However, they did not address key conditions such as body ownership [ 23  ] or agency [ 24  ]. Li [ 25  ] surveyed and compared 33 experimental works involving people‚Äôs interactions with virtual agents, telepresence robots, and co-present robots, concluding that robots are more persuasive and positively perceived when they are physically present in the user‚Äôs environment.   
 Short [ 12  ] introduced the concept of social presence  , defining it as the degree of salience of the participants involved in an interaction and their interpersonal relationship. He mentioned that social presence  relied on two concepts: intimacy  and immediacy  . Intimacy  senses the degree of connectedness between the interactants, and immediacy  refers to the psychological sense of togetherness between the communicators. Taking face to face (FtF) as the reference, both concepts are determined by a set of verbal and nonverbal cues such as vocal cues, gestures, facial expressions, and physical appearance. The capability to deliver such cues differs from communication means, so Short considered social presence as the quality of the medium itself  . Later, Biocca [ 13  ] referred to social presence  as the effect on one person‚Äôs behavior caused by the presence of another or caused by knowing that he or she could be observed. Co-presence  , defined as the ‚Äúpsychological connection to and with another person‚Äù [ 17  , 26  ], has been explored in several works [ 27  , 28  , 29  , 30  ].   
 Cognitive robotics aims to provide robots with intelligent behavior through a processing architecture that involves perception, long- and short-term memory, learning, and reasoning. These approaches try to deal with people‚Äôs behavior unpredictability and with real-world complexity. Cognitive technologies are a form of hyper-automation that may combine areas such as symbolic representation, automation, prediction, user-adaptive systems, computer vision (CV), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), or artificial intelligence (AI) [ 2  , 9  , 31  ]. Nevertheless, the use of AI methodologies to emulate or interpret human subjective experiences, such as emotions, should be inspired by neurophysiologic-psychological foundations [ 32  ].   
 An inner issue related to teleoperated telepresence robots is the time delay issue (mainly due to the communication channel and less due to the hardware performance). This can affect synchronicity (rate of message exchange between operator and bystander), compromising the social presence [ 33  ] (e.g., degradations in audio and video streams, control streams, and haptic feedback). Problems regarding latency, bandwidth limitations, and channel corruptions should be mitigated, and while early solutions involved user interface design and control theory-based models (e.g., supervisory control or passivity-based teleoperation), the approaches evolved to predictive displays and control. Advanced solutions for time delay issues are using time series prediction methods to predict the time delay, a robot‚Äôs movements, and user intentions. These new adaptive-based control methods make use of nonlinear statistical models and neural network (NN) or machine learning (ML) techniques (e.g., recurrent neural networks, sequence to sequence, long short-term memory, or generative adversarial networks) [ 31  ].   
 The method for this literature review and article selection consisted of retrieving and collecting review studies on social presence, co-presence, and the principles and heuristics of human‚Äìrobot interaction (HRI), with emphasis on teleoperated telepresence robots. Searches were performed on bibliographic scientific databases, such as ACM‚Äôs digital library, Google Scholar, MIT Press Direct, Elsevier‚Äôs ScienceDirect, IEEE‚Äôs Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, and Springer. Queries included general keywords such as social robots, social robots survey, co-presence taxonomy, copresence or co-presence robots, telepresence robots, adaptive systems, and more specifically, the compositions of these keywords. The selection of papers for in-depth reading was determined by the number of citations, being a recent publication, being a journal (e.g., IEEE transactions, Elsevier‚Äôs, or Springer), being a book, including user evaluations studies, or being an article in a reputable conference in the field (e.g., ACM HRI conferences, IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, ICRA, or the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)). Citations in these papers directed new readings and paper selections. Figure 2  a depicts the article‚Äôs citation distribution per main topic, Figure 2  b is from the Co-Presence Taxonomy/Preditors  topic, Figure 2  c is from the From Telepresence to Co-Presence Design  topic, and Figure 2  d shows the article citation distribution per year.   
 This survey presents an overview of social robotics systems and focuses on how to enhance the sense of co-presence via robot mediation. It reviews the literature to define social presence and co-presence, identifies predictors, and proposes a taxonomy for ‚Äúco-presence‚Äù and ‚Äúuser-adaptive systems‚Äù mechanisms. It provides technical methods to support robotic social interactions. The structure of this article is composed of four parts. Section 2  identifies potential predictors for social presence, suggesting a taxonomy for ‚Äúco-presence‚Äù. Section 3  presents several robotic telepresence systems currently available in the market or used in research. It also reviews autonomous user-adaptive systems for social robots, aiming for a taxonomy, and additionally provides design guidelines for mechanisms that enhance the sense of co-presence in communications through a teleoperated telepresence robot. It includes guidelines for the evaluation of these systems, having as reference the face-to-face interaction. Finally, Section 4  presents the conclusions and future work.   
  
 2. Co-Presence Taxonomy  
 Social presence  has been defined as the sense of being together with another  , which includes primitive reactions to social cues and automatic creation of simulations or mental models of ‚Äúother minds‚Äù  [ 13  ]. Short et al. [ 12  ] defined social presence  as ‚Äúthe degree of salience of the other person in the interaction and the consequent salience of the interpersonal relationship‚Äù.   
 Co-presence  is a different concept, introduced by Goffman [ 26  ] to describe the active state in which a person perceives his or her interlocutor, and the interlocutor also perceives him or her. Copresence  refers to a ‚Äúpsychological connection to and with another person‚Äù, in which ‚Äúinteractants feel they were able to perceive their interaction partner and that their interaction partner actively perceived them‚Äù [ 17  ]. With co-presence being a subjective concept, it involves different dimensions and interpretations depending on the social science discipline and application area (e.g., sociology or psychology) [ 18  , 29  , 30  ].   
 Social presence  appears in the literature as being related to the quality of the communication‚Äôs medium  [ 12  ] and the user‚Äôs perception of the medium. Therefore, preliminary studies have focused on the effect of modality on social presence. They identified potential predictors of social presence by analyzing the technology‚Äôs capability to reproduce social cues (e.g., visual representation, audio, and haptic feedback). The findings were biased by the considered concept definitions. Some predictors contribute directly to presence, co-presence, or social presence, while others affect them indirectly by acting on a person‚Äôs involvement and immersion. Therefore, it is important to distinguish the ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù concept and the ‚Äúpresence‚Äù concept [ 15  , 34  ].   
 Immersion  , also known as sensorimotor immersion  , refers to the extent and fidelity of physical stimulation affecting the human sensory systems and the system‚Äôs responsiveness to the motor inputs. The immersive level depends on the number and range of sensors and the motor channels connected to a remote agent in a real environment (e.g., a robot) or to a mediated virtual environment. Immersion is determined by the naturalness and coherence between actions (head, body, and gesture movements) and the expected sensory feedback [ 35  , 36  , 37  , 38  ].   
 Presence  is the psychological product of technological immersion, defined as the perceptual illusion of non-mediation  [ 39  ] or simply referred to as the sense of being there  in a mediated virtual environment [ 15  , 34  ]. Sheridan [ 16  ] differentiates presence (virtual) from telepresence (experiential), in which presence  describes the experience of being present within a virtual world while telepresence  refers to the sense of being in a mediated remote real environment [ 19  , 40  ].   
 Co-presence  has been used to refer to the sense of being together  with others in a mediated environment, either remote real or virtual [ 18  , 41  ]. As described in the definitions, the use of concepts such as co-presence and social presence should not be confused as they are assessed differently [ 17  ].   
 In the context of social robotics, there are agents with autonomous and semi-autonomous behaviors that are seen by the local person as the ‚Äúother‚Äù. Additionally, some agents simply mediate the communications between two persons (the remote and local users). In the former case, the sense of co-presence is assessed between an artificial system and a person, while in the second scenario, co-presence involves two humans. Typically, in robotic telepresence, the representation of the remote real person is shaped by the technology that mediates communication. This affects the perception of thoughts and emotions when compared with actual face-to-face (FtF) interaction. Such representation of remote humans may be supported through text, images, video, 3D avatars, 3D reconstruction, virtual human agents, computers, and robots. Zhao [ 18  ], Cummings [ 33  ], and Oh, Bailenson, and Welch [ 29  ] reviewed the concepts of social presence and co-presence, and their studies suggest a classification for co-presence predictors. This paper adopts some of these literature predictors, framing them in the context of telepresence social robotics.   
 To unveil a list of technological predictors of social presence, the authors of [ 33  ] performed a literature review of empirical studies and grouped them according to similar manipulations. They performed a bottom-up analysis process and identified the following predictors ( Table 1  ):   
 Initial studies were centered on immersive qualities, but the recent literature also began to address contextual and individual factors, given the subjectivity of the social presence concept [ 29  ]. Nevertheless, studies on technological predictors dominate the literature, enlarging the immersive qualities  class.   
 The categorization of predictors that affect social presence or co-presence, based on related works, point to (1) immersive qualities, (2) contextual and social properties, and (3) individual traits (see Table 2  ).   
 2.1. Immersive Qualities  
 2.1.1. Modality  
 The first studies on social presence analyzed the effect of the modality on the levels of presence achieved, given that the immersion degree varies. These studies on general modality identified technological features with an impact on the social presence (e.g., visual representation, interactivity, depth cues, audio quality, and display). However, medium communication comprises multiple features, and it is a challenge to discriminate the contribution of each affordance. In [ 42  ], the media richness theory  refers to varying the technological qualities of the medium affording distinct levels of social presence. General modality was also identified in [ 43  ] as a predictor of telepresence while analyzing the influence of immersion. Initial studies analyzed the influence of modality on social presence by comparing (1) Face-to-face (FtF) real interactions with computer-mediated communication (CMC), (2) text-based CMC with mediums supporting visual and audio modalities, and (3) immersive virtual environments with non-immersive virtual environments.   
 Face-to-face (FtF) interaction is considered the ground truth for social presence [ 44  ], and several works compare face-to-face (FtF) interaction and CMC, evaluating the capability of these mediated communications to elicit social presence. In general, these studies reveal that the sense of social presence is higher in an FtF interaction when compared with CMC conversation. Cortese et al. [ 45  ] designed a task in which participants had to discuss a news article for 20 min, either with FtF interaction or through computer-mediated communication (CMC) (chat). Communication apprehension was one of the psychological factors to be assessed (i.e., ‚Äúthe level of anxiety or fear associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons‚Äù). They found that the CMC participants experienced a lower level of social presence. Researchers assessing the sociability of a partner and the level of co-location again found higher social presence levels for FtF interaction.   
 In studies involving decision-making scenarios [ 44  ] and in online learning achievement [ 46  ], the results privileged FtF interaction. One study [ 47  ] involving a series of online seminars for 2 months (the same teacher teaching the same contents online and via in-person, FtF interaction) reported no differences in the levels of social presence between both forms of interactions. One justification might be related to the fact that students had enough time to adapt their communication skills to an online learning platform, the evolution of e-learning technologies, and the fact that the students felt more comfortable not moving to a classroom for 2 months. However, this study did not address the characterization of the subjects‚Äô ages in their concluding remarks, which could reveal a tendency.   
 Video and audio modalities guarantee higher degrees of social presence when compared with text-based CMC. However, this difference is not so clear when comparing video-audio modality against audio-only modality. Studies have shown that the introduction of video modality increases the social presence feeling if participants are required to perform visual tasks [ 48  , 49  ]. In studies that compared video-audio vs. audio modalities when involving tasks that do not require visual feedback, such as interview tasks or decision-making tasks, the researchers did not report a significant difference in the social presence [ 50  ].   
 These studies suggest that increasing the quality of an immersive component, such as a video feature, may not be proportional to the social presence felt. There seems to exist a threshold from which further enhancements of a given modality may not produce an additional contribution.   
 Table 3  summarizes the relevant aforementioned and next predictor‚Äôs references, their significant conclusions, and insights on statistics comparisons.   
  
 2.1.2. Visual Representation  
 In communication, the visual representation of interactants is a feature with an impact on social presence. Research has explored to what extent a representation form of the partner can contribute to the sense of social presence. Typically, studies manipulate (1) inclusion or no inclusion of visual representation and (2) the level of realism of the visual representation. The authors of [ 51  ] defined realism  as the extent to which a digital human representation behaves and appears like a real human. The overall concept is referred to as being based on three components: photographic, anthropomorphic, and behavior‚Äôs communicative realism.   
 The photographic component assesses the human-like visual appearance in a representation. Most studies report that the existence of a visual representation of the partner leads to higher social presence levels. In [ 52  ], participants who spoke with their partners through an avatar while shopping in a virtual mall felt a higher social presence in comparison with those who talked without seeing any partner representation. In [ 53  ], in an online support-seeker activity, users reported a higher sense of social presence when a profile picture of the counselor was present, as opposed to to not having a picture. The users also demonstrated a higher willingness to answer questions when the pictures were available.   
 Anthropomorphism contributes to communicative realism because physical attributes such as the mouth, eyes, arms, and legs are involved in speech to generate facial expressions, gestures, and movements. It addresses the level of interpretation of what is not human or personal in terms of human or personal characteristics. Apart from behavioral realism, this manipulation focuses on the degree to which interactants are presented as human-like on the visual and auditory plane. For instance, users would interact via video as opposed to users who would interact via motion capture-controlled cartoons or by means of anthropomorphic agents or avatars vs. animated forms or emoji.   
 Communicative realism addresses the degree to which a digital representation of the partner presents physical and social human-like behavior (e.g., breathing, natural blinking, and posture changes). Behavior realism studies manipulate the presence or absence of nonverbal behavior (e.g., animation) or the degree to which the nonverbal behavior of a virtual human resembles a real human (e.g., with or without eye gazing). The effect of communicative (behavioral) realism is more evident when the behavior of an agent or avatar reflects the awareness of the partner‚Äôs presence (e.g., nodding at the right time, mutual gazing, or blushing). Von der P√ºtten et al. [ 54  ] found that nodding the head of a computer-controlled agent during an interaction contributed to a higher degree of social presence in opposition to no nodding. In another study [ 55  ], the participants of an interaction with a virtual agent reported a higher level of social presence when they saw the agent blushing, a consequence of some mistake during a presentation. Study 1 in [ 50  ] found that the participants felt higher levels of social presence when the partner‚Äôs representation (e.g., avatar) was able to maintain a mutual eye gaze in opposition to the absence of eye gazing. However, Study 2 in [ 50  ] realized that maintaining a mutual eye gaze for too excessive a time for video and avatars decreased social presence (i.e., an unnatural behavior). Bent‚Äôs studies carefully tracked participants‚Äô nonverbal behavior using the head‚Äôs orientation and position sensors, eye gaze trackers, a breath-monitoring chest belt, and data glove-based finger movement trackers. In the avatar‚Äôs mediation condition, the tracked data were used to animate the avatars in real time (head and body movements, eye movements, and hand and finger movements). Their findings showed a similar activity in terms of visual attention and nonverbal activity either in video or in avatar conditions, contributing both positively and quite similarly to eliciting social presence. This suggests that avatars can be used as a tool to assess social presence, with the advantage that they enable behavior cue segmentation. Another interesting fact is that users tend to direct their heads to their partner‚Äôs image but their gazes towards the workspace. A justification for this behavior, even knowing that it is a computer representation of the partners, might be related to the human‚Äôs unconscious social etiquette, that being to keep the face directed to the interaction partner.   
 Studies show that behavioral realism tends to contribute consistently and positively to social presence [ 28  , 30  ], while photographic and anthropomorphic realism presents varying effects (positive [ 56  ], neutral [ 50  , 57  ], or even negative contributions [ 17  ]). The justification for these discrepancies might be related to several facts reported in the literature: (1) photographic realism is not the main contributor to social presence (i.e., the appearance of the visual representation has a secondary role in comparison with cues from social behavior) [ 58  ], (2) manipulations of small features of the visual representation may not be reflected in social presence questionnaires, and (3) the degrees of behavioral realism differ from study to study, making a quantitative comparison with photographic realism vary [ 59  ].   
 In [ 60  , 61  ], the researchers evaluated the effect of visual and behavioral realism on the perceived quality of communication using avatars. They found a positive effect on social presence when there was consistency between both realism components [ 60  ]; that is, although visual representation does not represent a major contribution, the participants felt a greater social presence when the avatar, demonstrating more realistic behaviors (e.g., inferred vs. random eye gaze) which were complemented by a higher level of photographic realism (avatar with a human-like face instead of a dummy face). Bailenson [ 61  ] pointed out the consistency between photographic and behavioral realism as a positive social presence predictor.   
 In [ 62  ], the effect of the 3D avatar type (character-like vs. realistically reconstructed) on users‚Äô trust and co-presence in a mixed reality-based collaborative teleconference was explored. Visual representation based on realistically reconstructed avatars has been shown to elicit the user‚Äôs sense of co-presence.   
 In [ 30  ], virtual humans that demonstrated higher responsiveness to events (behavioral realism) contributed positively to the co-presence in mixed reality environments. Experimental conditions involved remote collaboration, in-person collaboration, and communication interactions via mixed reality, augmented reality, virtual reality, video chat, text apps, and virtual assistants.   
  
 2.1.3. Interactivity  
 The definitions of social telepresence, in the context of robot-mediated interaction, rely on the capability to put forward the robot operator‚Äôs presence to the local person (bystander). Additionally, the extent to which this person is aware that he or she is talking to or interacting with a human being has an impact on social presence [ 15  ] and co-presence [ 63  ]. Studies on this subject try to understand the effect of the interactivity of the agent on social presence. Such interactivity may refer to a computer agent, a person‚Äôs avatar, or a telepresence robot, but the focus of this analysis is on the use of a telepresence robot for conversation mediation. Thus, the level of social presence depends on the fidelity of the medium to support the interactivity that characterizes persons‚Äô conversations. It includes visual and audio cues, nonvisual sensing (i.e., directional sound and haptics like force feedback and touch) and environmental interactivity (e.g., response rate to user input, reciprocity of the interaction capability between the remote user and local user, and clarity of causal relationships between remote user actions and local user reactions).   
  
 2.1.4. Haptic Feedback  
 To improve the sense of reality, it is important to provide some type of physical feedback to the operator or bystander. Useful contributions include providing tactile cues to let the user recognize the surface texture and materials or support kinesthetic feedback to help the user experience the weight of a virtual object. These kinesthetic and tactile sensations enable haptic perception.   
 Haptic feedback is a challenge. However, it may improve the degree of presence considerably. Considerable progress has been made in the field of visual and auditory displays, but haptic feedback is in its early stages, gaining much attention nowadays [ 64  , 65  , 66  ]. Touch contact plays an important role in human interactions. From an early age, babies explore their surroundings with their hands and feel physical contact with parents holding them, and at older ages, handshakes, kisses, and embraces trigger emotions and strengthen relationships. Nevertheless, the physical contact of a robot with a person raises safety issues, and that may justify why haptic feedback is not so prevalent.   
 Touching a robot‚Äôs part (e.g., hand or body) or sensing that component pulling our hand, operated by a remote party, can improve co-presence. Remote hand-shaking has been explored [ 67  ], and examples include the Nao robot hand-shaking the bystander while the robot‚Äôs operator uses a low-cost haptic device (WiiMote) to feel it [ 68  ]. In [ 69  ], a robot hand was attached under a videoconferencing terminal‚Äôs display, and their evaluation demonstrated that mutual touch enhances the feeling of being close. However, the partner‚Äôs action should not appear in the video. Gregory Welch et al. [ 70  ] developed a tactile telepresence system prototype that enables a remote visitor to convey touching patterns on the forehead of an isolated patient through a tablet touch video interface. Regarding human‚Äìrobot first encounters [ 5  ] and greetings, the authors of [ 71  ] used Kendon‚Äôs model [ 72  ] to develop an interaction that included six phases (initiation of approach, distance salutation, head dip, approach, final approach, and close salutation). Human tracked gestures were the inputs for a decision module (based on the hidden Markov model and behavior tree [ 73  ]) that initiated a specific phase at the right moment.   
 Telexistence surrogate anthropomorphic robot (TELESAR) VI can mimic the user‚Äôs movements and gestures from a mechanically unconstrained full-body master cockpit and provide haptic feedback to the operator [ 74  ]. The 10 fingers of the teleoperated robot are equipped with vibration, force, and temperature sensors that can realistically deliver these components of haptic information. Operators can shake the hand of another person through the robot and feel it.   
  
 2.1.5. Depth Cues (Stereoscopy and Motion Parallax)  
 Considering an interaction between two persons through a teleoperated robot, the depth cues become more important for the remote user, since the local user is with the robot, and has natural depth cues. On the other side, if the remote user can perceive the local user in a 3D space, it improves the scene‚Äôs realism and the co-presence. The use of 3D displays or head-mounted displays (HMDs) by the remote user are common approaches to delivery depth cues. However, this requires 3D sensors in the robot‚Äôs side (e.g., stereo cameras and RGBD sensors). Additionally, with the inclusion of an autostereoscopic or 3D display in the robot to present the remote user to the local user, it is possible to enhance the closeness [ 75  , 76  , 77  ].   
  
 2.1.6. Audio Quality  
 As mentioned earlier, audio modalities guarantee higher levels of social presence. The audio channel should provide bidirectional communication between the remote and local users to exchange messages. Recognition of a person‚Äôs voice plays an important role in person identification, contributing to the sense of co-presence [ 78  ]. Voice transmission is expected to be fluid without cuts or delays. Telepresence robots quite often make use of an array of microphones to acquire spatial sound, enabling the remote user to identify the direction of the sound source [ 79  ] or simply detect the movements of the local user.   
  
 2.1.7. Video and Display  
 The sense of being telepresent is also determined by the fidelity and capability of the medium to present the remote environment, including the visualization of persons (face expressions, gestures, postural behaviors, etc.). To this end, there are mediation technology requirements that include visual display parameters (e.g., latency, frame rate, field of view (FOV), point of view (egocentric vs exocentric), image resolution, color quality, and image clarity) and environment presentation consistency across displays [ 80  ]. Display type comparisons reveal a positive effect on co-presence using immersive 3D displays in nonverbal interactions [ 81  ]. For example, the Willow Garage Texai robot rely on the principle ‚Äúreciprocity of vision (if I see you, you must see me)‚Äù, while Excite robot designers defend that ‚ÄúThe visitor‚Äôs [user‚Äôs] environment should be immersive so that the user would have a first-person experience of the destination [remote environment] including full sensory stimulation focusing on immersive vision, audio, and haptics‚Äù [ 3  ].   

 2.2. Contextual and Social Properties  
 Early studies on predictors of social presence focused on immersive qualities; however, the research began to address contextual and individual properties. Given the subjectivity associated to social presence experience, and aside from the physical distance and the medium‚Äôs technological qualities, analyses started to consider a psychological distance between the interactants [ 29  , 82  , 83  ]. These include factors such as Personality/traits of Virtual Human, Agency [ 17  ], Physical Proximity [ 57  , 59  ], Task Type [ 48  , 84  , 85  ], Social Cues [ 27  , 48  , 86  ], or Identity Cues [ 27  ].   
 In [ 30  ], a contextual responsiveness predictor is explored that assesses the capability of a virtual human (VH) to detect and respond to events and cues that happen in the shared space of the VH and the user (e.g., to a broom that falls in the user‚Äôs physical environment or that falls into the virtual VH space). They showed that when the VH detects and directs gazing at the event or orients itself in that direction, the user presents higher levels of co-presence. Studies suggest that users‚Äô perception of the physical space affects their co-presence in mixed reality. Ignoring events in the background, such as objects moving or a person walking [ 87  ], or the inability to shift attention to an external event does not contribute to co-presence. In [ 62  ], the robot that plays a game with the user uses a ‚Äúcheat‚Äù function to trick the user, which affects the user‚Äôs trust, contributing positively to co-presence.   
 In [ 27  ], users reported a higher level of social presence when communicating simultaneously with several remote interlocutors through a telepresence robot than with a single remote person. In [ 27  ], a second study showed that users felt the presence of the remote interlocutor more when the telepresence robot had a low identity than a higher identity (e.g., robot‚Äôs head LCD with or without a face drawing).   
  
 2.3. Individual Traits  
 Gender and age: social studies showed that female subjects tend to experience higher degrees of social presence when compared with males [ 57  , 88  ], but age is not a relevant factor [ 89  ].   
 Attractiveness: in [ 59  ], a human‚Äôs avatar that looks more attractive in a virtual mirror raised the person‚Äôs level of self-confidence in the next encounters with other person‚Äôs avatars and eventually in the real world (distances between avatars are reduced (proxemics)). Such findings provide traits for telepresence and co-presence robot design.   
 Height: in [ 59  ], a human‚Äôs avatar that looked taller than its interlocutor tended to make that person more persuasive in new interactions with others.   
 Psychological traits: a person with a higher immersive tendency showed higher degrees of social presence [ 89  ]. Additionally, people more prone to human social interactions reported higher levels of social presence in experiments involving social robots [ 90  ]. In [ 45  ], persons low in communication apprehension (CA) experienced higher levels of social presence than those high in CA. Less sociable people tended to show lower scores on social presence assessments.

 3. From Telepresence to Co-Presence Design  
 Presently, the market [ 100  ] offers full solutions for mobile robotic telepresence (MRP) systems [ 5  , 6  , 7  , 9  ] (see Table 4  ), and the research presents telepresence robot solutions such as the ones listed in Table 5  . There are also unmovable robotic telepresence (RP) systems, which are listed in Table 6  . These robotic telepresence systems are depicted in Figure 3  and Figure 4  .   
 3.1. Co-Presence Design  
 Mechanisms that contribute to enhancing co-presence in telepresence robots should consider the robot-side systems and the remote user (robot‚Äôs operator) side solutions. Robot-side interfaces support interactions between the robot and the local user (bystander) and between the robot and the remote user (operator). Human‚Äìrobot interfaces can be classified into sight, hearing, touch, and body-sensing technologies. Technological advances include robust robot sensory (vision, face and expression recognition, object recognition, activity identification, pressure, touch, temperature, speech understanding, sound localization, etc.), acting (mobility, proxemics, gestures, gazing, facial expressions, speech synthesis, etc.), reasoning (localization, planning, context awareness, grasping, etc.), and appearance (familiar, unfamiliar, human-like, and mechanical) [ 3  , 122  , 123  ].   
 3.1.1. Sensing  
 Robotic sensing technologies are becoming more efficient, lighter, and cheaper. Early human‚Äìrobot interfaces used to integrate few sensors and relied mainly on video and audio data and low-resolution proximity sensors (e.g., sonars). Current robots can be equipped with 3D or 2D cameras (e.g., low-cost RGB-D cameras), pressure sensors, touch sensors, directional sound sensors (arrays), high-precision proximity sensors (e.g., range laser finder (lidar)), and robot pose and position sensors (e.g., gyroscopes, accelerometers, and GPS). The fusion of these sensors combined with high-accuracy robots, person localization algorithms (e.g., simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or Open Pose), and deep learning approaches, have improved robot operations in an environment, enhancing HRI between operators and bystanders. Valuable information can be extract due to advances in sensor technologies and software, such as sound locations [ 95  , 124  , 125  ], speech segregation [ 126  , 127  ] and recognition [ 128  , 129  ], attention [ 79  ], gesture recognition [ 130  , 131  ], human action analysis [ 132  , 133  ], human intentions [ 134  , 135  ], object recognition [ 136  ], and scene understanding [ 137  , 138  ].   
  
 3.1.2. Action Capabilities  
 Advances in robot software and hardware, lighter and stronger materials, component miniaturization, and lighter and more powerful batteries have broadened robots‚Äô capabilities. Robot mobility has improved significantly, enabling robust navigation in an unstructured environment and in rough terrain [ 139  , 140  ], and they can climb stairs, walk fast, and run, such as the Boston Dynamics ATLAS robot [ 141  ] or Honda ASIMO Robot [ 142  ]. Advances in humanoid mobility and equilibrium are remarkable, including compliant interactions and variable speed [ 143  ]. Having arms, hands, and fingers with more degrees of freedom (DOFs) enabled new types of interactions such as high-fidelity gestures, grasping objects smoothly [ 144  ], or even open doors and pass though them [ 141  , 145  ]. Whole-body expressive movements [ 146  ], facial features to support expression synthesis [ 147  ], and speech synthesis technologies are enabling better HRIs.   
  
 3.1.3. Reasoning  
 Robots are designed to perform several tasks, but task execution is not always perfect (e.g., motion constraints, impaired sensory, control, and communication delays). Thus, advancements in software reasoning processes have been developed to supervise tasks, aiming not for perfect execution but optimum performance. Namely, notable advances have been made in localization and mapping [ 148  , 149  ] and in grasping [ 144  ]. In [ 150  ], the authors explored approaches for a telepresence robot to detect and position itself with a group of people for social interactions (maintaining an egocentric perspective). The inclusion of these autonomous algorithms can help operators and bystanders in their interactions with the robot, simplifying the control, reducing the effort, and improving the intuitiveness.   
  
 3.1.4. Appearance  
 The acceptability of the robots enrolled in a human assistive task also depends on their appearance. Designers have created robots with human-like appearances [ 151  ]. The Geminoid robot has an incredibly realistic head and facial features [ 152  ]. This approach enables more effective communication through facial expressions and natural gestures. Additionally, given the human-like robot morphology, it is simpler to map the human gestures and movements in the robot. The search for realism, however, suggests some warnings regarding Mori‚Äôs ‚Äúuncanny valley‚Äù [ 153  , 154  ]; that is, if a robot or agent is an imperfect replica of a human being, people may feel defrauded in their expectations regarding the affinity as a pair, triggering strange, familiar feelings of unease and revulsion.   
  
 3.1.5. Managing Robot Autonomy in Telepresence System  
 Advances in robot autonomy do not eliminate the role of human operators. Human skills remain crucial in an unstructured environment or when dealing with unpredicted events. The integration of autonomous mechanisms aims for process simplification, and it changes the nature of human‚Äìrobot interaction (HRI). However, there are cases where the complexity increases [ 155  ] (e.g., 2019 Boeing 737 Max autopilot problems with deadly consequences). The availability of automated behaviors for telepresence or in humanoid robots may lead people to use them indiscriminately, diverting attention from the interaction essentials. Nevertheless, autonomous mechanisms aim to reduce users‚Äô mental workload, performing increasingly complex tasks and now being part of our daily lives (e.g., self-driving cars, autonomous vacuum cleaners, and chatbots). The literature refers to methods to integrate autonomy mechanisms in telerobotics [ 156  ], and they can be classified into direct control, supervisory control, shared control, traded control, collaborative control, and cooperative control [ 157  , 158  ].   
 Direct control  : The robot has no autonomy. An operator controls all the robot‚Äôs functions manually. Mirroring is a type of direct control in which the robot replicates the human‚Äôs movements and expressions.   
 Supervisory control  : The robot is programmed intermittently according to the continuous information received from the robot. The human and the robot integrate a closed control loop focused on task performance [ 159  ].   
 Shared control  : The human operator controls the robot continuously. However, those commands may be strictly followed by the robot (similar to direct control) or be modified by the robot‚Äôs system to improve performance or run safely.   
 Collaborative control  : The operator and the robot work together as peers to determine the robot‚Äôs behavior. In Fong‚Äôs work [ 160  ], there is an explicit semantic dialogue between humans and robots to mediate the sharing of control.   
 Traded control  : The human operator starts a behavior or task that is autonomously performed by the robot. At any time, the operator can stop that behavior or task and start a new one.   
 Cooperative control  : The behavior of a single robot results from the controlled cooperation of several operators using any of the aforementioned methodologies.   
 In the shared control method, the operator provides continuous commands to the robot, aiming for high-level behavior from the robot. However, the robot may change those inputs to reach the perceived system goals [ 161  ]. The method assumes that the operator knows how to direct the robot‚Äôs high-level behaviors but may not be sufficiently skilled to express the right commands due to a lack of situation awareness, embodiment, telepresence, or lack of robot motor accuracy and sensor information. Typically, the shared control method includes ‚Äúsafeguard‚Äù mechanisms, in which the operators‚Äô command actions are overwritten if they violate the robot‚Äôs safety rules, such as collision with a wall or person or losing balance [ 162  ]. The software of HPR-1s or HRP-5P humanoid robots was developed to discard commands that could make the robot lose balance, limiting joint angles [ 163  , 164  , 165  ]. In Almeida et al. [ 92  ], given the robot‚Äôs height, the wheel‚Äôs initial acceleration provided by the operator had to be supervised by the robot to avoid its falling down. In Crandall and Goodrich‚Äôs works, the robot‚Äôs desired trajectory was provided through a joystick as the intended general direction and not as low-level position commands [ 166  ].   
 In the traded control method, a task or subtask is performed autonomously by the robot, but it is initiated by the operator and may be stopped at any time. The method is useful for simultaneously controlling multiple robot‚Äôs appendages, such as in teleoperation of humanoids [ 167  , 168  , 169  ]. The Geminoid HI-1 robot [ 169  ] relies on a traded control known as state-based control, in which the operator selects the state from a library of states. It includes five conscious behaviors, namely right looking, left looking, listening, speaking, and being idle. For each state, the robot assumes autonomous behaviors (i.e., motion files), avoiding an explicit operator‚Äôs control of 50 robot actuators. The integration of multiple semi-autonomous mechanisms is essential while controlling the eyes, head, torso, arms, hands, and fingers simultaneously in a humanoid robot. Quite often, operators need to control low-level robot behaviors and additionally focus their attention on high-level tasks, such as (1) robot navigation, (2) obstacle avoidance, (3) triggering robot‚Äôs unconscious and conscious behaviors [ 169  ], (4) object and scene understanding [ 137  , 170  , 171  ], (5) mission planning, or (6) people‚Äòs interaction. Osawa et al. [ 172  ] evaluated the automation of involuntary and voluntary movements using a teleoperated telepresence robot (robovie-mR2). The implemented behavior generation architecture (bi-layered architecture [ 173  ]) enabled the combination of autonomous movements and manual movements controlled by a remote operator. The results showed that bystander users evaluated both the involuntary and voluntary movements positively but also revealed that from the remote operator‚Äôs point of view, the automation of voluntary movements should require additional care (agency issue conflicts).   
  
 3.1.6. Time Delay Mitigation  
 The dynamic nature of the communication medium has an impact on the complexity of teleoperated systems. Time delay, jitter, distance, bandwidth constraints, packet loss, or blackout in internet-based solutions can delay or distort interactions. This can affect the synchronicity (rate of message exchange between operator and bystander), compromising the social presence [ 33  ] (e.g., degradations in audio and video streams, control streams, or haptic feedback). Traditional methods to mitigate time delay in telerobotics involved user interface design and control theory-based models (e.g., supervisory control or passivity-based teleoperation) and evolved into predictive displays and control [ 159  ]. Recent solutions for time delay issues use time series prediction  methods to predict the time delay, robot movements, and user intentions (e.g., user‚Äôs gaze prediction [ 174  ]). These new adaptive-based control methods make use of nonlinear statistical models and neural network (NN) or machine learning (ML) techniques.   
 Ferrell and Sheridan [ 175  ] determined that a time delay affects human operators‚Äô performance while teleoperating manipulators. They realized that the person within the control loop of teleoperated systems under time delays used to adopt a move-and-wait  strategy to accomplish certain tasks. To address this problem, they proposed supervisory control [ 176  ], in which the robot is preprogrammed or programmed online to perform certain subtasks autonomously. By transmitting only high-level commands, there is a data communication reduction, and task time completion improves. Meanwhile, several extensions of supervisory control were developed, including specific languages to chain tasks or predictive displays (i.e., visualization of a phantom robot model that predicts the motion of the real robot) [ 177  , 178  ].   
 Control-based approaches for time delay mitigation in teleoperation systems  can be clustered into two classes [ 31  , 179  ]: (1) predictive control-based methods  (e.g., a discrete linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller for teleoperation acting on the sampling rate or output feedback control of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems) and (2) passivity-based methods  that model the master‚Äìslave operator systems and unsure stability and performance under time delay variability (e.g., a two-port network, hybrid matrix, impedance matrix, constant time delay, scattering approach, wave variable, scaling, and geometric scattering).   
 Time series prediction approaches for time delay mitigation in teleoperation systems  try to compensate for the time delay, observing past intrinsic patterns to predict the future values [ 31  , 156  ]. They integrate trends, seasonality, and white noise and can be clustered into two types: statistical methods  and neural network (NN) or machine learning (ML) methods  :   
 (1) Statistical methods  (e.g., moving average (MA), linear auto-regression (AR), auto-regression + moving average (ARMA), and auto-regression + moving average + nonlinear component (ARIMA) [ 180  ]);   
 (2) NN or AI methods  (e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [ 181  , 182  ], long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) [ 183  , 184  ], sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) [ 185  , 186  ], and generative adversarial networks (GANs) [ 187  , 188  ]).   
 Statistical methods have the advantage of not requiring training with data and are simpler to implement. Although times series prediction traditionally relied on statistical approaches, it has difficulties in modeling the entire set of nonstationary signals. Nevertheless, methods like ARIMA can cope with nonstationary signals. Statistical methods are not appropriate for modeling complex tasks, being more suitable for short-term predictions. Neural networks, on the other hand, have an advantage over statistical approaches in that they enable data description without explicit knowledge of its distribution and can model more complex time series data based on past observations. Neural networks are more prone to adapt their behaviors as the input data increases [ 31  ].   

 3.2. User-Adaptive Systems Taxonomy  
 Social robots aim to assist people, enable telesurveillance of elderly people, guide people on tours, promote physical and mental exercise, keep company, or entertain [ 1  , 5  , 6  ]. In short, they contribute to the user‚Äôs well-being, adapting to people, to the environment, and ultimately to the context. Case studies include interaction of a service robot for 1 week in an elderly care center [ 116  ]. Several types of user-adaptive mechanisms are described in the robotics literature [ 2  , 8  , 9  , 31  , 189  , 190  ].   
 Typically, a framework for a user-adaptive system comprises two components (see Figure 5  ): the interface  layer that is used for the exchange of information between the user and the system (It integrates sensors for the system to perceive the user and actuators to provide stimuli.) and the decision-making module  which, based on perceived information, makes algorithmic decisions and generates response actions to be synthesized by the interface.   
 Robot systems with autonomous and semi-autonomous behaviors can be classified with the following taxonomy [ 8  ]:  
 Autonomous and semi-autonomous | - Adaptive systems with no user model 
 behaviors supported by | - Systems based on static user models 
 - Systems based on dynamic user models 

 Adaptive systems with no user model: systems with reactive behavior regarding the user‚Äôs immediate feedback and with no cache of the user‚Äôs information (see Figure 6  ); 
  Adaptive systems based on static user models: systems that rely on pre-loaded knowledge retrieved from the relevant attributes of the user and used to adjust the system‚Äôs behavior (see Figure 7  ); 
  Adaptive systems based on dynamic user models: similar to the previous example, these systems explicitly maintain user models. They are task-oriented models, updated with users‚Äô information during their interactions (see Figure 8  ). 
    
 User-adaptive systems require information about the user which is typically stored in the form of a user model [ 9  , 191  ]. As reported in an early survey [ 192  ], a new field of research emerged concerning with acquisition, organization, and representation of the system‚Äôs user.   
 Adaptive systems without user  modeling can implicitly map the characteristics of a generic user in the architecture of the decision-making module ( Figure 6  ). Nevertheless, it is a reactive adaptation that shapes the system‚Äôs behavior directly based on the user‚Äôs feedback. The user‚Äôs behavior changes are monitored and trigger an immediate switch to a new system‚Äôs operational state, while no storage or user model update is performed. Table 7  summarizes several works that adopt this type of architecture.   
 Adaptive systems based on static user models  assume that the person‚Äôs profile does not evolve during the interaction. These static models can be built during an initial phase of the interaction ( Figure 7  ), similar to the calibration process, or the user‚Äôs profile can be pre-supplied using external questionnaires. These types of systems are not able to dynamically learn the characteristics of the user. Examples of related works are listed in Table 8  .   
 Adaptive systems based on dynamic user models  perceive, learn, and update the knowledge regarding the context model and the user model. The stored user model is updated during the interaction based on the user‚Äôs reactions. This category of systems is considered the best performing user-adaptive solution, although its implementation is more complex [ 191  , 193  , 194  ]. Table 9  compiles several references for systems based on dynamic user models.   
 Additionally, one of the described categories, such as adaptive systems based on dynamic user models, can coexist in a telepresence teleoperated robot [ 1  , 3  , 172  , 173  ], thus adding adaptiveness functionalities either for the robot‚Äôs operator (remote user) or for the local user that is with the robot. The general architecture of a teleoperation system with user adaptiveness is depicted in Figure 9  .   
 The decision-making modules of the listed user-adaptive systems include different frameworks, such as the Markov decision process (MDP), partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) ( Œ±    POMDP [ 195  ]), Mixed Observability Markov Decision Processes (MOMDP), fuzzy control, rule-based, hidden mode stochastic hybrid system (HMSHS), Bayes-adaptive, dynamic factor graph (DFG), active leaning, or reinforcement learning. Recent approaches for these frameworks are described in [ 196  ].

 Co-presence mechanisms: the availability of robotic autonomous mechanisms enables a robot‚Äôs voluntary or involuntary behaviors that contribute to enhancing co-presence [ 172  ], such as those listed in Table 10  .   
  
 3.3. Evaluation Methods  
 To assess co-presence, telepresence systems require objective and qualitative metrics. Quantitative measures may include physiological signals (such as heart rate, skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin conductance responses (SCRs) [ 229  ], eye scan patterns, electroencephalography (EEG), or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) [ 34  , 230  , 231  ], as well as other metrics that are simpler to obtain, such as accuracy, time to perform a task, and the number of errors or communication delays. However, given the human factor and the psychological components of interaction, questionnaires remain essential tools. There are methodologies for measuring the presence  , social presence  or co-presence  , and flow state  of the users using technological devices [ 19  , 232  , 233  , 234  , 235  ].   
 Flow  is a psychological state that people describe when they are fully engaged in some events to the point of forgetting time, fatigue, and everything else but the activity itself [ 40  , 236  ]. Table 11  lists the available questionnaires to measure the levels of presence, co-presence, immersion, and flow.   
 Usability, testing and accessibility‚ÄìJakob Nielsen, one of the most active proponents of usability processes, referred to the following elements that comprise a definition of usability [ 249  , 250  , 251  ]:   
 Ease of use: the use of products or tasks should be natural and easily performed by the user. 
  Simplicity of learning: tasks and product features must be intuitive and present a logical and consistent sequence to simplify learning. 
  Improved reliability: levels of satisfaction and performance are increased when the action‚Äôs results correspond to the user‚Äôs expectations. 
  Reduction in errors: usability can be increased if designers attribute the errors to the product or task (rather than the user), redesigning it based on the user‚Äôs feedback. 
  Enhanced user satisfaction: the user‚Äôs satisfaction principle must guide all of the design process, making the product or task pleasing to use or perform. 
    
 In [ 252  ], a taxonomy of usability guidelines for the design of telepresence teleoperated robots (interaction effectiveness and efficiency, information presentation, interface visual design, robot surroundings and environment awareness, robot state awareness, and cognitive factors) is proposed. The usability testing process is an effective use of materials and time [ 17  , 249  , 253  , 254  ] that should not be overlooked.   

 4. Conclusions  
 This work presented a survey of recent works, proposing the development of support for social robotic interactions with applications in health care, elderly assistance, guidance, or office meetings. It focused on enhancing social presence via telepresence robot mediation, in which a user should sense his or her remote interlocutor as being locally present with him or her. The research gathered knowledge to help roboticists design improved user- and environment-adaptive systems and technical methods that contribute to enhancing the sense of presence or co-presence. This literature review aimed to define social presence, identify autonomous ‚Äúuser-adaptive systems‚Äù for social robots, and propose a taxonomy for ‚Äúco-presence‚Äù mechanisms. The referred works address robot sensing, perception, action, reasoning, appearance, automation, and cognitive approaches (e.g., statistics models and AI). Additionally, it presents an overview of social robotics systems and application areas and provides directions for telepresence and co-presence robot design, considering the actual and future challenges. Finally, some guidelines for the evaluation of these systems are left, having as reference face-to-face interactions. Based on survey findings in engineering and psychology, our future work includes the design of telepresence and co-presence robots that better emulate or interpret human subjective experiences.

 International Symposium of Robotics Research (ISRR)  
 The ISRR Symposia  have a tradition of convening prominent robotics researchers and pioneers from academia, government, and industry to evaluate and exchange their perspectives and ideas on the current state of robotics and explore promising new directions for future research. Each edition of the symposium is single-track and highly interactive. Attendees actively participate in all sessions to foster stimulating and dynamic discussions. As the flagship symposium of the International Foundation of Robotics Research (IFRR), the 2024 edition of ISRR will continue the tradition of exceptional gatherings and celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the ISRR Symposia.  
 The Symposium will take place in a relaxed atmosphere, with a limited number of attendees to foster close technical and personal interactions. Over the course of three days, approximately 40 papers will be presented. The event will follow a single-track format, and submissions covering all areas of robotics research are welcome. Sessions will be organized thematically, with ample time for discussion. As in previous years, the proceedings of the Symposium will be published as a book in the Springer SPAR series. Attendance is limited, with priority given to authors and invited participants.

 Abstract and Figures  
   
 In recent years we have seen a huge growth of interest in tabletop research and technologies. Apart from the increasing research into underlying hardware technologies and interaction mechanisms, there has also been a significant interest in the dynamics of collaboration that happens ‚Äúon‚Äù and ‚Äúaround‚Äù interactive tabletop surfaces. Most of this work has focussed on collocated interaction, exploring issues such as equity of participation, territoriality, orientation and coordination. This body of work has highlighted several important aspects of tabletop settings, particularly in terms of impact on the dynamics of collaboration. Much less attention, though, has been given to collaborative work practices happening around interactive horizontal surfaces in the presence of other media, technologies and artefacts, and especially in the context of remote collaboration. This chapter presents research and findings of interactive tabletop settings in environments that include various other artefacts and devices. We label these settings with the term ‚Äúassemblies‚Äù to describe and emphasises the real-world character of settings that draws on the concepts of Ubiquitous Computing and Media Space, as well as everyday objects such as pen and paper. We conclude this chapter by highlighting important aspects of distributed assemblies with respect to the boundaries of interactivity and the orientation of these environments.

 Abstract In recent  years  we have  seen  a huge  growth o  f interest  in tabletop  r e-       
 search and  technologies. A part from  the increasing research into    underlying hard-

 dination. This  body of w  ork has highlighted  several  important aspects  of tabletop     
 form factors , particular  ly in terms  of impact on collaboration  dyna m    ics  . Much less      
 attenti on ,  though  ,  has  been  given  to  collaborative  work  practices  ha  p  pening      
 around interactive horizontal surfaces in the  presence of other media, tec h nologies     
 and  artefacts, and  especially  in the  context  of  remote collaboration.  This  chapter   
 present s research an d findings  of interactive tabletop settings in env i ronments that       
 include  various other  artefacts and  devices . We  label  these settings  with  the term     
 ‚Äòassemblies‚Äô  to  describe  and  emphasises th  e real - world  character of  settings  that      
 draws on the concepts  of U   biquitous Computing and Media Space, as well as  ev e-    
 ryday  objects  such  as  pen  and  paper. We  conclude   this  chapt  er  by  hig h lighting       
 important aspects of dis  tributed assemblies with respect to the inte  racti v  ity and the   
 orientation of these env i ronments.      
 Introduction   
 Interactive tabletops  have been u  nder investigation over  a decade. Research  effort    
 has concentrated on appropriate technologies for the tabletop hardware, as well the     
 software  for  interacting  with the  displayed information. In  ad dition  ,  re      search  has   
 been  conducted  to  further  our  understanding  of  collocated  collaboration  at  ta  b-   
 le tops  and  how to  best  support  users in  these  settings.  T he tabletop  i n   terface  has      
 unique characteristics that  differenti  ate it from  others , such  as desktop  co m       puters,   

  2  M√ºller -   Tomfelde and O‚ÄôHara    
 handheld devices  or electronic white  boards. For example,  w ith tabletops ,   the n   o-   
 tion s of ‚Äú    top  ‚Äù or  ‚Äú down  ‚Äù as  observed on traditional vertical desktop computer di s-       
 plays do  not exist in the same ways . T  ogether with  the us e of direct touch and ge s-      
 ture  interaction ,  these  pro  perties have  crucial  consequences  for  the  design  of       
 tabletop interactions  and  technologies . P   la  cing objects  on  the  interactive  tabletop     
 is  anothe  r  example  where new  avenues  for    tangible  interaction  research  are    
 op ened  .  T raditional  application  s  with a graphical  user interface d e signed      for   use     
 with mouse  and  keyboard need  to  be  refined    when interaction  is  by  direct  touch    
 input  devices. Similarly,  the  ability  to rotate  objects such  as  application windows   
 or digital  documents , imita  ting som  e  of the    handling of  paper documents  has b e-    
 come another  important issue. Another  uniqu  e ness of  the tabletop  interface  is the        
 computer display  and interaction  space no  longer be  long   to    an individual.  Due to   
 its  size  and ho  rizontal layo  ut ,  the  interface  is co n   sidered  semi - public  rather than       
 private. Furthermore  ,  the tabletop  interface is    highly suitable  for small  group co l-    
 laboration, whether seated or  standing around tabletops.       
   
 As well as offi  ce based applica  tions, e ntertainment  and  domestic applica  tion s  have      
 em erged , as well  as the use  in public spaces such  as cafes and museums. The  most        
 valuable body of r e search on tabletop settings   has focussed  on the tabletop display   
 and how  to interact  with it. However,  more work is necessary to  build on the  r   e-   
 search that has sought to understand  the role o  f tabletops in the real world appl ic  a-        
 tion scenarios . With this in mind,  t oday‚Äôs real world collaboration s  neither co n sist         
 of  solely  using  tabletop  s  for  interaction    nor  are  they  limited  to  only  co -  located    
 joint  activities.  Laptops,  netbooks,  and  mobile  phones  amongst  other s  have  b e-       
 come incre  asingly  used  for collaboration  while applications  may    run in  a comp u-      
 t ing  cloud  or  data  centres.  Collaboration  across  multiple  sites  beyond  trad i  tional    
 phone and  video conferences  has also  becomes more  important when  it comes  to    
 team work using groupw are  applications   on high - speed  networks . The  se  scenarios         
 may  involve  the  use  of  video  mediated  communication  with  sh  ared  interactive     
 workspaces.  In  addition,  t oday‚Äôs  hybrid  work  environments  consist  of  dig i tal        
 workspaces as  well  as real  spaces  w ith  users  fluidly  select  ing       and switch ing   b  e-    
 tween  them effortle  ssly as they  carry out  their work .  An  intera  ctive tabletop also        
 combines  aspects  of real an  d digital  workspaces.  The  table  is    a  physical  su r face       
 around which a small team can  work together, while the horizontal inte  ractive di s-     
 play  provides  team  members  access  to  any  digit  al  information,  documents,  and     
 appl i  cations.    
 In  the following  discussion, we  will provide  a  brief  background of  the role  of    
 tabletops  in  combination  with  ot  her  information and  communication  art e facts     ‚Äì

 Horizontal Interactiv  e Surfaces in Distri buted Assemblies   3      
 Background   
 Consider office  workers  in  typical  everyday  settings:  besides  having  their  own     
 standard desktop computer, they utilise  a variety of other device s  and art e facts that        
 constitute  an d contribute  to  the ir  work  envi  ronment. These  devices  and artefacts      
 are  either directly  or indirectly  related  to the  desktop  computer, such  as  attached   
 portable digital storage   units  ,  mobile phones  or a collection  of data  CD - ROMs on      
 the shelves. Eve  n more traditional media e  xist and are still used in to   day‚Äôs offices ,      
 such  as  books,  journals ,  pen  s  and  paper document  s .  W hite  boards  and  pin -  up          
 boards, are  still useful to    quickly support discussions  in face - to face  mee t  ings, jot      
 down  note s ,  or  to  sketch      out idea s   .  Often,  interactions   with  a p plications  on  the       
 desktop  computer  or laptop  are  complemented  by  using  paper  and  pen ,  e.g.,  for       
 note  taking  and  sketching.  During  a    presentation  of  ele c tronic  slides  to  a  small      
 group , a trad i tional flip chart might be used  to capture topics, or discuss side idea s .         
 In  other words,  nowadays w  ork environments  still draw  on  tr a ditional media  and     
 technologies  for everyday work  pract  ice s. Wh  at  holds true for   today‚Äôs    work  env i-      
 ronment s  for  individuals may  not  be  any different  to    collabo r   ation  environments      
 in the domestic domains or whe  n small groups gather around  interactive tabl e  tops  .    
 Tabletops in scenarios of Ubiquitous Computing   
 Integrating  tabletop  settings  into  everyday  environments,  whether in  the  work     
 place, public  spaces, or  domestic  environment, re  lates  to scenarios   described  and    
 envisioned by M  ark Weiser in the early  1990s [1]  . He  intr o   duced the paradigm of    
 Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) in which compu  ting was embedded  into ever y-     
 day objects  and environments .  Tabletop computing fits  neatly within these  env i-       
 sioned scenarios of Weiser.  What is important here though is th  e need to consider    
 the tabletop in  the context of the broader  ecology of interactive devices a  nd ever y-    
 day objects that comprise the everyday scenarios of the U bi  comp    vision  .. Early r e-      
 search works have explored  how interactive tabletops can be integrated  into an o f-     
 fice environment with other enhanced room elements [2   , 3] or with a set of laptops      
 [4] . Research  conti nues into recent times using hand held devices (e.g.   [  5] ) or m o-     
 bile phones  (e.g. [  6  , 7]).  Further  research is  necessary to  articul ate other  aspects       
 of artefact assemblies with respect to t  abletop computing.    
 Tabletops in  Media Spaces   
 Although an interactive tablet  op is well suited for the work of a small coll o ca t-      
 ed group,  tabletop  s  can  also be considered  for distributed collaboration sce n    arios.   

  4  M√ºller -   Tomfelde and O‚ÄôHara    
 When accepting slightl  y tilted interactive  display to be  cla  ssified as tabl e tops, the     
 ClearBoard System from 1992  by Ishii and  Kobayashi [8]  can be  r e garded as one        
 of  the  most  important  landmark  research  publications.  The  Clea r Board  can  be     
 considered  as  one  of  the  first  examples of  a d  istributed collaboration  using  ta b-    
 letops. Interaction on  shared displays was accompanied b  y video link b e  tw  een two    
 sites to provide eye contact amongst co l laborators.      
 In the  same year, the  Hydra desktop  video conferencing system  was presented   
 by Sellen et  al. [9]  . T  heir work e x   plored  the possibility of maintaining  the correct    
 spatial configuration  of the co n ference p  artners. The Hydra  system was combined     
 with  the Active  Desk  [ 10 ]   ,  also  a  slightly  tilted in  teractive  display,  to  showcase     
 the  use  in  video  conferencing  application  with  shared  appl i cations.  In  the  late      
 1990s the  Agora system  [  11  ] was  developed to study  mediat  ed remote  collab  o r a-       
 tion around  a shared desktop.  The system was  designed to allow  up to four pa r  ti c-     
 ipants  to  coll aborate by  monitoring  each  others‚Äô activity  naturally. Sim  i   larly, the   
 goal of  the t - Room  project [    12  ]  was to   al  low     users in multiple   t- Rooms feel as  if     
 they were  in the same room.  In the c  entre of the t- Room    was a  worktable that was     
 monitored with  a video  camera and  replicated in  the display  on the  wor k table at     
 the remo  te sides. Recent  studie  s have  investigated implications  for the  di s  tributed     
 collaboration  ‚Äúaround‚Äù shared  workspaces  on  interactive  tabletops (see  e .g.,  [ 13   ,    
 14 ]) ,  while  some  of  these  works  are  in  the  tradition  of  the  ClearBoard  system,     
 where a  video link was  integrate  d, others  rely on audio  communicat  ion only  (see    
 also previous cha p ter in this book).      
 Distributed assemblies    
 The focus  of  this chapter  i  s  to  discuss  tabletops  in  the  presence  of  other  media,       
 technologies, devices, an  d artefacts. We use th e    term assembly   to  ref  er to an env   i-   
 ronment  or space  for  interaction and collaboration  consist ing   of  mult i  ple devices      
 and artefact s  with a wide range  of different properties. Devices and art e facts ma  y       
 be large interactive displays, standard desktop computers, laptops, ne t  books, smart   
 and  mobile phones  and  also  includes other  tec h  nologies such  as  audio  and  video   
 communication  technologies .  Further  possibl  e  elements  of  a s semblies  are  white       
 boards,  flipchart  s,  books, fol d ers,  paper and  pen,  as well  as  other room  elements      
 s uch as tables,  chairs   etc  . This definition of assemblies strives to comprise not o n-      
 ly  scenarios  of  Ubiqu i    tous Compu  ting and of  Media  Spaces,  but   eventually also     
 those of  T angible User I nte r   faces,  Mu     lti -   Display  E nvironments  (MDE) , as in  [   15  ,      
 16 ]  and Roomware   [3]  ,  amongst  others. Not  only does  t he term  attempts   to in  t e-         
 grate the  above  listed device s ,  scenarios an  d ap   proaches,  but it  also  to   highlights     
 the heterogenic  and hybrid character of everyday  interaction and collaboration e n-     
 vironments. The  concept of distributed  assemblies  then refers  to scenarios  of di s-      
 tributed collaboration  where one o  r more remote  spaces for m a s semblies for  users      
 to work with.

 Studies in distributed assemblies   
 I n this chapter, we  also  offer reflections on issues   arising  from tabletops  in distr i b-        
 uted  asse m  blies.  In   particular  ,  we  explore  the  relationship   between  interactivity     
 and  non - interactivity    ,   and  the  implications  of  video  mediated  communication in      
 distributed settings  using tabletops . These are presented through a number of  stu    d-   
 ies . We first look  at a field study of an interactive table deploye d  in    the public set-       
 ting o f a caf√© bar . The notions of interactivity a  nd non - interactivity are raised. R e-            
 lated to these notions,  we then present a second study which offers a n    examination     
 of the  role of  a  table  rim  in managing  artefact  assemblies  in coll o  cated      use. Fo l-      
 lowing  this  we  report  on  a  field study  of  distributed  meetings in  an office  env    i-   
 ronment  in which  an interactive  horizontal surfa  ce is  used to  interact with  shared   
 vertical  d isplays.  Finally ,  we  report    observations  from  a more  formal  investig a-    
 tion into tabletops  in distributed collaboration. These stu  dies hig h  light and emph a-    
 sise  the  boundaries  of  interacti v ity  as  well  as  the  influence  of video  mediated       
 communication  on  the  perceived  orientation  of  the  s  etting  in  di s tributed  asse m-      
 blies.    
 Collocated tabletop interaction   
 The focus  of the  majority  of the  tabletop research   is  on the  interactive   hor i zontal        
 display area  and on  understanding  how best  to support  interaction and  collabo r a-     
 tion at  tabletops. Research  has been  conducted to  gauge the p  hysical reach at  t a b-     
 letops  in  terms  of  ergonomics  [ 17 ]   ,  and  the  use  and  organization  of  the  space     
 around tabletops  during collaboration  [   18 ]   . These  concepts need  careful  examina-      
 tion when  designing  tabl  etop  interfaces for  successful  deploy me  nt in  real - world             
 settings. Little attention  so far has  been paid to  the fact that m  ost hor i zontal inte r-      
 active displays still require   a physical support base or  frame around the di s play a r-      
 ea,  which we  refer to  as  the rim  around  the tabletop.  The rim  usually  frames the   
 entire  interactive  display  area,  and  we  can  assume  that  the  rim  can  be  reached     
 without much effort and  used  very ea s ily.  Therefore, it  is very  likely that th  e rim,     
 though non - interactive, can serve specific  needs of users, for example, to phys i ca   l-     
 ly  lean upon,   to  rest arms  ,  or     to  place  and work  with artefacts such  as  paper .    Of    
 additional interest is the rim exists  in the area that   can be  characterised as the indi-     
 vidual‚Äôs ‚Äòpersonal space‚Äô  [    18 ] used exclusively  by a single  user when considering      
 group  collaboration at  tabletops. Upon  realising the  concept  of pe r sonal  space  in     
 digital  tabletop  settings,  it  i  s  apparent this    personal  s  pace  i n cludes    both  a  non -    
 interactive area on the rim and an in  teractive area on the hor i  zontal display.     
 Unsurprisingly,  tabletop  research has so far focused  exclusively on issues of i n-        
 teractivity  with  tabletops,  from  different  sensing an  d  mecha  nisms to  applic a   tion         
 design and  social  studies of  tabletop  us ag   es  (e.g.  see [    19  ,   20  ,  21 ])   .  L ittle  e x    plicit    

  6  M√ºller -   Tomfelde and O‚ÄôHara    
 attention  has  been  given  to  understand the  role  of  non - interactiv    e  areas on  ta b-      
 le tops  and the  relationship  between interactivity  and  non -   interactivity  .  Acti  ons in      
 the interactive a  rea may constrain action  in the non -  interactive a  rea and vice versa   
 and this could impact and shape the ways interactivity i s managed.     
 In this subsection  , w  e offer reflections on the relationship between interactivity        
 and  non - interactivity  in  the  context  of  artefact  assemblies   in  tabletop  se t  tings.     
 These are presented through a number of studies . T he first   is a field study of a n in-      
 teractive  table  deployed in  a  caf√©  bar , while   th  e second  is  a m  ore formal  exper  i-   
 ment that explicitly look s  at the role of a table rim in managing artefact asse m blies       
 in tabletop use.      
 Caf√© - bar      
 The  relationship   between inte  ractivity an  d non -  in  teractivity is  both d y  namic  and     
 co mplex. At  times it  is clearly delineated  through design  (e.g. a  rim around  a t   a-   
 ble) while  at other  times the relationship  is fluid -  something negotiated  by a c tors         
 in  the accomplishm  ent of  social  action. As  Crabtree  argues,  this  accomplis h ment     
 and organisation  of social  action relies up  on the spatial  and material  a r rangement     
 of artefacts [  22 ]   . In any  setting and with any tech  nology, these arrangements co  m-     
 prise  both  interactive  and  non -i  nteractive elements  and the  re  l a   tionship  between     
 them. In any  particular engagement with an  interactive table people will m  ove fl u-    
 idly betwe  en interacti ve  and non -i  nteractive    intentions  or  ac  tions  with a co  ntinual   
 negotiation o f the regions and  boundaries where interacti v ity and  non -  interactivity      
 should occur. In this respect  we can draw some para l lels with  Palen and Dourish‚Äôs      
 [ 23  ]  discussion  of   how  people  continuously  negotiate  boundarie s  of  public  and      
 private dissemination and the work of Bellotti et al [   24  ] in  their discussion of sen s-       
 ing  systems  where  inher  ent  am  biguities  exist  betwe  en  inten  tional  an  d  non -    
 intentional  interactions  and  where  the re  is  a  need  to  contin u ously  negotiate  the      
 boundaries between them.    
 Th e  field  study involved  the  deployment  of  an  interactive table  in  a  caf√© - bar.       
 The interactive table was situated in a room in the bar with a large sofa and woo d-    
 en bench arranged for sitti ng  around  th  e table (see figure 1a).  The rest of the room     
 consisted of several small coffee tables each with  3 - 4 chairs a r ranged around them       
 (see  figure  1b).  The  interactive  table  consisted  of  a  PC  and  a  horizo n   tal  touch     
 screen display  housed in  a low  coff ee -   table format   style casing. The  touch screen    
 display was a 40 - inch plasma with a screen resolution of 12  80x768. A wooden rim     
 of a p  proximately  11 cm surrounded  the screen on  all sides. The touch  screen was   
 single touch  only. The content  on the display  consisted of hom  e page with  grap h-    
 ical links  to a range  of short films,  interactive installations  and games from  dShed     
 ( www.dshed.net  ) the Watershed‚Äôs online showcase of creative digital m  edia.     
 To set the context for discussi  on of interactivity and non - interactivity, we b e gin       
 an  analysis of  the  relationship  between  people a  nd standard  table  surfaces  in  the    
 room w  ithout interactive  consequence s . The  spatial properties  of the  tables are  of     

 Horizontal Interactiv  e Surfaces in Distri buted Assemblies   7      
 signif i cance  here  because  they  essentially  position  people  at  particular  p hysical      
 distances from each other and in particular postures wit  h respect to other social a c-    
 tors  on  the table.  Physical  distance,  being  related  to zon  es of  social  distance  has   
 bearing s on th  e way  the table  surfaces are used  and touched  under different soci al       
 circumstances. We  illustrate  this by examining  an  episode where two young wo m-       
 en were having a  meeting at one of the coffee tables  depicted in Figure 1b . On the     
 table  they  had  separate  paper  document s  for  dis  cussion arranged  on  the  table        
 among  their drin ks.  At different  points during  the  conversation the  girls e n  gaged    
 with and touched the surface in  differen  t ways. One  of the girls rested her elbows   
 as she leant over the document on the table to read it. The  other girl then leant into   
 the table with  her a rms touching the surface as  a way of signalling  her interest and      
 at tention. Through  the conversation they leant in  and out of the table in a  carefully    
 choreographed manner. W here    and how the  surface was touched  during the o  ng o-     
 ing  course  of  these  e ncounters are  intimately  bound  by   the  unfol d  ing  action  ,  in -      
 the - moment social  action  the  relationship  with  the material a r rangements  of  arte-        
 fact s  on  the  table and  the  relationship  with  table  itself. The  sp a tial properties  of      
 where and  how the  surface  was  to uched  were  someth  ing continuously negotiated   
 by all  parties. It was  highly contingent  and something done  u n  knowingly without   
 awareness. It  was done  with great social  significance but i m portantly,  as we shall     
 discuss  later,  without  interactive  consequence.  In  other  conversations  we  o  b-   
 served,  there was  similarly  choreographed use  and  touch  of the  table su  rface but   
 with  differ  ent  spatial   properties reflecting  the different  social relationships,  arte-    
 fact configuration  and  unfolding conversational  trajecto r ies  o f  the pa   r tic  ular epi-       
 sodes.    
 The significance of  this dynamic  use and touch of  the non - interactive  surfaces       
 becomes apparent when we  place these issues within the context of  the interactive   
 table  where interactive  and  non -  interactive intentions  in  relation to  the horizo  ntal   
 surface come together . Let us consider an episode where the  non -  interactive inte n-       
 tions a  nd actions  impacted on  subsequent  interactive opportunities  with the  table.   
 In this episode  a woman arrived at the inte  ractive table. She was struggli  ng to ca r-      
 ry a large handbag, several packets of crisps and  peanuts and a g lass of red wine in

 both hands.  She dumped them  all down together  on the glass  surface of the  inte r-    
 active  table, without  initial  concern for  the  arrangement  of the  objects.  With  her   
 hands free  she was  able to then  arrange things  properly on the  interactive surface     
 as she settled down.    
 In this episode,  as the wom a n arrived at  the table, its primary function was as a     
 physical  surface onto  which an  awkward - to  - carry  group  of  objects  needed  to be     
 rested. At this point in her encounter, the intera  ctive properties of the table were of     
 secondary  concern. In  performing this  activity, though,  the n  on - interactive plac e-      
 ment of  objects then  rendered the  inter  active properties  of the  table   inacc  essible.   
 This was not simply through obscuring the information on the table bu t rather th  at    
 this  particular  touch  screen  technology  did  not gracef  ully deal  with touch  dete c-    
 tion in the co  ntext of other objects on  the table. By doing these  non -  interactive a c-    
 tions  at the  beginning of  her  encounter with  the table,  further  uses of  the intera c-    
 tive properties were blocked.    
 What is apparent in this episode is the multi - faceted nature of the  table surface     
 and  actor  intentions  within  the  context  of  the  caf√©  environment.  We  have  hig h-    
 lighted  here  the  behaviour  on  arrival  but  of  further  significa nce  here is  how  en-    
 counters  such as  these unfold  over  time during  the visit  [ 25 ]   . F  or example,  other     
 people arrived to join the woman at the table later on in the encounter and they too   
 placed  drinks and  objects  on the surface  that  inhibited  interactive  use.  Similarly,     
 bar staff brought  plates of food  to the table and  placed them down on  the surface.   
 During a typical caf√© ep i sode, then,  the points at which  there was a  clash between     
 non - interactive  intentions and  i nt  eractive potential  were many.  More importantly,      
 these  points  involved  other  parties.  Any m  anagement  of the  boundaries b  etween   
 non - interactive and  interactive use  was then something  to be dea  lt with collabo r a-       
 tively within the context o  f other well - established social and behaviou ral sch e mata        
 for caf√© episodes.    
 In managing  the boundaries  between interactive and  non - interactive intentions,     
 we  obser  ved a  number  of notable behaviours.  In the  first instance, we  saw  some   
 placement of  bottles and  glasses on the  rim of  the table  in order to  allow intera c-    
 tion with  the content on the  display. Important to  th  is strategy is the  clear deline a-    
 tion  in  the  design  of  interactive  and  non -i  nteractive  properties  of  the  table -    the   
 wooden rim  being  unders  tandably non - interactive  i n  these  instances and  thus  a f-       
 fording placem  ent of objects  in the  context of  interactive intent.  For some  pe o ple     
 though,  the  rim was  too  narrow  and rais  ed, leading  to  concerns  about p  recarious   
 placement of drinks at the edge of the table  and the potential to spill onto the table   
 and  damage  the technology.  For  these  people, while  there  was  clear delineation,   
 the particular dimensions of the de  sign created hindrances to such a strategy.    
 Exploratory rim study    
 A rim around an interact  ive display can be found in  various settings and in di f-     
 ferent combinations  of display technologies  and interaction devices. Lets  consider

 first  research  tabletop  systems  that  showcase  possible  patterns  of  use of  the rim    
 and  commercial  tabletop  systems  t o  investigate  how  the  rim  is  confi g  ured  and    
 used. T he UbiTable [    26 ] , for example,  is based on a collaboration scenario  that i      n-   
 cludes  personal  laptops in  an  ad - hoc  mee t ing  around  a  coffee  table    - like  surf   ace.   
 The multi - touch device [ 27  ]  rests on a real table and comes with an approximately         
 5cm rim  elevated several  centimetres from the  real table.  Possibly due  to reasons   
 of stability ,  laptops are placed  on the  rim an   d partially  occlude the personal inte r-    
 active display area, while the public display  space in the centre remains visible  for       
 both collaborators.  In recent  research about the  equity of  intera c tion participatio  n     
 [ 28 ]   ,  the same  multi - touch  device  in  a similar  setting  is  used. The  physical  table      
 under the  touch device serves as  an area to  lean on, place  sheets of paper  and op-   
 erate with co m puter mice.      
 For the ta  bletop s used   in  the Augm  ented Surface  system  [4] no  expli cit rim  is        
 realised  since  the  whole  surface  of a  table is  used  for  top - down  data  projection.     
 However, the  laptops in  the  coll  aboration scenario  are placed  on the  edge of  the   
 physical  table  within  reach  of  the  users leaving  a  central  space  on  the  table  for     
 group usage . In other res  earch work, the rim is exp  licitly introduced to support the    
 comfortable use of  m ice   and for  leaning  on the  t a  ble while standing   around  it [ 29  ,       
 30 ].    
 Most  commercially  availa  ble  systems  us ing   display  technology  such  as  rear     
 pr o jection and L  iquid Crystal Displays (LC  D) come with a  rim around the display     
 [ 31  ,  32 ]   .  The predom  inant design  of each  of the  three tabletop  systems we  exa m-     
 ined  comprises  a  non -   interactive  rim  around  the  interactive  display  area  that  is   
 smaller at the  long sid e of the  display than at the short  side. This holds for the d  e-    
 sign of  table systems  with a  4:3, as  well as  with a 16:9  screen ratio.  The analysis   
 of technical specifications  reveals the rim at the long side  of the table systems v a r-      
 ies from  11 , 18 and  to 28cm,  respectively. The short  side of the  table has  a rim of    
 18, 25 and 55cm.  We con  sidered als  o two other table  top systems th  at come with a    
 uniformly  s  ized  rim :  the  DiamondTouch  DT107  [    33  ]  and  t   he  r e acTable*  [    34 ]   .     
 With this is mind, one can assume this is a  frame for physical  support of the tec     h-    
 nology rather  than a  rim  designed  deliberate ly for users  (see Figure  2). While the      
 small  tabletop  sy s tems [ 31  ,  32  ] are  designed  for  sitting around,  the  InteracTable         
 [ 35  ] with its larger  rim is d e signed for small groups standing around the table [3].

 To further  understanding of how  the rim around  a digital  tab letop is  used with       
 an  assembly of  artefacts ,  we  conducted  an  exploratory  study collec  ting quantit  a-   
 tive  and qualitative  data  through questionnaires,  objective  measures  and observ a-    
 tions. We configu  red a 46 -  inch diagonal LCD  display (ratio 16:9) as a  multi -  to  uch    
 tabletop. The h  eight of the tabletop wa  s 73.5cm, chosen to a  ccommodate comfort-   
 ably seated positions around it. The table had a non - interactive  rim of 25cm on the     
 long  side, and  31cm  on the  short  side, of  the  interactive display (see  fourth  table     
 shape from the left  in Figure 2) . This desig  n was guided by th  ose of commercially     
 available tabletop  systems and  by the  form factors  of a  standard la p top  (footprint     
 of  33cm  by 23cm),  a  wireless  keyboard (44cm  by 16cm)  and  the  A4 paper  size   
 (21cm by  29.7cm). We d ecided  to have one  side of the rim  slightly thinner  than  a        
 standard  laptop‚Äôs width  and  the other   side   shorter  than  the  height of  an  A4 page.     
 The aim  was to elicit  partici  pant preferences regarding  the placement of  items on   
 either interactive or non - interactive a r    eas.     
 A group of three participants worked colla  boratively on the interact  ive tabletop   
 sorting  task  with 18  magazine  covers  (electronic  copies of  cover  pages  only)  by   
 defining  two  categories and  organising  the  pages  on  the digital  multi  touch  tab-   
 le to p. Additionally, the group was provided with  one set of spiral bound print outs     
 of  the  18  cover  pages,  one  laptop  with  digital  copies of  the cover  pages to  flip       
 through, and a wireless keyboar  d/ mouse set to control the pages on the tabletop.    
 After the par ticipants filled  out an initial  questionnaire, we  briefed them on  the    
 task.  The participants  were  asked to  come  to an  agreement as  to  who would  take   
 each of  the three items  to the tabletop area.  We informed them  they could change   
 their seating p  osition, sw ap the selected items w  ith their colleagues and use multi -     
 touch surface  at any tim  e. The participants  were then as  ked to bring  their selected   
 item  to the  table,  take a  seat,  and make  themselves  comfortable,  awaiting fur  ther   
 instructions.  The tabletop  displ ay showed electronic  cover pages  in a pile,  rotated    
 at various angles. We captured the seating  positions of the participants, and the l o-    
 cation  of  the  items  each  placed  on  the  t  able,  before  they  began  the  task.  When   
 asked  to begin,  the group  worked on  the task  (see  Figure 3 )  until the  pages  were     
 organised to  the group‚Äôs satisfaction.  Finally, they filled  out a  post - task questio   n-   
 naire.    
 We collected data from 12 participants (4 groups). They were on average 26.6   
 years old (standard  deviation (SD) = 3.1), 3  were female and 10 r e   ported to  know   
 the  other  group  members. With  respect  to the  p  articipa  nt‚Äôs  exper i ence  of  using         
 display technologies,  8% reported  having no  experience with  large screens, co  m-    
 pared  to  50.0%  having  some,  34%  regular  and  8%  d aily  exper i  ence.  Regarding    
 their  experience of  using  horizontal comp  uter displays,  over  a quarter  of the  pa r-    
 ticipants  had no  experience, w  hile 75%  were somew  hat exper i enced.  Most of  the     
 participants had  some or  regular experience  with touch  intera c tion. We  asked  the       

 Horizontal Interactiv  e Surfaces in Distri buted Assemblies  11        
 participants also about the assembly of artefacts they  usually bring into their mee t-    
 ings. Among the  most mentioned were pens  (100%), note p a per (67%) and mobile     
 phones (67%). Other items brought into meetings  are print outs (92%) and laptops   
 (50 %). However,  25% repor  ted to al  ways brin  g their l  aptops in  to mee t ings.       
 Our observations  reveal  ed that  75% of  the  participants  sat on  the  long side  of      
 the  table. The  predominant  group  seating arrangem  ent had  one  participant sitting   
 at each  long side  and the third  sitting at  the short side  of the  table (see Figure  3 ).        
 Only in one trial, two part  icipants sat side - by -   side at one long table side facing the     
 third colleague  on the  opposite  long side.  Furthermore,  we observed  that  partic   i-   
 pants  who  brought the  laptop  to  the table  sat  down  exclusively at  the  long  side.   
 25%  of the  participants with  the keyboard  and 50%  with  the print  outs sat  at the   
 short  side.  The participants  positioned  keyboard  and  print ou  ts predominantly  in   
 front  of  them,  while they  placed  the  lap top  on  the  side  and  slightly o  riented the     
 laptop  di s play  towards  them.  One  participant  explained  that  the  laptop  ‚Äúscreen     
 prevent ed seeing  the [horizontal  display]. So  it  had to  be sidew  ays.‚Äù The  partic i-       
 pants aligned  the items  with the  border of ho ri   zontal display so  as to  not obscure    
 the display, though th  ey were not instructed to do so.  During the course of the task   
 they  neither changed  their initial  seating p  osition significantly,  nor did  they sw  ap   
 the items they brought to  the table. In one trial, a participant with the  laptop quic k-    
 ly rea r ranged her initially selected seating position at the short side and m  oved to a     
 long  side of  the  table  to sit  side - by  side with  a colleague.  When  asked about  the     
 motivation for  this, she suspected  that she  would have better  access to  the pages     
 on the table in her new  position. In all trials, the participants occasio n ally used the     
 items they place  d on the table, while  in the final phase, th  e intera c  tion on the mul-   
 ti -  touch table dominated.

 such as laptop, keyboard, mouse and set of printouts.    
 In  the post - questionnaire,  we captured  basic ergonomic  factors of  the  tabletop     
 se t ting. Nearly  all of  the participants  (11) report ed hav  ing good reachablity  of the      
 digital cover  pages  o n th  e horizontal  display.  Seven  participants  agreed they  had     
 enough visibility of  the pages, but  4  partici  pants raised issues  on this point. Three     
 of these  four participants  were sitting  at a  shor t side  of the  table.  One pa r  ticipant    
 explained  after the  trial his  strategies  to cope  with this  shortcoming:  he compe n-    
 sated for the poorly visible cover pag  es on the opposite side of his seating position   
 by looking  up and  investigating them in  his print ou  ts in  front of  him. Almost  all    
 participants  assessed the  size  of the  rim  to  be appropriate  and  reported that  they   
 had  enough  space  to  place  their  items.  Concerns  were  raised  as  to  whether  the   
 small rim  at the  long side  of the  table is   sufficient  for  suppor t ing    the laptop.  One      
 participant rated the rim to  be a ‚Äú[g]ood size but too small  for laptop‚Äù and a n   other   
 criticized that ‚Äúthe [long] sides are too small for A4 to fit.‚Äù    
 Distributed collaboration   
 In  everyday  work, it  is  well   establis  hed  that paper  plays a vital  role  in the  ways       
 work  practis  es  are conducted  (e.g.  [ 37 ]   ). G iven  the particu  lar affo  rdances  of the      
 paper medium, it is likely  paper will continue to form a  part of the artefact asse m-      
 blies  within  which  t abletop -    based  work  interactions  will  be  done. While  t  here     

 Horizontal Interactiv  e Surfaces in Distri buted Assemblies  13        
 have been  efforts within  t  abletop research  to  accommodate paper  art e facts  in the        
 interaction, this  has  typically involve d an  explicit attempt to provide comput a    tio n-     
 al  links  between  the  physical  and  digital  worlds  (e.g.  [ 38 ] ).    However,  there  has      
 been  little effort  in  looking at  the  behavioural  practices   of everyday  paper  doc  u-   
 ments  in the  context  of  tabletop  se t  tings  (though  see  recent  work  by  Ruiz et  al .         
 [ 39 ]   ), in real world settings and in particular in distributed env i    ronments.      
 Our concerns in  this  section are  in understanding the  role, value of  and behav-     
 ioural practices  with paper docum  ents and other ar  tefacts  in the context  of distr i b-     
 uted tabletop settin  gs . We would also like  to understand the impact  of the orie nt a-         
 tion of the setting on the ways distributed tabletop collaboration is carried out .      
 C ollaboration appliance Meeting Wizard     
 In articulating  the se concerns,  we draw  in pa r ticular  on observational studies  of a       
 distributed collaboration appliance called  Meeting Wizard. With Meeting  Wizard,   
 a large vertical projected display is used to present information to a group of users.     
 To  interact with  th is  display  surface, multiple  interactive  tablets are  placed  on  a     
 horizontal surface used by the group members to simultaneously point to, navigate   
 through  and  mark up  the  information  on the  vertical  display. Using this  arrang e-      
 ment, the  point  ing and  marking technology is  decoupled spatia  lly from  the vie w-      
 ing surface  providing the benefits  of both vertical displa  y and the config u ration  of     
 the group around a h  or i zontal interaction surface. As we shall see in the fieldwork,     
 this  arrangement  has  particular  implic ations for  how  shared  interactivity is  ma n-     
 aged and the clear d e marcation of  personal vers  us shared resou  rces.

 Fig. 4. A  distr  ibuted meeting in which personal paper resources are marshalled around the tablet     
 while interacting wit  h the large shared pr  oject ed surface.     
 From our fieldwork observations of  Meeting Wizard use in distributed co l lab o-      
 ration,  a  notable  feature  was  how  individuals  in  the  meeting  would  often  have   
 their  own paper  version  of the  digital  document bein  g shared  over  Meeting Wi z-    
 ard. While th e  fact that  paper  documents are  brought  in to a  meeting  is of  course       
 not a new phenomenon, the  distribut  ion of activities across the same document  to-   
 gether  in digital  and paper  form is  nevertheless  worth some  commentary in  light   
 of our co n cerns with distrib   uted media assemblies. In  particular,  the role they play   
 in  the  management  of  ongoing  individual  and  collaborative  activities .  Th  e  k  ey      
 here is the distinction i n the shift between personal and shared use of inform a  tio  n.      
 If we  consider the  documents pres  ent ed on the  shared surface,  these are esse n-     
 tially  visible and  ‚Äúowned‚Äô  by all  those present  in  the distributed  meeting. C  ha n g-     
 ing  the vie  w or  marking  up  the docu  ment is  in  essence  something  that has  to  be   
 achieved  collaboratively;  something  that has  t  o  be  nego tiated  with  other  present    
 parties. Typically  then,  people would  use  some form  of  conversational device  or   
 signal in order  to negotiate  changing  page or  view.  Whil  e this shared view works     
 for  coordinating attention,  individuals may  also w  ant to  look at  different parts  of     
 the d  ocument at  different times to  support a  particular cognitive  strand they  were     
 taking. For  example,  in  response  to  an  ongoing  conversation,  a  particular  issue       
 might have been evoked in  an individual  ‚Äôs mind that relates to  anot  her part of the     
 document. T  hey might  use  their own  paper version  of the docum  ent to go  to that     
 page and explore the  relationshi  p without disrupting the current  conversation flow   

 Horizontal Interactiv  e Surfaces in Distri buted Assemblies  15        
 around the  shared view. This is an  important way of, for example,  fluidly mana g-      
 ing conver sa  tional  threads and introducing new  topics. The important point  here is     
 that  as  a personal  resource,  the  paper  version  can be  controlled  and  manipulated   
 without  incurring  the  social   cos  t  as  sociated  with  neg  otiating  over  a  shared  r e-    
 source.  An  example  of  th is  can  be se  en in  a tele - meeting  between  one group  in       
 London and a nother  group based in Hong Kong.  One of the junior members of the     
 meeting, J, was examining a printou  t of the photographs currently  being di s played     
 on the Meeting Wizard  and currently being discussed. Having examined the paper     
 version  of  the  photographs, J  l  eaned  over  towards  PK  sitting to  the  left  of  him,   
 orienting  the  printout  in  PK‚Äôs  direction. Whil  e  pointing  to  the   printout  J  had  a     
 short  discussion  with  PK.  A  few  moments  later when  approp riate  and when  the      
 other thread  was complete d ,  PK used  the M  eeting Wizard  display to  draw  ever   y-   
 one ‚Äôs attention to  the point that w  as raised in the  prior side discussion.  So  the p a-       
 per, in  this example, as a  personal resource had  supported some individual  cogn i-    
 tion and  then transformed  fluidly into a  conversational resource  for a  parallel side   
 discu s sion  in  preparation  f  or  a  new  thread  while  the  main  discussion  over  the     
 shared document  continued . This illustrates an  example of using  multiple surfa  ces     
 were to support the parallel anal y  sis and threads in a very fluid manner.      
 ‚ÄúIt was useful to have paper copies in front of us as well as on the screen so that two   
 separate discussions could happen at the same time in the same meeting area‚Äù PK,

 The p ublic personal boundary is not  fixed but something that can be   negotiated    
 according to different  circumstance  s ([ 40  , 23 ] ).    Indeed, when it comes to  introdu     c-   
 ing  new  technologies,  the  delicacy  of  this nego  tiation is  often underestim  ated in   
 many tasks and many organisational activities ( e.g.  , [ 37 ]   ).  The tangibility and  m i-      
 cromobility of  the paper document  allowed them  to be  ma n    aged fluid ly  making it    
 clear exactly who should view the document. Another way to allow in   formation  to       
 move from a  pers  onal resource to a shared  reso  urce is when the  pr o jected version     
 of the document  was pointed to the  same page as on  the paper ve r sion of  the do c-      
 ument.  For  opening  up to  the  larger  group ,  the  paper  version  was  less  useful  in     
 their ability to bring th  e information more into the collabor  ative d o main for s  hared     
 visual  reference.   It was  only by  combining  it with  the  electronic version  that the   
 shift could be made  but this was indirect. Having  separate spaces (paper and ele c-      
 tronic)  was important  in  creating a  clearer  permission  management as  well  as al-   
 lowing these personal and share  d uses of the document to happen simultan e ously.      
 Paper versions of the docum ent were also important in providing and managing    
 multiple surfaces. As O‚ÄôHara and  Sellen [ 41  ]  and O‚ÄôHara  et a l     [ 42  ] have  argued  ,       
 concurrently viewable multiple  surfaces are  an important part of  the cognition u n-    
 derlying reading. Quick -  glance access to information on different pages a l lows the     
 information  to be  assimilated together  in ways  that is  difficult without  concu r rent     
 visibility. Observations were made  of people moving attent  ion between their paper       
 printouts and the shared display  in support of information processing and commu-   
 nication activities. This behaviour applie  d more broadly to marshalled i n formation       

 16  M√ºller -   Tomfelde and O‚ÄôHara      
 in  the  table  space  immediately  in  front  of  the  individual. Inde  ed  one  of  the  key     
 values demonstrated  was the  ability to  interact with  the shared  convers a tional r e-       
 source within  the  context  of  document  s  that  had  been  brought  the  mee t ing  and       
 personally marshalled around the tablet (see Fi   gur  e 4).    
 Having a single shared horizontal collaboration  surface, as in standard tabletop      
 setting would only be part of the solution in the way real world distributed co l la b-        
 oration  gets managed. Having  infor  mation distributed  across multiple media  su r-      
 faces (in this instance paper and pro jected displays) pla  ys an important part in how    
 activity fluidly moves from individual, to  loosely coupled collaboration onto more   
 tightly coupled collaboration during the course of a   typical distributed mee t  ing  .     
 However,  there  were  times  to  when  such  dist ributed  assemblies  across  paper     
 and  digital surfaces  cr  eated  difficulties within  distributed  setups.  In  some of  o b-    
 serv a tions  of Meeting  Wizard  in use  during a  distributed  collaboration, we  saw  a     
 local  group  begin  to  use  a  flip  chart  as  shared  visual  resour ce.  The  work  being     
 done  on  the  flip  chart needed  t  o  be  displayed  as  well as  the information  on  the   
 meeting wizard ‚Äì again  an example of the  need for multiple surfaces. But  conve r-        
 sational  attention  of  the collocated  group was  then focused  around  the  activit ies    
 occurring on the flip chart. As this  paper part of th  e assembly was not  available to      
 the remote group,  i.e.,  not part of the distributed assemb  ly  it was more difficult for   
 them to  maintain involvem  ent in the  conversation. In this  sense the  asymmetry of      
 distributed assemblies  ( see, e.g. [    43 ]   ) resulted in certain presence di s   parities  .    
 Negotiating stud  y at a shared ta  bletop    
 Another more  formal  study   we carried  out provides  us  with   further insights  int  o   
 the use of distributed assemblies. Rather than focusing on the formal approach and     
 methods of the experiment, we concentrate in particular on observations  and fin d-    
 ings of  the whole se  tting to further  understanding on  the use of  tabletops. The  e x-    
 periment  was  designed to  capture  effects  of  the inp  ut dev  ice an  d the  wor  kspace     
 orientation  of  the  shared  tabletop  on  various  obje  ctive  and  subjects  parameters.   
 However  in  this subsection,  we  emphasise  the  observations  and  findings  during    
 and after  the experiment  that were n ot  directly under scrutiny  of the main    exper i-     
 ment. To understand the context of these  obser  vations we begin by describing the    
 setting and task the partic i pants worked on.      
 The study was conducted on th  e Braccetto  research platform [ 44  , 45  ] composed         
 of a  horizontal tabletop  unit and  a vertical unit  for teleconferencing.  On the hor i-    
 zontal  LCD  display ,  participants  could  manipulate  the  presented  digital    content     
 us ing touch or  mouse devices as used in prior studies such  as [ 30  , 29 ]   . Two rooms        
 were set  up  with these  workst  ations and  co n nected  via a  computer network.  The     
 vertical display  showed the  video  image of  remote partic i  pants.  Two participants   
 per site  worked  colloc ated and  also remotely  together . The  exper i mental  setup   at       
 one site  is shown  in Figure  5 . O    nly a  few controlled  experiments exist that  use  a   
 complex problem solving  tasks for the investigation into   distributed team co l lab   o-     

 Horizontal Interactiv  e Surfaces in Distri buted Assemblies  17        
 ration .  We  aimed to  create a  task  that was  complex  and quasi - realistic,  re    l evant        
 and  interesting  for participants  to  ensure  their  engagement ,    and  wh  ich  ad  dresses       
 both external  and internal representations  of the art e facts  in the  workspace. Thus,       
 we chose a bushfire survival scena  rio [ 46  ] that fun c  tione  d as a subject of a  negoti-      
 ating task:  g roup  members were  ask   ed to  rank  several items  based on  their value   
 in  surviving a  bushfire.  Due  to the  fact  that Au s  tralia,  where  the experim  ent was   
 conducted,  is  highly  affected  by  bushfires,  it  was  assumed  that  this  topic  mi ght    
 stimulate their engag e ment.      
 Participants in  groups  of f our  were  introduced to  the  task by  viewing  a video    
 describing  the  following  hypothetical  situation:  Their  group  in  a   cottage  in  the   
 Australian  bush  received  news  of  a  nearby  bushfire  approaching  their  location.     
 They  were  then  presented with  a  set  of  12  ite ms  (woolle  n  blankets, cell  phone,    
 map of area,  etc.)  found nearby.  After  viewing the  video scenario the participants   
 were randomly assigned into two groups and  separat  ed into two rooms.  Each pa r-     
 ticipant  received an  A4  page  with a  written  description of  the scenario  presented     
 in the vide  o. This gave them  the oppo r  tunity to  review some of th  e facts. The task    
 was completed in two steps: Fi  rst , participants ranked individually the items based     
 on  their survival value  (priming activity),  and second ,  they  ranked t   he  items  as a   
 group  (consensus activity).  The  participants ranked  the  sets  of  digital images  by   
 attaching digital  post - it notes  with  ranked numbers  on the  items (see Figure  6 a) .          
 In the  individual  ranking, each  partic i pant had  their own  set in  the workspac e.  In      
 the group  ranking, a single  set of items  and post -  it no  tes were available  to all pa r-    
 tic i pants , i.e., shared across the sites.       
 With respect to the top  ics of this chapter  , we observed the following behaviour     
 that  shed  more  light  on  the  integration  of  t he  tabletop  in  the  distributed  setting.    
 Participants used  the  written description  of  the scenario  on  the sheet  of  paper to   
 recall  some of  the  facts. They  did  this  during the  individual  as  well as  the  group     
 ranking part  of the  study. In  most cases, the  participants retreated  from the  actual     
 group activity to  find further hints  to improve the  ranking (see Figure 5  b). When   
 not used, the paper was placed at the side  of the table on the rim.

 The rim around the interactive tabletop also had the function of allowing stan d-     
 ing  participants  to  lean  against  or  rest  their  forearms  on.  Since  the  tabletop  was   
 raised higher than  a standard table for sitting, they  acted more like at a bistr o  table     
 or a bar table. Although the trial lasted abou t 30 ‚Äì   40 minutes each, no partic i  pants   
 complained about the  fact that they had to  stand during the trial. For those  partic i-    
 pants  that  were  asked to  use the  mouse  to  control  the  software  art e fact, the  rim     
 around the tabletop also served as the  location whe re they placed the mouse  to o p-     
 erate with  it. The  setting used  in this  study  was different  to that  described before   
 with the Meeting Wizard. In the  fiel  d study the vertical display space was  used to   
 provide  a  shared information  space  and  audio conference  ca ll  was  used  to  co m-     
 mun i cate. In  the study a  rich video link  between the  sites was established  and the     
 horizontal interactive surface was used to  display and access shared inform a tion.      
 While this seems to  be a major difference between the distributed settin  g s, we    
 can observe commonalities in the way the settings are used with respect to orienta-   
 tion  and direction  . To  further  investigate th  is aspect,  we  draw on  the  results  of a   
 follow - on mock -  up study [  47 ]   . This study was conducted after subjects had pa r ti c-          
 ipated in  the previou  s experiment.  The preceding  activity can  be seen  as a  primer   
 for  this  mock - up  study  where  we captured  their  preferences  for  alternative pla t-      
 form - setups and configurations. T  he subjects were asked to work on the fo l lowing        
 design task. They were  given a set  of small scale models  of the basic el e ments of       
 the platform, such  as displays in landscape and portr  ait layout and wor k space pla   t-   
 forms  with different  tilts. The  models  were created  from thick  foam a  nd we  pr o-      
 vided blu - tack, e.g., to place ‚Äòscreens on the wall‚Äô.      
 The important outcome of the study was tha  t over 70 percent of the participa  nts   
 tilted the  horizontal w  orkspace in  the mock - up  design. Ask  ed for  thei  r preference       
 the users clearly showed that they conceptualized basic ergonomic issues of the i n-     
 teractive  horizontal  tabletop  in  front  of  them  with  regard  to  visibility  of  info r-    
 ma tion on  the display and re  achability of elements w  hen using the touch  input d e-     
 vices.  One  subjects  stated  that  ‚Äú Tilted  table  a  llows  a  bett  er  view  [ ‚Ä¶]   of  the

 Discussion   
 Our fie ld studies and findings  from  the more formal  experiments revealed two i m-     
 portant  a  spects  regarding   deployment  of  inte  ractive  t  abletops  in  distributed  a s-    
 semblies. First, whether addre  ssing coll o cated  or distributed collaboration, the use     
 of paper and other artefacts of the everyday env i ronments such as offices and semi     
 public spaces plays an important role. Given this, we discussed the sign  ificance of     
 the boundaries of  interactivity of  tabletop setting s , i.e,  the interplay     of   inte r active     
 and  non -i  nteractive  areas  on a  horizontal surface.  Second,  our  investigation  into    
 distributed  collaboration emphasis es  that    pr  esence  of  vert i cal shared  workspaces     
 o r  video  mediated  communication  shape  the  way   co l   laboration  is organis  ed  and    
 carried out  around  tabletops . This  has implications  on how  the horizontal  intera  c-   
 tion surfaces are used in distributed a s sem  blies.      
 Boundaries of Interactivity   
 O ur  concerns   w ith  respect  to  interactivity  and  non -   interactivity  are  not  with  the      
 sp e cifics o  f the  particular interactive  tabletop deployed  in the  field  study or used       
 in ex  periments . We  recognise  some of  the specific  issues discussed  here may  not     
 be manifest  with  o ther  systems, such  as mul   ti -   touch  interactive  surfaces. We  r e c-       
 ognise too , that there may be  design solutions for the difficulties high  lighted in the     
 caf√© - bar stud  y. However, our  intent   was  to show  a  demonstrable re  lationship b       e-   
 tween  the  interactive  and  the non -    interactive  areas  and to  provide early  insi  ghts     
 while conducting the  exploratory rim study .  In  light of  this, we  would  argue  that     
 this relationship should be  given further attention in the context of emerging inte r-      
 active  surface  solutions  and  distribu ted  assemblies .  As  we  have  seen  from  the     
 findings, this  relationship between interactivity  and non - interactivity  is a complex     
 and dynamic  one that  is continuously  managed and evolved  within the  context of   
 the different so  cial settings.     
 How we design for  th is is an im  portant question. Wh  ile there were  times when    
 the clear  delineation  between  interacti  ve  and  non - interactive  elements  was  i m-        
 por t ant (e.g.  rim vs. touch  screen), this is  only a small  piece of the  design puzzle ,      
 and the  relationship goes  beyond  a simple  static s  pecification of  i n  teractive a  reas     
 and  non - interactive  areas.  This  is  because  spatial  arrangement  of  interactive  vs.     
 non - interactive  touch  was sh  aped by  multiple  and  dynamic  factors,  including di-     
 me n sions of  the table surface (e.g.  height, leng th, width,  diameter), number  of a c-       
 tors around th  e table, the relationship  between them, pa r  ticular top  ics of convers a-    

 20  M√ºller -   Tomfelde and O‚ÄôHara      
 tion and  arrangement of  artefacts on  the table. W  ith many of  these fa c  tors  conti n-    
 uously  changing,  the  movement  between  interactive  and  non - interactive  is  ulti-     
 mately a  soci  al accomplishment collaboratively achieved by  a group of  a c tors. In     
 designing for this relationship then, it is  important to go beyond the static deline a-    
 tion  of  i n  teractive  and  non -  interactive  regions  on  the  surface.  Rather,  the  focus   
 should  be  on supporting  social  mechanisms  that en  able and  manage  fluid  trans i-    
 tion between i n  teractive and non -  inter  active.     
 Directionality   
 In the field study  with the Meeting Wizard as  well as in the experiment in  the hor-   
 izontal  shared workspace  it b  ecame clear  that both  the  shared vertical  and shared    
 horizontal work space with a video link imposed directionalit  y on the local setting.   
 Moving away f  rom an arte  fact withi  n the distr  ibuted ass  embly and wor k ing on fli  p      
 chart s  may  interrupt  flow of  the   conversation and  collaboration.  In  the mock - up       
 study we saw  users‚Äô preferences for  tilted workspace s   . This  may be based  on their      
 intuition  of  what  constitutes  a  more  effective  work  e n vironment  that  has  more     
 comfortable reach  and better viewing angles.  However, tilting the  inte r    action su r-    
 face  has  implication s  for  its orientation  and .  Observers  of  a  vertical  whiteboard       
 display perceive  di s  played  information in  the same  orientation from  any position    
 in front of the display  (i.e., position indepen d ent orientation). The perceived orie n-      
 tation around  a horizontal surface  on the other  hand, depends  e n  tirely on the po  si-   
 tion  of each  observer r  elative to  the display.  Attributes  such as  top,  down,  left or   
 right do  not  e x ist. Any  tilt angle  as sugge  sted by  the participants  reintroduces   d i-      
 rectionality ,  i.e.,  the  notion  of  top,  down,  left  and  right  to  the  tabl e top  display.      
 This m  ight encou r age  users to  situate themselves  in  front of  the  lowest side  of  a     
 tilted tabletop. In  this arrang e ment, the viewing angl  e on the horizontal workspac  e     
 is optimal for all  participants. Since users stand or  sit at the tilted tabl e  top side - by -      
 side,  the size  of  the  group will  be  directly pro  po r tional to  the  size  of the  scr een.      
 The participants may not  have realised the ramifications of tilting a fully  horiz  o n-    
 tal tabletop  leading to th  e loss of  the affordance of  placing and  su p porting objects     
 on the surface.    
 The important  aspect of  our findings  is that  artef  acts in  the distr ibuted  asse m-     
 blies have the potential to provide dir  ectionality to a setting. This holds  for vertical   
 as well  as horizontal  shared workspace  and may  be a  key convention  to facilitate   
 the collabo  ration in distrib  uted settings. H  aving too  many shared  display in a  di s-    
 tributed setting m  ay lead to ambiguous  situation where participants  of the mee t  ing   
 address different areas in  the shared environment. Finally, the direc  tionality of the     
 horizontal  surface may  become  aligned  with the  directionality  of the  work  env i-    
 r onment imposed by the vertical video di s  play.      

 Horizontal Interactiv  e Surfaces in Distri buted Assemblies  21        
 Conclusion   
 We  presented  our  work   on  horizontal  inte  ractive  surf  aces  in  distrib  uted  asse m-    
 blies. With the term distributed assemb  lies we want to emphasis that real - life ta b-       
 letop setting may not be  considered is o  lated points of interaction, but rather a  s part   
 of an assembly of  artefacts with which users can interact. The boundaries of  inte r-    
 activity  of  tabletop  setting s   have  been  identified  as  important  for    better  unde r-     
 stand ing the integration  of horizo n  tal  interactive displays. The  non -  interactive rim      
 around  the  area  of  interactivity  on  the  surface  provides  the  affo r dance  to  place     
 othe r, possibly interactive artefacts of  the assembly. The observ a tion in the  studies      
 in  distributed  settings  show  how a  video  mediated  communication  di s  play  or   a      
 shared  vertical  display have  a  tendency  to  i m    pose  directionality  on  the  settings     
 toward  the  remote  parties.  Implications  for   tabl e   top  setting  have  been  discussed   
 such as tilting the horizontal inte r active surfaces for better ergonomics.

 This paper surveys emerging design research on co-located group interaction with tabletop displays as an approach toward developing an upper-limb movement rehabilitation system for acquired brain injury (ABI). Traditional approaches and newer virtual reality interventions for physical therapy tend to focus on individuals interacting one-on-one with a therapist in a clinical space --- this is both labor intensive and costly. Co-located tabletop environments have been shown to enhance the engagement of users, translating to skill acquisition. We describe the principles of group interaction that inform our understanding of motor rehabilitation using interactive media; explore four constructs from interactive tabletop research that may influence the design of co-located systems for rehabilitation: 1) physical space, 2) group awareness, 3) territoriality, and 4) interaction simultaneity; and consider how each construct can be expressed in particular design solutions for rehabilitation of ABI.

 Current approaches for movement rehabilitation tend to focus on individuals interacting one-on-one with a therapist in a clinical setting ‚Äì this is both labor intensive and costly. Group-based rehabilitation games provide new ways to leverage therapy through observational learning, peer support, and social facilitation while reducing healthcare costs. There is strong evidence to suggest group therapy can promote participation and social interaction to broaden the outcomes for patients. Also, game elements that encourage groups to work together (face-to-face) can enhance the engagement of users and promote skill acquisition. However, the integration of game design in a group rehabilitation context does not have a strong presence in current therapy. In this chapter we outline the principles of group interaction that expand our concept of motor rehabilitation. We pay particular attention to game design for interactive tabletop displays that support multiple players co-located in the same physical space. The potential benefits and characteristics of group interaction and tabletop games are discussed to develop a design framework for movement rehabilitation.

 People inherently share spaces with other people. Congenitally, interactive technologies and ubiquitous environments shape our opportunities for enacting social relations. Proxemics and Spatial Sharing have been suggested as foundations for our understanding of the socio-spatial aspects of computing. By tandeming these theoretical perspectives in a set of cases in the office domain, we develop a contribution comprised of 3 key sensitizing concepts: Proxemic Malleability, Proxemic Threshold and Proxemic Gravity articulating socio-spatial qualities at the interplay between interactive systems, spaces, interior elements and co-located people. The sensitizing concepts qualify interaction designers in considering proxemic consequences of technology design; they serve both as analytic lenses and as generative instruments in a design process. The proposed sensitizing concepts and the theoretical work of the paper contribute to enhanced Socio-spatial literacy in HCI.

 Tabletop systems support simultaneous multi-user multi-touch interaction to select and manipulate digital contents such as text, images, and videos directly and in a natural way. These digital contents require the proper orientation to perform co-located collaborative tasks. To achieve this, some orientation techniques are also proposed in different domains. But, the orientation issue is still reported for collaborative medical image analysis around tabletop systems. The presence of the inappropriate digital content-orientation on tabletop displays limits the collaborative medical image analysis. It also decreases the visibility, accessibility and readability of digital contents during co-located collaborative interaction. This paper presents a user study to evaluate usability of the two different orientation techniques for diagnosing and monitoring of medical images from the user perspective. Subsequently, the comparative analysis of those techniques is presented and discussed based on the obtained data. The findings suggest that the manual-orientation technique provide better usability as compared to the global-orientation technique for diagnosing and monitoring the medical images. Finally, the future work is suggested based on the obtained findings to enhance the usability.

 In the past decade there has been increasing interest in studying tabletop technologies in HCI. Using Gartners Hype Cycle as an analytical framework, this paper presents developments in tabletop research within the last decade. The objective is to determine level of maturity of tabletop technologies with respect to the research foci and the extent to which tabletops have shown their worth in real world settings. We identify less studied topics in the current body of literature with the primary aim of evoking further discussions of current and future research challenges. We analyzed 542 research publications and categorized these according to eight types of research foci. Findings show that only 3% of all studies are conducted in natural settings, i.e. there is a clear tendency to emphasize laboratory evaluations of tabletop technology. Also, very few studies demonstrate relative benefits of tabletops over other technologies in collaborative settings (1%). We argue for a need to increase emphasis on understanding real-world use and impact rather than developing new tabletop technologies.

 While screen mirroring is an integral part of many video mediated collaborations, current systems are limited in their ability to include ad hoc screen mirroring from personal devices of collocated participants on each end of a video call. In this paper we introduce a system that addresses this limitation by enabling lightweight multi-user wireless smartphone mirroring within a video call. The system enables multiple smartphones to share both digital content as well as physical artefacts when mirroring the live view from the smartphone camera feed. We present a study of the system in use for a distributed design task. The findings explore how shared access to screen mirroring facilitates a fluid switching of floor control in the meeting and smooth interleaving of individual, sub group and full group shared activities. Further, the findings highlight the importance of smartphone mobility in enabling access to screen mirroring from the sites of individual work and sites of various physical artefacts and the significance of this for the dynamics of a video mediated collaboration.

 Interactive tables are more frequently being suggested to support collaborative and co-localized applications. They can be tactile, tangible or mixed. New sensory entries enable users to manipulate different types of tangible objects. The purpose of this article is to propose a global interaction model that associates multiagent system concepts with interactive table entities. The model incorporates simultaneously usable entities: virtual and tangible entities. The virtual entities can be seen through video projection or the use of a screen integrated into the interactive table. The tangible entities are physical objects that can be manipulated by one or more users around the table. These objects are detected through dedicated sensors. A case study illustrates the proposal. The study incorporates the management of a road traffic simulator using the TangiSense interactive table; this table is equipped with RFID technology. The illustrations mainly show communication between the different agents involved in the simulation.

 Multitouch wall-sized displays afford new forms of collaboration: They can be used up close by several users simultaneously, offer high resolution, and provide sufficient space for intertwining individual and joint work. The difference to displays without these capabilities is not well understood. To better understand the collaboration of groups around high-resolution multitouch wall displays, we conducted an exploratory study. Pairs collaborated on a problem-solving task using a 2.8m √ó 1.2m multitouch display with 24.8 megapixels. The study examines how participants collaborate; navigate relative to the display and to each other; and interact with and share the display. Participants physically navigated among different parts of the display, switched fluidly between parallel and joint work, and shared the display evenly. The results contrast earlier research that suggests difficulties in sharing and collaborating around wall displays. The study suggests that multitouch wall displays can support different collaboration styles and fluid transitions in group work.

 Current interfaces for common information visualizations such as bar graphs, line graphs, and scatterplots usually make use of the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and a Pointer) interface paradigm with its frequently discussed problems of multiple levels of indirection via cascading menus, dialog boxes, and control panels. Recent advances in interface capabilities such as the availability of pen and touch interaction challenge us to re-think this and investigate more direct access to both the visualizations and the data they portray. We conducted a Wizard of Oz study to explore applying pen and touch interaction to the creation of information visualization interfaces on interactive whiteboards without implementing a plethora of recognizers. Our wizard acted as a robust and flexible pen and touch recognizer, giving participants maximum freedom in how they interacted with the system. Based on our qualitative analysis of the interactions our participants used, we discuss our insights about pen and touch interactions in the context of learnability and the interplay between pen and touch gestures. We conclude with suggestions for designing pen and touch enabled interactive visualization interfaces.

 Caf√© society is something that many of us as customers and/or social theorists take for granted. Caf√©s are places where we are not simply served hot beverages but are also in some way partaking of a specific form of public life. It is this latter aspect that has attracted the attention of social theorists, especially J√ºrgen Habermas, and leads them to locate the caf√© as a key place in the development of modernity. Our approach to caf√©s is to ‚Äòturn the tables‚Äô on theories of the public sphere and return to just what the life of a particular caf√© consists of, and in so doing re-specify a selection of topics related to public spaces. The particular topics we deal with in a ‚Äòworldly manner‚Äô are the socio-material organisation of space, informality and rule following. In as much as we are able we have drawn on an ethnomethodological way of doing and analysing our ethnographic studies.

 Although privacy is broadly recognized as a dominant concern for the development of novel interactive technologies, our ability to reason analytically about privacy in real settings is limited. A lack of conceptual interpretive frameworks makes it difficult to unpack interrelated privacy issues in settings where information technology is also present. Building on theory developed by social psychologist Irwin Altman, we outline a model of privacy as a dynamic, dialectic process. We discuss three tensions that govern interpersonal privacy management in everyday life, and use these to explore select technology case studies drawn from the research literature. These suggest new ways for thinking about privacy in socio-technical environments as a practical matter.

 The t-Room is a remote computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) system that we are develop- ing. Our approach is to build rooms with an identical layout, including walls of display screens on which users and physical or virtual objects are all shown at life size, and to provide symmetry of awareness and immersion in each other's physical space. This allows users in the t-Rooms to feel as if they were in the same room. Furthermore, by introducing recording and playback capabilities to the activities that occur within the t-Room, we can achieve asynchronous communication that overcomes the temporal barrier. The t-Room has greater potential to reproduce reality and awareness in remote collaboration than con- ventional videoconferencing systems. Moreover, as a step toward the future phone, it will enable us to implement a wide variety of telecommunication services that give the feeling of being in the same room and to create a new social interaction style through a large-scale immersive user interface.

 This chapter discusses about the computer for the 21st century and the tabs. Tabs are the smallest components of embodied virtuality. Because they are interconnected, tabs will expand on the usefulness of existing inch-scale computers, such as the pocket calculator and the pocket organizer. Tabs will also take on functions that no computer performs today. For example, computer scientists at PARC and other research laboratories around the world have begun working with active badges‚Äîclip-on computers roughly the size of an employee ID card, first developed by the Olivetti Cambridge research laboratory. These badges can identify themselves to receivers placed throughout a building, thus making it possible to keep track of the people or objects to which they are attached. The chapter also discusses about page-size machines known as pads.

 Media Space and Communicative Asymmetries: Preliminary Observations of Video-Mediated Interaction    
   
 Article

 Despite the growing interest in using audio-visual technologies to support communication and collaborative work among individuals in different locations, we still have relatively little understanding of the organization of video-mediated interaction. In the following article, we discuss some findings of recent research concerning interpersonal communication in a sophisticated multimedia office environment. Based on the detailed naturalistic analysis of individuals collaborating on various tasks during their day-to-day working lives, we explore the extent to which the media space provides a satisfactory means for interpersonal communication and ordinary sociability. In particular, the research suggests that audio-visual technology introduces certain asymmetries into interpersonal communication that can transform the impact of visual and vocal conduct.

 From ‚Äúfrozen conflict‚Äù to enduring rivalry: reassessing the Nagorny Karabakh conflict   
 July 2015  ¬∑ Nationalities Papers    
 Laurence Broers 
  This article draws on international relations theory to attempt a reframing of the Armenian‚ÄìAzerbaijani conflict in Nagorny Karabakh as an enduring rivalry (ER): a particular kind of interstate conflict known for its longevity and stability. The article begins by identifying a number of conceptual deficits circulating around this conflict, notably the notion that it is a ‚Äúfrozen conflict,‚Äù before ... [Show full abstract]  introducing the ER framework and its analytical dividends for this case. Different layers of the ER between Armenia and Azerbaijan are then explored at systemic, interstate, domestic, decision-maker, and temporal levels, with a view more toward identifying directions for future research than conclusive findings. Among the article's tentative conclusions are the primacy of endogenous over exogenous factors in explaining the durability of the rivalry between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the impacts of the passage of time on the human and physical geography of the territory under dispute, and the convergence of conflict dynamics across disparate levels.

 Contrast Medium Utilization   
 January 2009    
 Dominik Fleischmann 
  Margaret C. C. Lin 
  Contrast medium (CM) administration remains an integral part of thoracic and cardiovascular CT. While simple, empiric injection protocols (fixed volume and fixed scanning delay) are sufficient for non-vascular CM-enhanced thoracic CT, cardiac and CT angiographic applications require more sophistication. The goal is to achieve strong enhancement of the vascular territory (or territories) of ... [Show full abstract]  interest synchronized with CT data acquisition, which requires integrating knowledge of arterial enhancement dynamics with the technical capabilities and acquisition parameters of the CT scanner. The increasing breadth of cardiovascular CT applications, ranging from pulmonary CTA over left atrial mapping, coronary and thoracic CTA, to complex applications aiming at simultaneous opacification of systemic and pulmonary circulations with minimal artifacts, make this a challenging task. CT scanner technology is continuously evolving, with scan times becoming shorter with every new CT scanner generation.

 State Reform in Education Finance: Territorial and Social Strategies   
 January 1991  ¬∑ Publius The Journal of Federalism    
 Kenneth K. Wong 
  As of January 1991, state education finance systems had been overturned by the courts in twelve states and upheld by the courts in another fourteen. This article examines the ways in which states have responded to the challenge of equity in school finance. Equity reforms are rooted in two kinds of inequities in public elementary and secondary education. First, state governments can address ... [Show full abstract]  interdistrict or territorial inequity that is due to the disparity in local taxable wealth. Second, state governments can address the social inequity that arises from the presence of special-needs populations within a district. A reform strategy is likely to reflect a state's relative emphases on territorial and social inequities. The common tendency, however, is to focus on territorial equity. These policy tendencies are shaped by various state political and institutional factors.

 The Bear Cult and Kurgans of the Scythian Elite   
 September 2019  ¬∑ Archaeology Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia    
 V. I. Gulyaev 
  This study, based on artifacts from high-ranking kurgans of the northern Black Sea region (700‚Äì300 BC), addresses the little-studied bear motif in Scythian culture and its relevance for the ancient inhabitants of this region and of the adjacent territories. It is a wide-held view that the image of the brown bear had been borrowed from the Ananyino culture of the Kama. Variation of this motif is ... [Show full abstract]  described and its chronology is assessed. Two principal iconographic versions are known in Scythian art‚Äîthe animal is shown either en face, in the so-called sacrifi cial posture, or drinking (in profi le, with a bowed head). Such representations occur most often on gold-plated ritual bowls and ornaments of the horse harness. Both the chronology and the distribution range of these artifacts disagree with the idea that the bear motif was a loan from forest cultures. Rather, it appears to be inherently Scythian, having originated around 700 BC together with other images of the animal style. Apparently, some form of the bear cult was practiced by the Scythian elite.
