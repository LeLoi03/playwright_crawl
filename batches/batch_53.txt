 Keynote Talks  
 Multimodal, Multilingual Generative AI: From Multicultural Contextualization to Empathetic Reasoning   
 Dr. Nancy F. Chen   
  
  We will share about MeraLion (Multimodal Empathetic Reasoning and Learning In One Network), our generative AI efforts in Singapore’s National Multimodal Large Language Model Programme. Speech and audio information is rich in providing more comprehensive understanding of spatial and temporal reasoning in addition to social dynamics that goes beyond semantics derived from text alone. Cultural nuances and multilingual peculiarities add another layer of complexity in understanding human interactions. In addition, we will draw use cases in education to highlight research endeavors, technology deployment experience and application opportunities.   
   
 Biography:  Dr. Nancy F. Chen is an A*STAR fellow, who leads the Multimodal Generative AI group, heads the Artificial Intelligence for Education (AI4EDU) programme at I2R (Institute for Infocomm Research) and is a principal investigator at CFAR (Centre for Frontier AI Research), A*STAR. Dr. Chen’s recent work in large language models have won honors at ACL 2024, including Area Chair Award and Best Paper Award for Cross-Cultural Considerations in Natural Language Processing. Dr. Chen consistently garners best paper awards for her AI research applied to diverse applications. Examples include IEEE ICASSP 2011 (forensics), APSIPA 2016 (education), SIGDIAL 2021 (social media), MICCAI 2021 (neuroscience), and EMNLP 2023 (healthcare). Multilingual spoken technology from her team has led to commercial spin-offs and has been deployed at Singapore’s Ministry of Education to support home-based learning. Dr. Chen has supervised 100+ students and staff. She has won professional awards from USA National Institute of Health, IEEE, Microsoft, P&G, UNESCO, and L’Oréal. She servers as Program Chair of NeurIPS 2025, APSIPA Board of Governors (2024-2026), IEEE SPS Distinguished Lecturer (2023-2024), Program Chair of ICLR 2023, Board Member of ISCA (2021-2024), and is honoured as Singapore 100 Women in Tech (2021).

 Manga109 and MangaUB: How Far Can Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) Go in Understanding Manga?   
 Prof. Kiyoharu Aizawa   
  
  Manga is a Japanese content that has gained global recognition. Manga is a unique multimedia format that combines both images and text. We created a dataset called Manga109, composed of 109 manga comic books. In 2015, we released a dataset containing approximately 20,000 manga pages, and in 2018, we published an extended version with annotations for more than 500,000 objects, including characters and speech balloons on each page. It is the largest manga dataset in the world with such detailed manual annotations. Manga109 allows for academic use, and we have distributed over 2,000 copies of the dataset to date. Various research efforts have been made using this dataset, both domestically and internationally. For example, different groups have tackled tasks such as character recognition, expression recognition, dialogue recognition, speaker identification, and onomatopoeia recognition and more. In this talk, the journey of Manga109, from its beginning to the present, and show MangaUB benchmark dataset for rapidly advancing large multimodal models (LMMs) to assess the current state of LMMs’ manga comprehension.   
   
 Biography:  Prof. Kiyoharu Aizawa received the B.E., the M.E., and the Dr. Eng. degrees in Electrical Engineering all from the University of Tokyo, in 1983, 1985, and 1988, respectively. He is a professor with the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, and Director of VR center, University of Tokyo. He was a visiting assistant professor with the University of Illinois from 1990 to 1992. His research fields are multimedia, image processing, and computer vision, with a particular interest in interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary issues. He received the 1990, 1998 Best Paper Awards, the 1991 Achievement Award, 1999 Electronics Society Award from IEICE Japan, and the 1998 Fujio Frontier Award, the 2002 and 2009 Best Paper Award, and 2013, 2021 Achievement award from ITE Japan, and the IBM Japan Science Prize in 2002. He is on the Editorial Board of ACM TOMM. He served as the Editor-in-Chief of Journal of ITE Japan, an Associate Editor of IEEE TIP, TCSVT, TMM, and MultiMedia.

He is a Fellow of IEEE, IEICE, ITE and a member of Science Council of Japan.   
   
 Multi-modal foundation models in the automotive industry   
 Dr. Andrei Bursuc   
  
  The tremendous progress of deep-learning-based approaches to image understanding problems has inspired new advanced perception functionalities for autonomous systems. However, real-world perception systems often require models that can learn from large bulks of unlabeled and uncurated data with few labeled samples, usually costly to select and annotate. In contrast, typical supervised methods require extensive collections of carefully selected labeled data, a condition that is seldom fulfilled in practical applications. Self-supervised learning (SSL) arises as a promising line of research to mitigate this gap by training foundation models using various supervision signals extracted from the data itself, without any human-generated labels.While most popular SSL methods revolve around web image datasets, new diverse forms of self-supervision are starting to be investigated for autonomous driving (AD). AD represents a unique sandbox for SSL methods as it brings among the largest public data collections in the community with different paired sensors (multiple cameras, Lidar, radar, ultrasonics) and provides some of the most challenging computer vision tasks: object detection, depth estimation, image-based odometry and localization, etc. Here, the canonical SSL pipeline (i.e., self-supervised pre-training of a model and fine-tuning it on a downstream task) is revisited and extended to utterly new SSL approaches for computer vision and robotics (e.g., world models), but also to new downstream usages of pre-trained foundation models, such as cross-sensor distillation, auto-labelling, data mining, architecture re-purposing. This talk will provide a tour of different forms of foundation models across multiple sensor types equipping today's and tomorrow's vehicles in a quest towards annotation-efficient and reliable perception systems.   
   
 Biography:  Dr. Andrei Bursuc is a senior research scientist and deputy scientific director at valeo.ai and research associate at the Astra Inria project team in Paris working on perception for assisted and autonomous driving. His research interests concern reliability of deep neural networks, learning with limited supervision and multi-modal multi-sensor perception. Andrei is also teaching at Ecole Polytechnique and at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. Previously he was a research scientist at Safran Tech in the aerospace industry. Prior to that he was a postdoctoral researcher at Inria Paris, within the Willow project team working with Josef Sivic and Ivan Laptev, and Inria Rennes with Hervé Jégou. He did his PhD at Ecole des Mines Paris and Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs France with Francoise Preteux and Titus Zaharia on visual content indexing and retrieval.Andrei is member of the ELLIS society and is regularly part of the technical program committee for CVPR, ICCV, ECCV and NeurIPS. Previously he co-organized the CVPR’20-’21 and ECCV’22 tutorials on self-supervised learning, and the ICCV’23 and ECCV’24 tutorials on reliability and uncertainty estimation.

  To prepare your submission, refer to the submission guideline   

 Special Session  
 Special sessions at MMM 2025 will focus on state-of-the-art research directions within the multimedia field. Special session papers, which can be invited or submitted, will supplement the regular research papers and be included in the proceedings of the conference. Special sessions should generally be organized in a panel format, where the authors have reduced time to present their work, followed by an extensive Q&A session with the audience. This has been shown to work well in recent editions of MMM.  
 The panel format is a general guideline rather than a strict requirement. If a proposal envisages a potential for a large number of submissions, or if particular value may be provided by the additional discussions that could come with the format of longer special session activities, we are open to such a submission and would negotiate it further.  
 Special Session Submission Process  
 Normally, each special session will include four to five papers. In addition to invited papers, if any, the conference will also welcome open submissions to special sessions. In order to ensure the high quality of accepted papers, all papers submitted to special sessions including invited papers, will be peer-reviewed through a strict review process. If a special session has many high-quality submissions, some of the submissions might be moved to regular sessions. The review process will be coordinated with the main technical program review process of the MMM, as coordinated by the PC chairs. The organizers of each special session must provide 1-2 reviews per submitted / invited paper, while the regular program committee will provide another two reviews. Final decision on acceptance / rejection will be made jointly by the special session organizers and the MMM 2025 PC chairs.  
 Special session papers must follow the same guidelines as regular research papers with respect to restrictions on formatting, length and double-blind reviews.  
 Special Session Proposal Guidelines  
 Please include the following information in your proposal:  
 Title of the proposed special session. 
  Name, affiliation, brief biography and contact information for each of the organizers. 
  A session abstract including significance justification and a brief overview of the state-of-the-art of the proposed special session topic. | Note: The session abstract should be in a format that can be copied directly to the conference web-page to advertise the session. 
  List of invited papers, if applicable, including for each paper: tentative title, author list, and preferably a short abstract. 
  Proposal for arrangement of the reviews from session organizers (e.g. list of reviewers for the special session). 
  Description of the session format (e.g. panel, technical talks poster session). 
  Plans for advertising the special session (e.g. targeted distribution lists, projects, communities). 
  If applicable, plans for exploitation of the results of the special session (e.g. summary papers). 
  Proposals will be evaluated based on the timeliness of the topic and relevance to MMM, anticipated quality of papers in the proposed session and the other information from the list above provided by the organisers.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Please submit proposals containing the information from above by email to the Community Direction chairs using subject “MMM 2025 Special Session Proposal” by the submission deadline (in the Important Dates section) with the email below:  
 mmm2025-coord@googlegroups.com

 Special Session  
 Special sessions at MMM 2025 will focus on state-of-the-art research directions within the multimedia field. Special session papers, which can be invited or submitted, will supplement the regular research papers and be included in the proceedings of the conference. Special sessions should generally be organized in a panel format, where the authors have reduced time to present their work, followed by an extensive Q&A session with the audience. This has been shown to work well in recent editions of MMM.  
 The panel format is a general guideline rather than a strict requirement. If a proposal envisages a potential for a large number of submissions, or if particular value may be provided by the additional discussions that could come with the format of longer special session activities, we are open to such a submission and would negotiate it further.  
 Special Session Submission Process  
 Normally, each special session will include four to five papers. In addition to invited papers, if any, the conference will also welcome open submissions to special sessions. In order to ensure the high quality of accepted papers, all papers submitted to special sessions including invited papers, will be peer-reviewed through a strict review process. If a special session has many high-quality submissions, some of the submissions might be moved to regular sessions. The review process will be coordinated with the main technical program review process of the MMM, as coordinated by the PC chairs. The organizers of each special session must provide 1-2 reviews per submitted / invited paper, while the regular program committee will provide another two reviews. Final decision on acceptance / rejection will be made jointly by the special session organizers and the MMM 2025 PC chairs.  
 Special session papers must follow the same guidelines as regular research papers with respect to restrictions on formatting, length and double-blind reviews.  
 Special Session Proposal Guidelines  
 Please include the following information in your proposal:  
 Title of the proposed special session. 
  Name, affiliation, brief biography and contact information for each of the organizers. 
  A session abstract including significance justification and a brief overview of the state-of-the-art of the proposed special session topic. | Note: The session abstract should be in a format that can be copied directly to the conference web-page to advertise the session. 
  List of invited papers, if applicable, including for each paper: tentative title, author list, and preferably a short abstract. 
  Proposal for arrangement of the reviews from session organizers (e.g. list of reviewers for the special session). 
  Description of the session format (e.g. panel, technical talks poster session). 
  Plans for advertising the special session (e.g. targeted distribution lists, projects, communities). 
  If applicable, plans for exploitation of the results of the special session (e.g. summary papers). 
  Proposals will be evaluated based on the timeliness of the topic and relevance to MMM, anticipated quality of papers in the proposed session and the other information from the list above provided by the organisers.

  Some preliminary information is here 
 CFP: | A printable version of the CFP will be available here 
 Springer: | This is Springer's Book Authors' Code of Conduct ( Book of conduct  ). Take it into account for submission to MDAI. 
 Aims and goals: | In MDAI we are particularly interested in the different facets of decision processes in a broad sense. This includes model building and all kind of mathematical tools for data aggregation, information fusion, and decision making; tools to help decision in data science problems (including e.g., statistical and machine learning algorithms as well as data visualization tools); and algorithms for data privacy and transparency-aware methods so that data processing processes and decisions made from them are fair, transparent, explainable and avoid unnecessary disclosure of sensitive information.  
 The MDAI conference includes tracks on the topics of (i) data science and machine learning, (ii) data privacy, (iii) aggregation funcions, (iv) human decision making, (v) graphs and (social) networks, and (vi) information security. The conference has been since 2004 a forum for researchers to discuss last results into these areas of research.  
  
 MDAI 2024 is the 21th MDAI conference. Previous conferences were celebrated in Barcelona (2004)  , Tsukuba (2005)  , Tarragona (2006)  , Kitakyushu (2007)  , Sabadell (2008)  , Awaji Island (2009)  , Perpinyà (2010)  , Changsha (2011)  , Girona (2012)  , Barcelona (2013)  , Tokyo (2014)  , Skövde (2015)  , Sant Julià de Lòria (2016)  , Kitakyushu (2017)  , Mallorca (2018)  , Milan (2019)  , cancelled due to COVID (2020)  , Umeå (2021)  , Sant Cugat (2022)  , Umeå (2023)  .  
 MDAI is rated as a CORE B conference by the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia - CORE. |  
 Publication: | Proceedings with accepted papers are to be published in the LNAI/LNCS series (Springer-Verlag) and distributed at the conference, as done in previous conferences.  
 Besides, papers, that according to the evaluation of the referees, are not suitable for the LNAI but that have some merits will be published in a USB/ISBN proceedings and scheduled in the MDAI program. Direct submission for the USB/ISBN proceedings is also possible. Deadlines here  . 
 Topics of interest: | Original papers in the areas mentioned above are sought. More detailed information on the tracks of the conference here  .

  DEADLINE USB/ISBN: May 15th, 2024 

 DS Track. | Data science and machine learning track.  Data science is the science of data. Its goal is to explain processes and objects through the available data. Statistical and Machine learning provide tools for building data-driven models. They are used to make informed decisions and explanations, using the knowledge extracted from the data. Models need to be fair, transparent, explainable and avoid unnecessary disclosure of sensitive information. Original contributions on methods, models, and tools for data science are sought. 
 DP Track. | Data privacy track.  Privacy-preserving data mining, privacy enhancing technologies, and statistical disclosure control provide tools to avoid disclosure, and/or have a good balance between disclosure risk and data utility and security. Original contributions on aspects related to data privacy are sought. 
 AGOP Track. | Aggregation functions.  Functions to aggregate data appear in several contexts. They are used for decision making and information fusion. Data science and artificial intelligence systems need these functions to summarize information, improve data quality and help in decision processes. Original contributions on aggregation functions and their applications are sought. 
 DM Track. | Human decision making.  Decision making is a pervasive problem in intelligent systems, and decisions are to be made in scenarios where uncertainty is common. Most mathematical models for decision making under risk and uncertainty provide optimal decisions under certain constraints. Experience and studies show that these rational decision making models diverge from the typical approach human use to make decisions. 
 GSN Track. | Graphs and (social) networks track.  Graphs are often a convenient way to represent data. Social networks is a paradigmatic case. Algorithms and functions to process graphs and to extract information and knowledge from them are of high relevance in data science. Original contributions on graph analysis are sought. 
 Sec Track. | Security track.  The more data-driven systems are used, the more the security aspects of these systems need to be take into account. Not only that, security in general becomes a key issue in all kind of computer systems. Original contributions in the field of information security, with special emphasis on AI-related systems, are sought. 
 Publication: | Proceedings will be published in the LNAI/LNCS series (Springer-Verlag), and distributed at the conference.  
  Besides, papers, that according to the evaluation of the referees, are not suitable for the LNAI but that have some merits will be published in accompanying proceedings and scheduled in the MDAI program. Papers can be directly submitted for the accompanying proceedings. |

 Call for papers   
 The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications.  
   
  MobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand, the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.  
   
  MobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments, especially in settings that is not easy for most in the community to duplicate (e.g., due to scale). MobiCom 2025 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 as described below in more detail.

  Two Deadlines, Early Notification, and One-shot Revision  
  
  MobiCom 2025 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews.  
   
  Final decisions will be one of the following  
  
  Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted. 
  Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom. 
  One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. 
   
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers  
 The authors of accepted MobiCom 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here.  
   
  Submission Instructions  
  
  All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom 2025 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. Experience submissions should prefix ‘Experience Paper:’ to their title. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers.  
   
  Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed.  . You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked.  
   
  Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:  
   
  Contain no more than | twelve (12) | single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Submissions may include appendices (following bibliography references) and they will not count towards the 12 pages. However, reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is self-contained. 
  Font size no smaller than | 10 points | . 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). 
  Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. 
  Authors' names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDFfile must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. 
  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these templates  useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}  . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify (manually or through the above online paper checker) that your submission is format-compliant.  

  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
   
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  

  Submission Policy  
  
  In addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are ​expected to make sure that their paper complies with the following submission policies.  
   
  Previous Publications  
 We allow submissions that extend a previous work published as a poster, demo, or workshop paper such as HotMobile or HotNets. However, in such case, the author(s) should (1) acknowledge their own previous workshop publication with an anonymous citation (e.g., "[7] Anonymized workshop paper") and (b) explain the differences between the MobiCom submission and the prior workshop paper (e.g. "This paper extends a prior workshop paper [7] and differs in the following aspects ..."). In addition, the online submission form will require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper. The PC will review such extended versions of previously-published workshop papers in accordance with the ACM Plagiarism Policy.  
   
  No Simultaneous Submissions  
 All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy ( ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous Submissions  ) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected  from all conferences/journals involved.  
   
  The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publications or submissions.  
   
   Double-blind Submissions  
 All submissions will be evaluated through double-blind reviewing. Please do not violate this requirement by explicitly or implicitly leaking the identity of any co-author or institution. They include but not limited to the below requirements: Please be sure your name and affiliation do not appear on the paper or in the submitted PDF file. This means that before submission, you must remove from the paper the authors' names, authors' affiliations, acknowledgments of funding sources, etc. 
  Please be cautious and careful how you refer to your own prior work in the paper. For example, do not describe your prior work with phrases like: | “In prior work[3], we presented a routing protocol that …” | Instead, refer to your work in the third person, such as | “In prior work, Smith[3] presented a routing protocol that …” | With this method, the full citation to Smith can still be given, such as | [3] Smith, J., "Analysis of … " | In particular, it is not acceptable to say | [3] Reference deleted for double-blind review. 
  Experience submissions should also be anonymous and not include the name of the authors and their affiliations. However, they may reveal the name of the deploying organization. 
  Please avoid advertising the paper with the same or similar title on your webpage, social media, or through large mailing lists. Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. The link in the paper, however, must be anonymized. Reviewers are not obliged to review such supplementary materials and such links must not be used to provide additional text that does not fit within the 12-page limit of the paper. 
  Authors are allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to MobiCom during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper on a preprint server before the MobiCom decisions are made, the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version. MobiCom strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media, personal web pages or in the press while under submission to MobiCom. Finally, any reviewer aware of the authorship of a specific submission, may not be allowed to review the paper, at the discretion of the PC chairs. 
  We will not review any paper that violates our double-blind policy.  
   
  Submissions will be kept confidential until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.  
   
   Conflict of Interest (CoI)  
 For a fair review process, program committee members who are COIs to any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion and decision-making of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark COIs in the submission website.  
   
  We generally follow the ACM policy ( Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  ) and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define COIs of one submission at MobiCom ’25 as:  
  (1) any PC member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months  or reasonably expected within the next 12 months  ;  
  (2) any PC member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (3) any PC member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (4) any PC member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author;  
  (5) any PC member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;  
  (6) any PC member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);  
  (7) any PC member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;  
  (8) others perceivable conflicts.  
   
  A potential COI must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
   
  The author(s) must identify every COI out of all PC members (including chairs) with any  author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
   
  Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated COI, and knowingly and falsely asserting a COI — e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another — are both considered as a violation of this COI policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews.  
   
   Previous Submissions  
 In case of any similarity between a current submission and a submission that has been previously rejected at MobiCom or other relevant conferences within the last 12 months, the authors are requested to do the following in three cases: For a one-shot revision, please carefully follow the instructions on the notification. Along with the resubmission, the authors must report the major concerns and requested items from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the revision. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been recently rejected by MobiCom, it is | required | for the authors to do the same as in case 1. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been previously rejected by a conference other than MobiCom (such as Mobisys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, SenSys, UbiComp, etc.), it is | strongly encouraged | , although not required, for the authors to do the same items as in case 2. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure your anonymity is retained in this summary. 
   
   Processes for Conditionally Accepted Papers  
  
  Anonymous and Rigorous Shepherding   
  Conditionally accepted papers will be shepherded through a review process by a TPC member. Based on the feedback written in the reviews, authors of shepherded papers will submit a revision of their paper to the shepherd. The shepherd will collaborate with the reviewers from TPC to review the revised paper and provide the authors with additional comments. Note that the shepherding process could last 4-6 weeks and the authors might be asked to produce new experimental results and/or add new material. When the shepherding process results in final acceptance, the authors will upload their camera-ready file to the submissions system.  
   
  Video Presentation   
  The authors of each accepted paper will be asked to submit a one-minute video to introduce the research presented in their paper to the general public. These videos will be placed on the conference website and conference YouTube channel up to two weeks before the conference. A selected set will be featured by the social media channels related to the conference.  
   
  Registration and Presentation   
  By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present it.  

  Awards  
  
  All accepted regular  papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award  .

 Call for papers   
 The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications.  
   
  MobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand, the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.  
   
  MobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments, especially in settings that is not easy for most in the community to duplicate (e.g., due to scale). MobiCom 2025 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 as described below in more detail.

  Two Deadlines, Early Notification, and One-shot Revision  
  
  MobiCom 2025 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews.  
   
  Final decisions will be one of the following  
  
  Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted. 
  Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom. 
  One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. 
   
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers  
 The authors of accepted MobiCom 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here.  
   
  Submission Instructions  
  
  All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom 2025 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. Experience submissions should prefix ‘Experience Paper:’ to their title. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers.  
   
  Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed.  . You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked.  
   
  Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:  
   
  Contain no more than | twelve (12) | single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Submissions may include appendices (following bibliography references) and they will not count towards the 12 pages. However, reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is self-contained. 
  Font size no smaller than | 10 points | . 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). 
  Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. 
  Authors' names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDFfile must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. 
  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these templates  useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}  . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify (manually or through the above online paper checker) that your submission is format-compliant.  

  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
   
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  

  Submission Policy  
  
  In addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are ​expected to make sure that their paper complies with the following submission policies.  
   
  Previous Publications  
 We allow submissions that extend a previous work published as a poster, demo, or workshop paper such as HotMobile or HotNets. However, in such case, the author(s) should (1) acknowledge their own previous workshop publication with an anonymous citation (e.g., "[7] Anonymized workshop paper") and (b) explain the differences between the MobiCom submission and the prior workshop paper (e.g. "This paper extends a prior workshop paper [7] and differs in the following aspects ..."). In addition, the online submission form will require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper. The PC will review such extended versions of previously-published workshop papers in accordance with the ACM Plagiarism Policy.  
   
  No Simultaneous Submissions  
 All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy ( ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous Submissions  ) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected  from all conferences/journals involved.  
   
  The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publications or submissions.  
   
   Double-blind Submissions  
 All submissions will be evaluated through double-blind reviewing. Please do not violate this requirement by explicitly or implicitly leaking the identity of any co-author or institution. They include but not limited to the below requirements: Please be sure your name and affiliation do not appear on the paper or in the submitted PDF file. This means that before submission, you must remove from the paper the authors' names, authors' affiliations, acknowledgments of funding sources, etc. 
  Please be cautious and careful how you refer to your own prior work in the paper. For example, do not describe your prior work with phrases like: | “In prior work[3], we presented a routing protocol that …” | Instead, refer to your work in the third person, such as | “In prior work, Smith[3] presented a routing protocol that …” | With this method, the full citation to Smith can still be given, such as | [3] Smith, J., "Analysis of … " | In particular, it is not acceptable to say | [3] Reference deleted for double-blind review. 
  Experience submissions should also be anonymous and not include the name of the authors and their affiliations. However, they may reveal the name of the deploying organization. 
  Please avoid advertising the paper with the same or similar title on your webpage, social media, or through large mailing lists. Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. The link in the paper, however, must be anonymized. Reviewers are not obliged to review such supplementary materials and such links must not be used to provide additional text that does not fit within the 12-page limit of the paper. 
  Authors are allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to MobiCom during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper on a preprint server before the MobiCom decisions are made, the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version. MobiCom strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media, personal web pages or in the press while under submission to MobiCom. Finally, any reviewer aware of the authorship of a specific submission, may not be allowed to review the paper, at the discretion of the PC chairs. 
  We will not review any paper that violates our double-blind policy.  
   
  Submissions will be kept confidential until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.  
   
   Conflict of Interest (CoI)  
 For a fair review process, program committee members who are COIs to any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion and decision-making of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark COIs in the submission website.  
   
  We generally follow the ACM policy ( Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  ) and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define COIs of one submission at MobiCom ’25 as:  
  (1) any PC member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months  or reasonably expected within the next 12 months  ;  
  (2) any PC member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (3) any PC member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (4) any PC member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author;  
  (5) any PC member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;  
  (6) any PC member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);  
  (7) any PC member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;  
  (8) others perceivable conflicts.  
   
  A potential COI must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
   
  The author(s) must identify every COI out of all PC members (including chairs) with any  author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
   
  Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated COI, and knowingly and falsely asserting a COI — e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another — are both considered as a violation of this COI policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews.  
   
   Previous Submissions  
 In case of any similarity between a current submission and a submission that has been previously rejected at MobiCom or other relevant conferences within the last 12 months, the authors are requested to do the following in three cases: For a one-shot revision, please carefully follow the instructions on the notification. Along with the resubmission, the authors must report the major concerns and requested items from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the revision. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been recently rejected by MobiCom, it is | required | for the authors to do the same as in case 1. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been previously rejected by a conference other than MobiCom (such as Mobisys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, SenSys, UbiComp, etc.), it is | strongly encouraged | , although not required, for the authors to do the same items as in case 2. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure your anonymity is retained in this summary. 
   
   Processes for Conditionally Accepted Papers  
  
  Anonymous and Rigorous Shepherding   
  Conditionally accepted papers will be shepherded through a review process by a TPC member. Based on the feedback written in the reviews, authors of shepherded papers will submit a revision of their paper to the shepherd. The shepherd will collaborate with the reviewers from TPC to review the revised paper and provide the authors with additional comments. Note that the shepherding process could last 4-6 weeks and the authors might be asked to produce new experimental results and/or add new material. When the shepherding process results in final acceptance, the authors will upload their camera-ready file to the submissions system.  
   
  Video Presentation   
  The authors of each accepted paper will be asked to submit a one-minute video to introduce the research presented in their paper to the general public. These videos will be placed on the conference website and conference YouTube channel up to two weeks before the conference. A selected set will be featured by the social media channels related to the conference.  
   
  Registration and Presentation   
  By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present it.  

  Awards  
  
  All accepted regular  papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award  .

  Two Deadlines, Early Notification, and One-shot Revision  
  
  MobiCom 2025 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews.  
   
  Final decisions will be one of the following  
  
  Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted. 
  Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom. 
  One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. 
   
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers  
 The authors of accepted MobiCom 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here.  
   
  Submission Instructions  
  
  All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom 2025 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. Experience submissions should prefix ‘Experience Paper:’ to their title. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers.  
   
  Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed.  . You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked.  
   
  Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:  
   
  Contain no more than | twelve (12) | single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Submissions may include appendices (following bibliography references) and they will not count towards the 12 pages. However, reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is self-contained. 
  Font size no smaller than | 10 points | . 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). 
  Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. 
  Authors' names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDFfile must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. 
  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these templates  useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}  . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify (manually or through the above online paper checker) that your submission is format-compliant.  

  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
   
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  

  Submission Policy  
  
  In addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are ​expected to make sure that their paper complies with the following submission policies.  
   
  Previous Publications  
 We allow submissions that extend a previous work published as a poster, demo, or workshop paper such as HotMobile or HotNets. However, in such case, the author(s) should (1) acknowledge their own previous workshop publication with an anonymous citation (e.g., "[7] Anonymized workshop paper") and (b) explain the differences between the MobiCom submission and the prior workshop paper (e.g. "This paper extends a prior workshop paper [7] and differs in the following aspects ..."). In addition, the online submission form will require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper. The PC will review such extended versions of previously-published workshop papers in accordance with the ACM Plagiarism Policy.  
   
  No Simultaneous Submissions  
 All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy ( ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous Submissions  ) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected  from all conferences/journals involved.  
   
  The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publications or submissions.  
   
   Double-blind Submissions  
 All submissions will be evaluated through double-blind reviewing. Please do not violate this requirement by explicitly or implicitly leaking the identity of any co-author or institution. They include but not limited to the below requirements: Please be sure your name and affiliation do not appear on the paper or in the submitted PDF file. This means that before submission, you must remove from the paper the authors' names, authors' affiliations, acknowledgments of funding sources, etc. 
  Please be cautious and careful how you refer to your own prior work in the paper. For example, do not describe your prior work with phrases like: | “In prior work[3], we presented a routing protocol that …” | Instead, refer to your work in the third person, such as | “In prior work, Smith[3] presented a routing protocol that …” | With this method, the full citation to Smith can still be given, such as | [3] Smith, J., "Analysis of … " | In particular, it is not acceptable to say | [3] Reference deleted for double-blind review. 
  Experience submissions should also be anonymous and not include the name of the authors and their affiliations. However, they may reveal the name of the deploying organization. 
  Please avoid advertising the paper with the same or similar title on your webpage, social media, or through large mailing lists. Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. The link in the paper, however, must be anonymized. Reviewers are not obliged to review such supplementary materials and such links must not be used to provide additional text that does not fit within the 12-page limit of the paper. 
  Authors are allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to MobiCom during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper on a preprint server before the MobiCom decisions are made, the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version. MobiCom strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media, personal web pages or in the press while under submission to MobiCom. Finally, any reviewer aware of the authorship of a specific submission, may not be allowed to review the paper, at the discretion of the PC chairs. 
  We will not review any paper that violates our double-blind policy.  
   
  Submissions will be kept confidential until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.  
   
   Conflict of Interest (CoI)  
 For a fair review process, program committee members who are COIs to any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion and decision-making of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark COIs in the submission website.  
   
  We generally follow the ACM policy ( Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  ) and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define COIs of one submission at MobiCom ’25 as:  
  (1) any PC member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months  or reasonably expected within the next 12 months  ;  
  (2) any PC member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (3) any PC member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (4) any PC member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author;  
  (5) any PC member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;  
  (6) any PC member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);  
  (7) any PC member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;  
  (8) others perceivable conflicts.  
   
  A potential COI must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
   
  The author(s) must identify every COI out of all PC members (including chairs) with any  author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
   
  Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated COI, and knowingly and falsely asserting a COI — e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another — are both considered as a violation of this COI policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews.  
   
   Previous Submissions  
 In case of any similarity between a current submission and a submission that has been previously rejected at MobiCom or other relevant conferences within the last 12 months, the authors are requested to do the following in three cases: For a one-shot revision, please carefully follow the instructions on the notification. Along with the resubmission, the authors must report the major concerns and requested items from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the revision. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been recently rejected by MobiCom, it is | required | for the authors to do the same as in case 1. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been previously rejected by a conference other than MobiCom (such as Mobisys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, SenSys, UbiComp, etc.), it is | strongly encouraged | , although not required, for the authors to do the same items as in case 2. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure your anonymity is retained in this summary. 
   
   Processes for Conditionally Accepted Papers  
  
  Anonymous and Rigorous Shepherding   
  Conditionally accepted papers will be shepherded through a review process by a TPC member. Based on the feedback written in the reviews, authors of shepherded papers will submit a revision of their paper to the shepherd. The shepherd will collaborate with the reviewers from TPC to review the revised paper and provide the authors with additional comments. Note that the shepherding process could last 4-6 weeks and the authors might be asked to produce new experimental results and/or add new material. When the shepherding process results in final acceptance, the authors will upload their camera-ready file to the submissions system.  
   
  Video Presentation   
  The authors of each accepted paper will be asked to submit a one-minute video to introduce the research presented in their paper to the general public. These videos will be placed on the conference website and conference YouTube channel up to two weeks before the conference. A selected set will be featured by the social media channels related to the conference.  
   
  Registration and Presentation   
  By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present it.  

  Awards  
  
  All accepted regular  papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award  .

  Call For Papers   
   
 The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications. MobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand, the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. MobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments. MobiCom 2025 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 as described below in more detail. Topics We invite submissions on a wide range of mobile computing, mobile systems, mobile applications, and wireless networking research, including but not limited to the following: Edge and cloud computing Embedded and energy-harvesting systems Backscatter communication and wireless power Implantable and wearable computing Millimeter-wave and terahertz communications Mobile health Applications of machine learning (on-device ML, federated/decentralized ML) to mobile/wireless research Transfer learning and domain adaptation for mobile applications Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI for mobile and wireless systems Next generation of mobile networks (5G, 6G and beyond) Mobile web, video, virtual reality, augmented reality and other applications Novel applications of wireless signals Practical quantum applications and systems (quantum sensing, quantum programming, quantum machine learning, etc.) Vehicular, robotic and drone-based networking Communication with reconfigurable and intelligent reflective surfaces, meta materials, and flexible surfaces Satellite networks and integrated satellite-terrestrial networks Security and privacy issues/solutions for mobile/wireless systems Sensing with radio, light, sound, and acoustics Smart cities and smart spaces (e.g. smart factories, smart workspace, smart agriculture, urban mobility) Ubiquitous computing and mobile human-computer interaction Underwater networking and sensing Visible light communications Wireless localization and tracking Reducing carbon footprint of wireless networks and mobile devices  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-08-07

 【这是2015年的CFP】 ACM MobiHoc is a premier conference with a highly selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from wireless networking and computing. We invite paper submissions on fundamental contributions to a broad variety of issues related to wireless and mobile networks. We encourage theoretical contributions as well as submissions related to implementation and experimentation that provide deeper understanding. The main focus is on contributions at and above the MAC layer. Papers dealing with physical layer issues are also welcome, provided that they address cross-layer networking issues. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following: Mobile, cellular, sensor, wireless mesh, vehicular, cognitive radio, ad hoc, social, opportunistic, and delay tolerant networks Optimization and control for mobile crowdsourcing Mobile computing systems Applications, middleware, transport, network, and MAC protocols Routing, scheduling, resource allocation, and energy efficiency Localization and location privacy Scaling laws and fundamental limits Cross-layer optimization and control Modeling and performance evaluation Function computation and data aggregation Network resilience, fault-tolerance, and reliability Trust, security, and privacy Distributed sensing, actuation, and control in cyber-physical systems Wireless aspects of the smart grid Wireless aspects of the Internet of Things Impacts of physical layer innovations on higher layers System design, testbeds, and experimental evaluation Measurements from deployed and experimental systems All papers submitted to the conference will be considered for a Best Paper Award.

 Introduction  : Conceived in early 1995, ACM SIGMOBILE started as an organization that fosters research in the field of mobility and tetherless ubiquitous connectivity. In early 1997, we had 21 members and were a relatively unknown organization. Since then, we have grown both in size and stature, with members who span the entire world. Our members work in academia, industry, and government. They are students, teachers, practioners, policy makers, and scientists. Our organization boasts one of the most remarkable retention rates among all ACM SIGs.  
  
 The single identifying characteristic of our members is that we are a very passionate bunch. We believe we are changing the world, and we are. Our interests range from building commercially viable handheld devices with powerful communications and computing ability, to lightweight wearables that are part of a soldier's battle gear, connecting him to the rest of his platoon or division. We are interested in providing computing and Internet access in automobiles, trains, ships, planes, and spacecraft. We build satellites that connect to each other and to the Internet. We work on problems related to connectivity and functionality of millions of sensors, which we believe will become pervasive. We are interested in personal and body-area networks. Most of all, we are interested in enabling the reliable flows of useful bits in the air, the computing power in your hand, and anywhere and anytime ubiquitous communications.

 ACM MobiHoc is a premier conference with a highly selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability. Examples of such dynamic networks include wired/wireless communication, datacenters, Internet-of-Things and sensors, mobile autonomous systems, energy, social, and transportation networks. We encourage work that presents new performance evaluation methods, novel algorithms, or provides fundamental insights for these systems.  
 We are interested both in innovative works in an unexplored and/or emerging topic in the broad area of networks, and in novel findings and/or new insights that build on existing works. The specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Internet-of-Things (IoT), 5G, and next-generation wireless systems 
  Blockchain, social networks, societal networks, and emerging networked systems 
  Cloud computing, edge computing, and distributed computing over networks 
  Software Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization, and virtual Radio Access Networks 
  Information-centric networking, network caching, and coded caching 
  Trust, security, and privacy in networks and networked systems 
  Coded computation and inference in networks 
  Incentive mechanism and interaction analysis of networked systems, network economics 
  Big-data analytics, machine learning for networks and networked systems, and network support to machine learning 
  Modeling, analysis, optimization, and control in computer and mobile networks 
  Networked and mobile unmanned/autonomous systems 
  Experimental studies on mobile networks and networked systems 
  Networked sensing and communication with new medium, e.g., light/acoustic/mmWave 
  Low power sensor protocols and energy-harvesting systems 
  Wearables and mobile health

 Abstract Submission | January 30, 2025 
 Paper Submission | February 6, 2025 
 Revise and Resubmit Notifications | March 13, 2025 
 Revised Submission | May 8, 2025 
 Final Notifications | May 29, 2025 
 Camera-ready | June 19, 2025 

 Preparing the Submission  
 Novelty  
 The submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal. Out-of-scope papers will be desk rejected.  
 Length  
 Typical page length is 4000 and 9000 words (excluding references and appendix), but any page length is allowed as long as the paper contribution is commensurate. If the paper is more than 12,000 words, we may reject it if no justification is provided. References and the appendix do not count toward the paper length. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its length, so papers with a length disproportionate to their contribution will likely be rejected. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed appropriately. The abstract has to be a paragraph of 150 words or less.  
 Formatting  
 Papers must be in English  .  
 Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template. Submission preparation is described on the ACM Primary Template website  .  
 For LaTex, the correct templates (Overleaf or LaTeX templates) can be found on ACM’s Preparing your article for LaTeX  page, using \documentclass[manuscript, screen, review]{acmart}.  
 For Word, the correct submission template can be found on ACM’s Preparing your article for Word  page, i.e., “submission template.”  
 The TAPS workflow we use is described on ACM’s TAPS workflow page  .  
 All references must be complete, accurate, accessible, and conform to the ACM Publication Format.  
 Anonymity  
 All submissions need to be fully anonymized. This includes any appendices or supplemental material as well as a potential acknowledgments section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymized. This allows reviewers to ensure all previous research has been taken into account. However authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person. For example, "Smith et al. [1] did ... " instead of "We did ... [1]". Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected.  
 Supplementary Materials  
 All videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Videos can be of any length and should include closed captions and audio descriptions; see Accessible Presentation Guide  . Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help others replicate the work. Authors should submit any non-video supplementary material as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main PDF submission. That is, the paper submission must stand independently without the supplementary material.  
 Accessibility  
 Authors are required to follow SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission  . If authors have questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs via diversity2025@mobilehci.acm.org  early in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will be reassigned. Note that while we strive to match the best reviewer to each paper – the best reviewers for the work may not be able to review an inaccessible submission.

  Use of Generative AI  
 Authors must adhere to the ACM Policy on Authorship  regarding the use of generative AI in submissions. Authors are responsible for all content produced (including plagiarism, misrepresentation, or fabrication) by these tools and must disclose their use.  
 ACM Publications Policy  
 By submitting an article to an ACM Publication, authors acknowledge that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  
 ACM will investigate alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy. They may result in a full retraction of the paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 All authors are required to have an ORCID  .  
 Submitting  
 Submission Platform  
 Submissions are facilitated via the Precision Conference System (PCS)  . Authors may submit and edit their materials until the submission deadline. Should authors encounter any difficulties, technical problems, or questions about this process, please contact the Workshops Chairs via papers2025@mobilehci.acm.org  .  
 In PCS, first click "Submissions" at the top of the page. From the "Society" dropdown menu, select "SIGCHI." Then, from the "Conference/journal" dropdown menu, select "MobileHCI 2025." Finally, from the "Track" dropdown menu, select the "MobileHCI 2025 workshops" option. After selecting all three dropdown options, press “Go.” In the table below, authors will see a new entry for MobileHCI with an “Edit submission” option; press this and enter all the required details.  
 Metadata Integrity  
 Changes in author names  are not allowed  after the submission deadline; there are no exceptions  . Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline. The metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process and author representation  . If any of the authors needs to be added or removed after the submission deadline, authors would need to withdraw their submissions/papers.  Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the revision period.  
 Selection Process  
 We use a refereed process  , i.e., an editorial board and a set of external reviewers will review the submitted papers. The editorial board members will make decisions for any submitted papers as either accepted, minor revisions, major revisions, or rejected. These notifications will be sent to the corresponding authors. If the initial decision is "minor revisions" or "major revision," the paper authors will have time for the revision cycle to address the required changes. After resubmission, the final decision on the revised papers will be sent to the authors. Please note that for "major revision" submissions, the external reviewers may check all the required changes. Reviewing will be conducted in a double-anonymous fashion, i.e., reviewers and authors are anonymous to each other.  
 Upon Acceptance  
 Publication  
 The paper publication is archival, i.e., accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part of the Proceedings of ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACMHCI). ACM will send authors a copyright form which they have to complete. Once completed, authors will be provided with the ACM copyright information which authors of accepted papers are required to sign and put on their papers. Authors are required to submit their camera-ready version through the submission system and process it according to the publication instructions  .  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library  . This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference.  
 Presentation Format  
 Upon acceptance, we will invite authors to present their papers at the conference.  
 Conference Registration  
 For each accepted paper, at least one author must register for the MobileHCI 2025 conference by the early bird registration deadline.  
 Demo  
 The Demo Chairs might invite authors of accepted papers to participate in the demo session. For this, authors have to submit an additional document describing the technical requirements for the demo.

 Call for papers   
 The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications.  
   
  MobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand, the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.  
   
  MobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments, especially in settings that is not easy for most in the community to duplicate (e.g., due to scale). MobiCom 2025 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 as described below in more detail.

  Two Deadlines, Early Notification, and One-shot Revision  
  
  MobiCom 2025 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews.  
   
  Final decisions will be one of the following  
  
  Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted. 
  Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom. 
  One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. 
   
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers  
 The authors of accepted MobiCom 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here.  
   
  Submission Instructions  
  
  All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom 2025 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. Experience submissions should prefix ‘Experience Paper:’ to their title. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers.  
   
  Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed.  . You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked.  
   
  Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:  
   
  Contain no more than | twelve (12) | single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Submissions may include appendices (following bibliography references) and they will not count towards the 12 pages. However, reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is self-contained. 
  Font size no smaller than | 10 points | . 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). 
  Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. 
  Authors' names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDFfile must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. 
  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these templates  useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}  . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify (manually or through the above online paper checker) that your submission is format-compliant.  

  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
   
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  

  Submission Policy  
  
  In addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are ​expected to make sure that their paper complies with the following submission policies.  
   
  Previous Publications  
 We allow submissions that extend a previous work published as a poster, demo, or workshop paper such as HotMobile or HotNets. However, in such case, the author(s) should (1) acknowledge their own previous workshop publication with an anonymous citation (e.g., "[7] Anonymized workshop paper") and (b) explain the differences between the MobiCom submission and the prior workshop paper (e.g. "This paper extends a prior workshop paper [7] and differs in the following aspects ..."). In addition, the online submission form will require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper. The PC will review such extended versions of previously-published workshop papers in accordance with the ACM Plagiarism Policy.  
   
  No Simultaneous Submissions  
 All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy ( ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous Submissions  ) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected  from all conferences/journals involved.  
   
  The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publications or submissions.  
   
   Double-blind Submissions  
 All submissions will be evaluated through double-blind reviewing. Please do not violate this requirement by explicitly or implicitly leaking the identity of any co-author or institution. They include but not limited to the below requirements: Please be sure your name and affiliation do not appear on the paper or in the submitted PDF file. This means that before submission, you must remove from the paper the authors' names, authors' affiliations, acknowledgments of funding sources, etc. 
  Please be cautious and careful how you refer to your own prior work in the paper. For example, do not describe your prior work with phrases like: | “In prior work[3], we presented a routing protocol that …” | Instead, refer to your work in the third person, such as | “In prior work, Smith[3] presented a routing protocol that …” | With this method, the full citation to Smith can still be given, such as | [3] Smith, J., "Analysis of … " | In particular, it is not acceptable to say | [3] Reference deleted for double-blind review. 
  Experience submissions should also be anonymous and not include the name of the authors and their affiliations. However, they may reveal the name of the deploying organization. 
  Please avoid advertising the paper with the same or similar title on your webpage, social media, or through large mailing lists. Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. The link in the paper, however, must be anonymized. Reviewers are not obliged to review such supplementary materials and such links must not be used to provide additional text that does not fit within the 12-page limit of the paper. 
  Authors are allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to MobiCom during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper on a preprint server before the MobiCom decisions are made, the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version. MobiCom strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media, personal web pages or in the press while under submission to MobiCom. Finally, any reviewer aware of the authorship of a specific submission, may not be allowed to review the paper, at the discretion of the PC chairs. 
  We will not review any paper that violates our double-blind policy.  
   
  Submissions will be kept confidential until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.  
   
   Conflict of Interest (CoI)  
 For a fair review process, program committee members who are COIs to any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion and decision-making of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark COIs in the submission website.  
   
  We generally follow the ACM policy ( Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  ) and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define COIs of one submission at MobiCom ’25 as:  
  (1) any PC member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months  or reasonably expected within the next 12 months  ;  
  (2) any PC member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (3) any PC member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (4) any PC member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author;  
  (5) any PC member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;  
  (6) any PC member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);  
  (7) any PC member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;  
  (8) others perceivable conflicts.  
   
  A potential COI must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
   
  The author(s) must identify every COI out of all PC members (including chairs) with any  author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
   
  Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated COI, and knowingly and falsely asserting a COI — e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another — are both considered as a violation of this COI policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews.  
   
   Previous Submissions  
 In case of any similarity between a current submission and a submission that has been previously rejected at MobiCom or other relevant conferences within the last 12 months, the authors are requested to do the following in three cases: For a one-shot revision, please carefully follow the instructions on the notification. Along with the resubmission, the authors must report the major concerns and requested items from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the revision. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been recently rejected by MobiCom, it is | required | for the authors to do the same as in case 1. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been previously rejected by a conference other than MobiCom (such as Mobisys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, SenSys, UbiComp, etc.), it is | strongly encouraged | , although not required, for the authors to do the same items as in case 2. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure your anonymity is retained in this summary. 
   
   Processes for Conditionally Accepted Papers  
  
  Anonymous and Rigorous Shepherding   
  Conditionally accepted papers will be shepherded through a review process by a TPC member. Based on the feedback written in the reviews, authors of shepherded papers will submit a revision of their paper to the shepherd. The shepherd will collaborate with the reviewers from TPC to review the revised paper and provide the authors with additional comments. Note that the shepherding process could last 4-6 weeks and the authors might be asked to produce new experimental results and/or add new material. When the shepherding process results in final acceptance, the authors will upload their camera-ready file to the submissions system.  
   
  Video Presentation   
  The authors of each accepted paper will be asked to submit a one-minute video to introduce the research presented in their paper to the general public. These videos will be placed on the conference website and conference YouTube channel up to two weeks before the conference. A selected set will be featured by the social media channels related to the conference.  
   
  Registration and Presentation   
  By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present it.  

  Awards  
  
  All accepted regular  papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award  .

 Preparing the Submission  
 Novelty  
 The submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal. Out-of-scope papers will be desk rejected.  
 Length  
 Typical page length is 4000 and 9000 words (excluding references and appendix), but any page length is allowed as long as the paper contribution is commensurate. If the paper is more than 12,000 words, we may reject it if no justification is provided. References and the appendix do not count toward the paper length. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its length, so papers with a length disproportionate to their contribution will likely be rejected. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed appropriately. The abstract has to be a paragraph of 150 words or less.  
 Formatting  
 Papers must be in English  .  
 Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template. Submission preparation is described on the ACM Primary Template website  .  
 For LaTex, the correct templates (Overleaf or LaTeX templates) can be found on ACM’s Preparing your article for LaTeX  page, using \documentclass[manuscript, screen, review]{acmart}.  
 For Word, the correct submission template can be found on ACM’s Preparing your article for Word  page, i.e., “submission template.”  
 The TAPS workflow we use is described on ACM’s TAPS workflow page  .  
 All references must be complete, accurate, accessible, and conform to the ACM Publication Format.  
 Anonymity  
 All submissions need to be fully anonymized. This includes any appendices or supplemental material as well as a potential acknowledgments section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymized. This allows reviewers to ensure all previous research has been taken into account. However authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person. For example, "Smith et al. [1] did ... " instead of "We did ... [1]". Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected.  
 Supplementary Materials  
 All videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Videos can be of any length and should include closed captions and audio descriptions; see Accessible Presentation Guide  . Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help others replicate the work. Authors should submit any non-video supplementary material as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main PDF submission. That is, the paper submission must stand independently without the supplementary material.  
 Accessibility  
 Authors are required to follow SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission  . If authors have questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs via diversity2025@mobilehci.acm.org  early in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will be reassigned. Note that while we strive to match the best reviewer to each paper – the best reviewers for the work may not be able to review an inaccessible submission.

  Adding Document Tags 
  PDF Accessibility Checker 
  Use of Generative AI  
 Authors must adhere to the ACM Policy on Authorship  regarding the use of generative AI in submissions. Authors are responsible for all content produced (including plagiarism, misrepresentation, or fabrication) by these tools and must disclose their use.  
 ACM Publications Policy  
 By submitting an article to an ACM Publication, authors acknowledge that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  
 ACM will investigate alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy. They may result in a full retraction of the paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 All authors are required to have an ORCID  .  
 Submitting  
 Submission Platform  
 Submissions are facilitated via the Precision Conference System (PCS)  . Authors may submit and edit their materials until the submission deadline. Should authors encounter any difficulties, technical problems, or questions about this process, please contact the Workshops Chairs via papers2025@mobilehci.acm.org  .  
 In PCS, first click "Submissions" at the top of the page. From the "Society" dropdown menu, select "SIGCHI." Then, from the "Conference/journal" dropdown menu, select "MobileHCI 2025." Finally, from the "Track" dropdown menu, select the "MobileHCI 2025 workshops" option. After selecting all three dropdown options, press “Go.” In the table below, authors will see a new entry for MobileHCI with an “Edit submission” option; press this and enter all the required details.  
 Metadata Integrity  
 Changes in author names  are not allowed  after the submission deadline; there are no exceptions  . Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline. The metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process and author representation  . If any of the authors needs to be added or removed after the submission deadline, authors would need to withdraw their submissions/papers.  Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the revision period.  
 Selection Process  
 We use a refereed process  , i.e., an editorial board and a set of external reviewers will review the submitted papers. The editorial board members will make decisions for any submitted papers as either accepted, minor revisions, major revisions, or rejected. These notifications will be sent to the corresponding authors. If the initial decision is "minor revisions" or "major revision," the paper authors will have time for the revision cycle to address the required changes. After resubmission, the final decision on the revised papers will be sent to the authors. Please note that for "major revision" submissions, the external reviewers may check all the required changes. Reviewing will be conducted in a double-anonymous fashion, i.e., reviewers and authors are anonymous to each other.  
 Upon Acceptance  
 Publication  
 The paper publication is archival, i.e., accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part of the Proceedings of ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACMHCI). ACM will send authors a copyright form which they have to complete. Once completed, authors will be provided with the ACM copyright information which authors of accepted papers are required to sign and put on their papers. Authors are required to submit their camera-ready version through the submission system and process it according to the publication instructions  .  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library  . This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference.  
 Presentation Format  
 Upon acceptance, we will invite authors to present their papers at the conference.  
 Conference Registration  
 For each accepted paper, at least one author must register for the MobileHCI 2025 conference by the early bird registration deadline.  
 Demo  
 The Demo Chairs might invite authors of accepted papers to participate in the demo session. For this, authors have to submit an additional document describing the technical requirements for the demo.

 Preparing the Submission  
 Novelty  
 The submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal. Out-of-scope papers will be desk rejected.  
 Length  
 Typical page length is 4000 and 9000 words (excluding references and appendix), but any page length is allowed as long as the paper contribution is commensurate. If the paper is more than 12,000 words, we may reject it if no justification is provided. References and the appendix do not count toward the paper length. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its length, so papers with a length disproportionate to their contribution will likely be rejected. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed appropriately. The abstract has to be a paragraph of 150 words or less.  
 Formatting  
 Papers must be in English  .  
 Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template. Submission preparation is described on the ACM Primary Template website  .  
 For LaTex, the correct templates (Overleaf or LaTeX templates) can be found on ACM’s Preparing your article for LaTeX  page, using \documentclass[manuscript, screen, review]{acmart}.  
 For Word, the correct submission template can be found on ACM’s Preparing your article for Word  page, i.e., “submission template.”  
 The TAPS workflow we use is described on ACM’s TAPS workflow page  .  
 All references must be complete, accurate, accessible, and conform to the ACM Publication Format.  
 Anonymity  
 All submissions need to be fully anonymized. This includes any appendices or supplemental material as well as a potential acknowledgments section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymized. This allows reviewers to ensure all previous research has been taken into account. However authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person. For example, "Smith et al. [1] did ... " instead of "We did ... [1]". Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected.  
 Supplementary Materials  
 All videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Videos can be of any length and should include closed captions and audio descriptions; see Accessible Presentation Guide  . Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help others replicate the work. Authors should submit any non-video supplementary material as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main PDF submission. That is, the paper submission must stand independently without the supplementary material.  
 Accessibility  
 Authors are required to follow SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission  . If authors have questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs via diversity2025@mobilehci.acm.org  early in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will be reassigned. Note that while we strive to match the best reviewer to each paper – the best reviewers for the work may not be able to review an inaccessible submission.

  Use of Generative AI  
 Authors must adhere to the ACM Policy on Authorship  regarding the use of generative AI in submissions. Authors are responsible for all content produced (including plagiarism, misrepresentation, or fabrication) by these tools and must disclose their use.  
 ACM Publications Policy  
 By submitting an article to an ACM Publication, authors acknowledge that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  
 ACM will investigate alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy. They may result in a full retraction of the paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 All authors are required to have an ORCID  .  
 Submitting  
 Submission Platform  
 Submissions are facilitated via the Precision Conference System (PCS)  . Authors may submit and edit their materials until the submission deadline. Should authors encounter any difficulties, technical problems, or questions about this process, please contact the Workshops Chairs via papers2025@mobilehci.acm.org  .  
 In PCS, first click "Submissions" at the top of the page. From the "Society" dropdown menu, select "SIGCHI." Then, from the "Conference/journal" dropdown menu, select "MobileHCI 2025." Finally, from the "Track" dropdown menu, select the "MobileHCI 2025 workshops" option. After selecting all three dropdown options, press “Go.” In the table below, authors will see a new entry for MobileHCI with an “Edit submission” option; press this and enter all the required details.  
 Metadata Integrity  
 Changes in author names  are not allowed  after the submission deadline; there are no exceptions  . Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline. The metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process and author representation  . If any of the authors needs to be added or removed after the submission deadline, authors would need to withdraw their submissions/papers.  Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the revision period.  
 Selection Process  
 We use a refereed process  , i.e., an editorial board and a set of external reviewers will review the submitted papers. The editorial board members will make decisions for any submitted papers as either accepted, minor revisions, major revisions, or rejected. These notifications will be sent to the corresponding authors. If the initial decision is "minor revisions" or "major revision," the paper authors will have time for the revision cycle to address the required changes. After resubmission, the final decision on the revised papers will be sent to the authors. Please note that for "major revision" submissions, the external reviewers may check all the required changes. Reviewing will be conducted in a double-anonymous fashion, i.e., reviewers and authors are anonymous to each other.  
 Upon Acceptance  
 Publication  
 The paper publication is archival, i.e., accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part of the Proceedings of ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACMHCI). ACM will send authors a copyright form which they have to complete. Once completed, authors will be provided with the ACM copyright information which authors of accepted papers are required to sign and put on their papers. Authors are required to submit their camera-ready version through the submission system and process it according to the publication instructions  .  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library  . This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference.  
 Presentation Format  
 Upon acceptance, we will invite authors to present their papers at the conference.  
 Conference Registration  
 For each accepted paper, at least one author must register for the MobileHCI 2025 conference by the early bird registration deadline.  
 Demo  
 The Demo Chairs might invite authors of accepted papers to participate in the demo session. For this, authors have to submit an additional document describing the technical requirements for the demo.

 Call for Workshops   
 Are you exploring an exciting and emerging area in MobileHCI? Consider organizing a workshop! Organizing a workshop is a great opportunity to move the field forward and build a community around emerging topics.  
 Workshops are independently organized full-day or half-day events that take place on the day before the main MobileHCI conference. Workshops allow researchers, practitioners, and students to meet in the context of a focused and interactive discussion and, thus, build a community. MobileHCI workshops might address various topics within mobile contexts, including but not limited to:  
 Basic and applied research 
  Innovative AI technologies and their impact on mobile interactions 
  MobileHCI practice 
  New methods 
  Emerging application areas 
  Design innovations 
  HCI education 
  Ethical considerations and privacy in MobileHCI 
  Each workshop should offer a new, organised way of thinking about topics or suggest promising future research directions for the MobileHCI community. Following the conference theme " Diving into Mobile AI  ", we strongly encourage workshop organisers to consider submissions reflecting, in part or entirely, on the aspects of the theme.

 Submission of Proposals | March 15, 2025 
 Acceptance Notification | March 29, 2025 
 Camera-ready | August 8, 2025 

 Preparing the Submission  
 Workshop proposals should include:  
 Background: Provide a strong rationale for the workshop, describe the issues to be addressed, and state concrete goals for the workshop. If this is a continuation of a previously offered workshop, please provide precise descriptions of how you are extending the goals of the workshop or any changes you are introducing. 
  Pre-Workshop plans: State your plans for recruiting and community-building (e.g., through a website or other communication with participants) and plans for accessibility and inclusion leading up to the workshop. 
  Workshop format (In-person): Please provide details about the workshop, including the technical capacity necessary to support the workshop day. We encourage organizers to support asynchronous online materials for participants unable to access in-person or synchronous virtual space, mainly for reasons of a pandemic or visa issues. Please include accessibility requirements such as transcription, if needed. 
  Workshop schedule: Please provide a proposed schedule of activities for the workshop. MobileHCI workshops typically have 15 - 20 participants, and interaction is fundamental. The proposed workshop schedule can be modified by the organizers prior to the actual event and according to the number of submissions and participants. However, workshop schedules are an important factor in the selection process. Your proposed schedule must clearly identify the workshop as either a half-day or a full-day workshop, and it should provide details regarding planned forms of engagement (keynotes, presentations, discussions, group, and individual activities), as well as the use of breaks. 
  Diversity and language: Please elaborate on how you plan to promote diversity and create an inclusive environment at the workshop. Submissions should actively consider a respectful use of language, especially in relation to marginalized groups. 
  Expected outcomes: Discuss the expected outcomes of the proposed workshop. For instance, some workshops result in edited books or special issues of journals. 
  Organisers: Include short bios for the organizers and indicate who is the main contact person and how participants can reach them. 
  Length  
 Submissions should be a maximum of 6 pages long (excluding references).  
 Formatting  
 Papers must be in English  . Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template. Submission preparation is described on the ACM Primary Template website  .  
 For LaTex, the correct templates (Overleaf or LaTeX templates) can be found on ACM’s Preparing your article for LaTeX  page, using \documentclass[manuscript, screen, review]{acmart}.

 Criteria for selection will consider three things:  
 Is the workshop topic relevant to the MobileHCI and the broader HCI community? 
  Does the topic of the workshop have the potential to evoke interest from the MobileHCI community? This may include considerations for whether the workshop topic is new, thought-provoking, and/or pushing forward the knowledge related to an emerging topic of interest in the community. 
  Does the workshop foster community-building and diversity in the MobileHCI community? 
  Upon Acceptance  
 Publication  
 Accepted workshop proposals will be included in the ACM Digital Library as part of the MobileHCI 2025 Adjunct Proceedings.  
 ACM will send authors a copyright form, which they have to complete. Once completed, authors will be provided with the ACM copyright information, which authors of accepted papers are required to sign and put on their papers. Authors are required to submit their camera-ready version through the submission system and process it according to the publication instructions  .  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library  . This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference.

  Inform MobileHCI Web Chairs:Provide a title, short description, and website URL to the conference Web Chairs so your workshop can be listed on the main website. 
  Advertise your workshop:Share your call for participants within your professional network. If you'd like the workshop to be promoted through the main conference social network accounts, please inform the conference Publicity and Social Media Chairs and provide them with the necessary text and media material. 
  Collect papers/presentations: Workshops typically include paper presentations from participants (depending on how the organizers run the workshop). Workshop papers can present novel technical contributions or take the form of a position paper. Paper length requirements are determined by the workshop organizers. Please note that workshop papers are not archived with the conference proceedings. Workshop organizers can decide how to archive submissions (e.g., a collection in CEUR proceedings or arXiv). 
  Set up a review process:Select papers/participants accordingly. We expect workshops to target a minimum number of 10 participants. Organizers can define specific dates as necessary to fulfill their selection process. We encourage workshops to complete the selection by mid-July 2025 to allow participants to plan accordingly for attending the conference. Suggested deadlines are available at the end of this page. 
  Distribute accepted papers/presentations and other pre-workshop materials to participants before the workshop: It will help participants to familiarize themselves with workshop content and encourage more in-depth discussions. 
  Publish: Decide on and publish the final program of workshop activities. 
  During the workshop, organizers facilitate discussion, maintain productive interaction, and encourage participation. The emphasis should be on group discussion rather than on the presentation of individual papers. Diversity of perspectives should be encouraged. 
  We recommend that accepted workshop organizers consider the following timeline guidelines in preparing their call for submissions to match the conference preparation schedule:  
 Deadline for submissions: | After the main paper notification date | (i.e. after May 30, 2025) 
  Notifications of acceptance: | At least 3 weeks after the submission deadline 
  Some workshops may choose to extend their submission deadline in order to attract more submissions. However we recommend that dates are adjusted so that final author notifications are sent at least 5 days prior to the conference early-bird registration deadlines.  
 We invite workshop organizers to contact the MobileHCI‘25 Workshop Chairs with any questions or requests for support.  
 Conference Registration  
 For each accepted workshop, a full registration for the MobileHCI 2025 conference is required by the early bird registration deadline.

 Call for Papers   
 The ACM International Conference on Mobile Human-Computer Interaction (MobileHCI) Conference Series has shaped research, development, and practice in services used on mobile or within mobile contexts for over two decades. We interpret mobility broadly and welcome contributions to any aspect of mobile HCI technology systems, devices, techniques, applications, experience, methods, tools, theories, models, and new perspectives. The MobileHCI full papers will be published as journal articles in a special issue in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction  (PACMHCI).  
 The MobileHCI conference seeks submissions targeted toward this year’s conference theme: “Diving into Mobile AI,” and topics in the following key domains:  
 Systems and Infrastructure: | The design, architecture, deployment, and evaluation of systems and infrastructures that support the development of or interaction with mobile technology. 
  Interaction Devices and Techniques: | The design, construction, usage, and evaluation of devices and techniques that create valuable new interactive capabilities for mobile human-computer interaction. 
  Applications and Experiences: | Descriptions of the design, empirical study of interactive applications, or analysis of usage trends that leverage mobile devices and systems. Application areas include health care, mobility, sustainability, social engagement, and civic engagement. 
  Methods and Tools: | New methods and tools designed for, or applied to, studying or building mobile user interfaces, applications, and mobile users. 
  Theories and Models: | Critical analysis or organizing theory with clearly motivated relevance to the design or study of mobile human-computer interaction; taxonomies of design or devices.

 Preparing the Submission  
 Novelty  
 The submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal. Out-of-scope papers will be desk rejected.  
 Length  
 Typical page length is 4000 and 9000 words (excluding references and appendix), but any page length is allowed as long as the paper contribution is commensurate. If the paper is more than 12,000 words, we may reject it if no justification is provided. References and the appendix do not count toward the paper length. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its length, so papers with a length disproportionate to their contribution will likely be rejected. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed appropriately. The abstract has to be a paragraph of 150 words or less.  
 Formatting  
 Papers must be in English  .  
 Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template. Submission preparation is described on the ACM Primary Template website  .  
 For LaTex, the correct templates (Overleaf or LaTeX templates) can be found on ACM’s Preparing your article for LaTeX  page, using \documentclass[manuscript, screen, review]{acmart}.  
 For Word, the correct submission template can be found on ACM’s Preparing your article for Word  page, i.e., “submission template.”  
 The TAPS workflow we use is described on ACM’s TAPS workflow page  .  
 All references must be complete, accurate, accessible, and conform to the ACM Publication Format.  
 Anonymity  
 All submissions need to be fully anonymized. This includes any appendices or supplemental material as well as a potential acknowledgments section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymized. This allows reviewers to ensure all previous research has been taken into account. However authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person. For example, "Smith et al. [1] did ... " instead of "We did ... [1]". Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected.  
 Supplementary Materials  
 All videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Videos can be of any length and should include closed captions and audio descriptions; see Accessible Presentation Guide  . Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help others replicate the work. Authors should submit any non-video supplementary material as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main PDF submission. That is, the paper submission must stand independently without the supplementary material.  
 Accessibility  
 Authors are required to follow SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission  . If authors have questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs via diversity2025@mobilehci.acm.org  early in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will be reassigned. Note that while we strive to match the best reviewer to each paper – the best reviewers for the work may not be able to review an inaccessible submission.

  Use of Generative AI  
 Authors must adhere to the ACM Policy on Authorship  regarding the use of generative AI in submissions. Authors are responsible for all content produced (including plagiarism, misrepresentation, or fabrication) by these tools and must disclose their use.  
 ACM Publications Policy  
 By submitting an article to an ACM Publication, authors acknowledge that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  
 ACM will investigate alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy. They may result in a full retraction of the paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 All authors are required to have an ORCID  .  
 Submitting  
 Submission Platform  
 Submissions are facilitated via the Precision Conference System (PCS)  . Authors may submit and edit their materials until the submission deadline. Should authors encounter any difficulties, technical problems, or questions about this process, please contact the Workshops Chairs via papers2025@mobilehci.acm.org  .  
 In PCS, first click "Submissions" at the top of the page. From the "Society" dropdown menu, select "SIGCHI." Then, from the "Conference/journal" dropdown menu, select "MobileHCI 2025." Finally, from the "Track" dropdown menu, select the "MobileHCI 2025 workshops" option. After selecting all three dropdown options, press “Go.” In the table below, authors will see a new entry for MobileHCI with an “Edit submission” option; press this and enter all the required details.  
 Metadata Integrity  
 Changes in author names  are not allowed  after the submission deadline; there are no exceptions  . Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline. The metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process and author representation  . If any of the authors needs to be added or removed after the submission deadline, authors would need to withdraw their submissions/papers.  Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the revision period.  
 Selection Process  
 We use a refereed process  , i.e., an editorial board and a set of external reviewers will review the submitted papers. The editorial board members will make decisions for any submitted papers as either accepted, minor revisions, major revisions, or rejected. These notifications will be sent to the corresponding authors. If the initial decision is "minor revisions" or "major revision," the paper authors will have time for the revision cycle to address the required changes. After resubmission, the final decision on the revised papers will be sent to the authors. Please note that for "major revision" submissions, the external reviewers may check all the required changes. Reviewing will be conducted in a double-anonymous fashion, i.e., reviewers and authors are anonymous to each other.  
 Upon Acceptance  
 Publication  
 The paper publication is archival, i.e., accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part of the Proceedings of ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACMHCI). ACM will send authors a copyright form which they have to complete. Once completed, authors will be provided with the ACM copyright information which authors of accepted papers are required to sign and put on their papers. Authors are required to submit their camera-ready version through the submission system and process it according to the publication instructions  .  
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library  . This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference.  
 Presentation Format  
 Upon acceptance, we will invite authors to present their papers at the conference.  
 Conference Registration  
 For each accepted paper, at least one author must register for the MobileHCI 2025 conference by the early bird registration deadline.  
 Demo  
 The Demo Chairs might invite authors of accepted papers to participate in the demo session. For this, authors have to submit an additional document describing the technical requirements for the demo.

 ABOUT THE CONFERENCE  
 21st EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services  
 Despite the considerable research effort in the area of Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing over the nearly two decades, and the maturity of some of its base technologies, many challenges persist. The goal of the twenty-first annual International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services (MobiQuitous 2024) is to provide a forum for presenting and discussing high-quality research in the field, involving international practitioners and researchers from diverse backgrounds. MobiQuitous 2024 will thus foster research collaboration through focused discussions, interaction and exchange of experiences that will designate future research efforts and directions. Areas addressed by the conference include systems, applications, social networks, middleware, networking, sensing, data management, data processing and services, all with special focus on mobile and ubiquitous computing.

   to MobiSPC 2023 that will be held in conjunction with  
   The 18th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC)   
  
 Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC) have evolved into an active area of research and development. This is due to the tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics, including wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, RFID technology, and the ubiquitous mobile phone. MobiSPC-2023 solicits papers that focus on the theory, systems, practices and challenges of providing users with a successful mobile or wireless experience. This includes how mobile computing changes how people pervasively use their computers, computing resources and applications, as well the systems, services and technology enabling those applications.  
 MobiSPC 2023 will provide a leading edge, scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the art research and developmental work in the broad areas of pervasive computing and communications. The MobiSPC-2023 will be held in conjunction with The 18th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC 2023).

 Important Dates  
  
 Abstract Registration | December 2nd, 2024 23:59 AoE 
 Paper Submission | December 9th, 2024 23:59 AoE 
 Early Rejection Notification | January 20, 2025 
 Rebuttal Period | February 13th-17th, 2025 
 Final Decision Notification | March 7th, 2025 

 Submission site:  https://mobisys25.hotcrp.com   
 Note that titles and abstracts submitted to register the paper by the abstract deadline, albeit not final, must be sufficiently informative, i.e. it must contain a meaningful title and a meaningful abstract of at least 100 words which will reasonably correspond to the final version of the title and the abstract. Abstracts and/or paper tiles such as “TBD”, “XXX”, “coming”, “abcabc” or similar will be desk rejected. There will be no deadline extensions to the dates listed above.  
 All authors of the paper must be declared at the time of paper submission. Changes to the authorship list can only be accepted by the program chairs only if substantial reasoning is provided that the list of authors should change.  
 Policy on Concurrent/Previous submissions  
 Papers whose contributions overlap with work currently under review elsewhere must not be submitted to ACM MobiSys 2025. Papers whose contributions overlap with an earlier published paper will be considered only if  
 the previous paper was published (not just accepted) at a workshop before the ACM MobiSys 2025 submission date and 
  it adds significant new contributions over the previous paper. Authors uncertain whether their submission meets these guidelines should contact the program chairs. Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy  not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved.  
 Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication. However, we encourage the authors to  
 Use different system names in the technical report and ACM MobiSys 2025 submission and 
  Avoid publicizing the technical report on social media or community blogs and webpages while it is under review by ACM MobiSys 2025. 
  Resubmission Policy [New to MobiSys'25]   
 If your submission was based on work that was previously peer-reviewed and rejected, you are encouraged to provide a short summary of the points raised by the reviewers of your previous submission and how you addressed them. This non-mandatory summary can be submitted to the submission system  and should not be part of the paper submission itself. We do not expect a full rebuttal addressing each point, but rather an indication to the reviewers of ACM MobiSys 2025 that you have taken the previous reviewers’ comments seriously and are not simply resubmitting the paper as it was to ACM MobiSys 2025. The summary you have provided will be visible to the reviewers after they submitted their review to avoid any bias against paper resubmissions.  
 Double-Blind Review Process  
 As in the case of previous ACM MobiSys editions, ACM MobiSys 2025 will use a double-blind review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only program committee chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.  
 Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. Papers may be conditionally accepted and shepherded by a member of the program committee, with final acceptance determined by consent of the shepherd.  
 Formatting Guidelines  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (PDF). We will not accept papers in any other format. Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be rejected without review:  
 Contain no more than twelve (12) single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Font size no smaller than 10 points. 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). 
  Again, submissions must be in PDF. Authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. 
  Authors’ names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. 
  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: please contact the Program Committee chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these | templates | useful in complying with the above requirements. For LaTex users, please use | \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart} | . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify that your submission is format-compliant. 
  Ethics Review Board Approval Requirement  
 As part of the submission process, authors of papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze non-public data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), will be asked to certify that their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., Institutional Review Board (IRB), Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) or similar approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Papers that will not adhere to this rule will be rejected.  
 Mandatory Registration  
 At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the ACM MobiSys 2025 conference (at a non-student rate) and present the paper in-person.  
 Artifact Evaluation and Paper Results Reproducibility  
 As in the case of previous two ACM MobiSys editions, the authors of accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will have the option to opt for an artifact evaluation. By doing so, they commit to providing the implementations, models, test suites, benchmarks, and data used to derive the results presented in the paper to the artifact evaluation committee. Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badgelink: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging  . The artifact evaluation will be conducted after paper acceptance decisions.  
 Irrespective of taking part in the artifact evaluation, we encourage all authors to do their best to provide enough information in the paper allowing non-authors to replicate results presented in the paper.  
 Early Rejection Notification and Rebuttal  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will have early rejection notifications and a rebuttal phase. The authors of the papers that do not advance to the second round of review will be notified of the rejection of their paper. This allows the authors to plan for another submission and not have to wait for the ACM MobiSys 2025 review process to come to an end. The papers that do advance to the second round of review will get a chance to submit a rebuttal after the second round comes to an end. In the rebuttal, the authors will be asked to respond to the questions raised by the reviewers.  
 We ask the authors to limit their responses to correcting factual errors in the reviews or responding to specific questions posed by the reviewers. Responses must not include new experiments or describe additional work completed since submission. To lower the amount of effort for both the authors and reviewers, ACM MobiSys 2025 limits the rebuttal to 500 words.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 To ensure a fair review process, PC members who have a conflict of interest with any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark conflict of interests in the submission website.  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will follow the ACM policy  and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define conflicts of interest of one submission as:  
 any program committee member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author; These include your BSc advisor(s), Msc advisor(s), PhD advisor(s) and/or postdoctoral host(s). 
  any program committee member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months; 
  any program committee member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations); 
  any program committee member who has family, marriage, blood or heritage relationships. 
  any program committee member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author; 
  others perceivable conflicts. 
  Cases that do not require conflict of interest notification include:  
 Reviewers that are working on the same topic as you. 
  Collaborations with the reviewers on program committees, open source projects, etc. 
  A potential conflict of interest must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
 The author(s) must identify every conflict of interest out of all program committee members (including chairs) with any author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
 Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated conflict of interest, and knowingly and falsely asserting a conflict of interest, e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another are both considered as a violation of this conflict of interest policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews. Please contact program committee chairs if you have any doubts regarding declaring conflicts of interest.  
 Pitch Video for Accepted Papers [New to MobiSys'25]   
 All accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will be asked to submit, together with a camera-ready version of their paper, a (approximately) 90 seconds video presenting their accepted project. The submitted video will be part of ACM MobiSys 2025 proceedings and added to the SIGMOBILE YouTube Channel.  
 Policy on the Use of Large Language Models [New to MobiSys'25]   
 Following other major conferences such as CHI 2025  , any text in submissions that is generated using large-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly identified by the authors in the submitted paper. This policy does not apply to using LLMs for editing/proof-reading the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. While we do not anticipate using tools at a large scale to identify LLM-generated text, we will thoroughly investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.

Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badgelink: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging  . The artifact evaluation will be conducted after paper acceptance decisions.  
 Irrespective of taking part in the artifact evaluation, we encourage all authors to do their best to provide enough information in the paper allowing non-authors to replicate results presented in the paper.  
 Early Rejection Notification and Rebuttal  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will have early rejection notifications and a rebuttal phase. The authors of the papers that do not advance to the second round of review will be notified of the rejection of their paper. This allows the authors to plan for another submission and not have to wait for the ACM MobiSys 2025 review process to come to an end. The papers that do advance to the second round of review will get a chance to submit a rebuttal after the second round comes to an end. In the rebuttal, the authors will be asked to respond to the questions raised by the reviewers.  
 We ask the authors to limit their responses to correcting factual errors in the reviews or responding to specific questions posed by the reviewers. Responses must not include new experiments or describe additional work completed since submission. To lower the amount of effort for both the authors and reviewers, ACM MobiSys 2025 limits the rebuttal to 500 words.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 To ensure a fair review process, PC members who have a conflict of interest with any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark conflict of interests in the submission website.  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will follow the ACM policy  and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define conflicts of interest of one submission as:  
 any program committee member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author; These include your BSc advisor(s), Msc advisor(s), PhD advisor(s) and/or postdoctoral host(s). 
  any program committee member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months; 
  any program committee member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations); 
  any program committee member who has family, marriage, blood or heritage relationships. 
  any program committee member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author; 
  others perceivable conflicts. 
  Cases that do not require conflict of interest notification include:  
 Reviewers that are working on the same topic as you. 
  Collaborations with the reviewers on program committees, open source projects, etc. 
  A potential conflict of interest must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
 The author(s) must identify every conflict of interest out of all program committee members (including chairs) with any author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
 Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated conflict of interest, and knowingly and falsely asserting a conflict of interest, e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another are both considered as a violation of this conflict of interest policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews. Please contact program committee chairs if you have any doubts regarding declaring conflicts of interest.  
 Pitch Video for Accepted Papers [New to MobiSys'25]   
 All accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will be asked to submit, together with a camera-ready version of their paper, a (approximately) 90 seconds video presenting their accepted project. The submitted video will be part of ACM MobiSys 2025 proceedings and added to the SIGMOBILE YouTube Channel.  
 Policy on the Use of Large Language Models [New to MobiSys'25]   
 Following other major conferences such as CHI 2025  , any text in submissions that is generated using large-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly identified by the authors in the submitted paper. This policy does not apply to using LLMs for editing/proof-reading the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. While we do not anticipate using tools at a large scale to identify LLM-generated text, we will thoroughly investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.

 Important Dates  
  
 Abstract Registration | December 2nd, 2024 23:59 AoE 
 Paper Submission | December 9th, 2024 23:59 AoE 
 Early Rejection Notification | January 20, 2025 
 Rebuttal Period | February 13th-17th, 2025 
 Final Decision Notification | March 7th, 2025 

 Submission site:  https://mobisys25.hotcrp.com   
 Note that titles and abstracts submitted to register the paper by the abstract deadline, albeit not final, must be sufficiently informative, i.e. it must contain a meaningful title and a meaningful abstract of at least 100 words which will reasonably correspond to the final version of the title and the abstract. Abstracts and/or paper tiles such as “TBD”, “XXX”, “coming”, “abcabc” or similar will be desk rejected. There will be no deadline extensions to the dates listed above.  
 All authors of the paper must be declared at the time of paper submission. Changes to the authorship list can only be accepted by the program chairs only if substantial reasoning is provided that the list of authors should change.  
 Policy on Concurrent/Previous submissions  
 Papers whose contributions overlap with work currently under review elsewhere must not be submitted to ACM MobiSys 2025. Papers whose contributions overlap with an earlier published paper will be considered only if  
 the previous paper was published (not just accepted) at a workshop before the ACM MobiSys 2025 submission date and 
  it adds significant new contributions over the previous paper. Authors uncertain whether their submission meets these guidelines should contact the program chairs. Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy  not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved.  
 Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication. However, we encourage the authors to  
 Use different system names in the technical report and ACM MobiSys 2025 submission and 
  Avoid publicizing the technical report on social media or community blogs and webpages while it is under review by ACM MobiSys 2025. 
  Resubmission Policy [New to MobiSys'25]   
 If your submission was based on work that was previously peer-reviewed and rejected, you are encouraged to provide a short summary of the points raised by the reviewers of your previous submission and how you addressed them. This non-mandatory summary can be submitted to the submission system  and should not be part of the paper submission itself. We do not expect a full rebuttal addressing each point, but rather an indication to the reviewers of ACM MobiSys 2025 that you have taken the previous reviewers’ comments seriously and are not simply resubmitting the paper as it was to ACM MobiSys 2025. The summary you have provided will be visible to the reviewers after they submitted their review to avoid any bias against paper resubmissions.  
 Double-Blind Review Process  
 As in the case of previous ACM MobiSys editions, ACM MobiSys 2025 will use a double-blind review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only program committee chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.  
 Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. Papers may be conditionally accepted and shepherded by a member of the program committee, with final acceptance determined by consent of the shepherd.  
 Formatting Guidelines  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (PDF). We will not accept papers in any other format. Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be rejected without review:  
 Contain no more than twelve (12) single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Font size no smaller than 10 points. 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). 
  Again, submissions must be in PDF. Authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. 
  Authors’ names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. 
  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: please contact the Program Committee chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these | templates | useful in complying with the above requirements. For LaTex users, please use | \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart} | . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify that your submission is format-compliant. 
  Ethics Review Board Approval Requirement  
 As part of the submission process, authors of papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze non-public data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), will be asked to certify that their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., Institutional Review Board (IRB), Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) or similar approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Papers that will not adhere to this rule will be rejected.  
 Mandatory Registration  
 At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the ACM MobiSys 2025 conference (at a non-student rate) and present the paper in-person.  
 Artifact Evaluation and Paper Results Reproducibility  
 As in the case of previous two ACM MobiSys editions, the authors of accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will have the option to opt for an artifact evaluation. By doing so, they commit to providing the implementations, models, test suites, benchmarks, and data used to derive the results presented in the paper to the artifact evaluation committee. Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badgelink: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging  . The artifact evaluation will be conducted after paper acceptance decisions.  
 Irrespective of taking part in the artifact evaluation, we encourage all authors to do their best to provide enough information in the paper allowing non-authors to replicate results presented in the paper.  
 Early Rejection Notification and Rebuttal  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will have early rejection notifications and a rebuttal phase.

This allows the authors to plan for another submission and not have to wait for the ACM MobiSys 2025 review process to come to an end. The papers that do advance to the second round of review will get a chance to submit a rebuttal after the second round comes to an end.

Responses must not include new experiments or describe additional work completed since submission. To lower the amount of effort for both the authors and reviewers, ACM MobiSys 2025 limits the rebuttal to 500 words.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 To ensure a fair review process, PC members who have a conflict of interest with any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark conflict of interests in the submission website.  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will follow the ACM policy  and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define conflicts of interest of one submission as:

  any program committee member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author; These include your BSc advisor(s), Msc advisor(s), PhD advisor(s) and/or postdoctoral host(s).

  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: please contact the Program Committee chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these | templates | useful in complying with the above requirements. For LaTex users, please use | \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart} | . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify that your submission is format-compliant. 
  Ethics Review Board Approval Requirement  
 As part of the submission process, authors of papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze non-public data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), will be asked to certify that their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., Institutional Review Board (IRB), Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) or similar approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Papers that will not adhere to this rule will be rejected.  
 Mandatory Registration  
 At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the ACM MobiSys 2025 conference (at a non-student rate) and present the paper in-person.  
 Artifact Evaluation and Paper Results Reproducibility  
 As in the case of previous two ACM MobiSys editions, the authors of accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will have the option to opt for an artifact evaluation. By doing so, they commit to providing the implementations, models, test suites, benchmarks, and data used to derive the results presented in the paper to the artifact evaluation committee. Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badgelink: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging  . The artifact evaluation will be conducted after paper acceptance decisions.  
 Irrespective of taking part in the artifact evaluation, we encourage all authors to do their best to provide enough information in the paper allowing non-authors to replicate results presented in the paper.  
 Early Rejection Notification and Rebuttal  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will have early rejection notifications and a rebuttal phase. The authors of the papers that do not advance to the second round of review will be notified of the rejection of their paper. This allows the authors to plan for another submission and not have to wait for the ACM MobiSys 2025 review process to come to an end. The papers that do advance to the second round of review will get a chance to submit a rebuttal after the second round comes to an end. In the rebuttal, the authors will be asked to respond to the questions raised by the reviewers.  
 We ask the authors to limit their responses to correcting factual errors in the reviews or responding to specific questions posed by the reviewers. Responses must not include new experiments or describe additional work completed since submission. To lower the amount of effort for both the authors and reviewers, ACM MobiSys 2025 limits the rebuttal to 500 words.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 To ensure a fair review process, PC members who have a conflict of interest with any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark conflict of interests in the submission website.  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will follow the ACM policy  and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define conflicts of interest of one submission as:  
 any program committee member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author; These include your BSc advisor(s), Msc advisor(s), PhD advisor(s) and/or postdoctoral host(s). 
  any program committee member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months; 
  any program committee member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations); 
  any program committee member who has family, marriage, blood or heritage relationships. 
  any program committee member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author; 
  others perceivable conflicts. 
  Cases that do not require conflict of interest notification include:  
 Reviewers that are working on the same topic as you. 
  Collaborations with the reviewers on program committees, open source projects, etc. 
  A potential conflict of interest must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
 The author(s) must identify every conflict of interest out of all program committee members (including chairs) with any author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
 Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated conflict of interest, and knowingly and falsely asserting a conflict of interest, e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another are both considered as a violation of this conflict of interest policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews. Please contact program committee chairs if you have any doubts regarding declaring conflicts of interest.  
 Pitch Video for Accepted Papers [New to MobiSys'25]   
 All accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will be asked to submit, together with a camera-ready version of their paper, a (approximately) 90 seconds video presenting their accepted project. The submitted video will be part of ACM MobiSys 2025 proceedings and added to the SIGMOBILE YouTube Channel.  
 Policy on the Use of Large Language Models [New to MobiSys'25]   
 Following other major conferences such as CHI 2025  , any text in submissions that is generated using large-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly identified by the authors in the submitted paper. This policy does not apply to using LLMs for editing/proof-reading the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. While we do not anticipate using tools at a large scale to identify LLM-generated text, we will thoroughly investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.

 INFORMATION: Flooding in Austria  
 As you may have heard from the news, Austria was affected by the current flooding. Linz (including all venues and hotels) and the Vienna International Airport are fine.  
   
  Current Train Schedule from Vienna Airport   
  The current information is that public transport services between Vienna International Airport and Linz are operational, although the train schedule is changed. In addition, there is one train per hour from Vienna Main Station (Hauptbahnhof) and one train per hour from Westbahnhof to Linz. The services operate between 5am to 9pm (roughly), however, there are even later ones - please check the situation directly at the airport train station. Detailed information can be found on the following website:  
  https://www.oebb.at/en/neuigkeiten/unwetterwarnung   
   
  Cancelled Trains   
  Note, that many train connections were officially cancelled. (You might have received an e-mail notification about this). The ÖBB Scotty App also shows the information about all cancelled trains. This is because the replacement connections are (officially) different trains and might carry a new/alternative train number  .  
  Your ticket remains valid though!  Please get on an alternative train that will take you to Linz (direction "Salzburg").  
   
  Travelling from Germany (via Passau)   
  If you are traveling from Germany, please also note that ICE trains are currently not operated between Passau and Linz, but there is an alternative route using a (direct) local train.  
   
  Feel free to contact us, if you have any questions regarding your travel to MODELS 2024.

 Important Dates  
  
 Abstract Registration | December 2nd, 2024 23:59 AoE 
 Paper Submission | December 9th, 2024 23:59 AoE 
 Early Rejection Notification | January 20, 2025 
 Rebuttal Period | February 13th-17th, 2025 
 Final Decision Notification | March 7th, 2025 

 Submission site:  https://mobisys25.hotcrp.com   
 Note that titles and abstracts submitted to register the paper by the abstract deadline, albeit not final, must be sufficiently informative, i.e. it must contain a meaningful title and a meaningful abstract of at least 100 words which will reasonably correspond to the final version of the title and the abstract. Abstracts and/or paper tiles such as “TBD”, “XXX”, “coming”, “abcabc” or similar will be desk rejected. There will be no deadline extensions to the dates listed above.  
 All authors of the paper must be declared at the time of paper submission. Changes to the authorship list can only be accepted by the program chairs only if substantial reasoning is provided that the list of authors should change.  
 Policy on Concurrent/Previous submissions  
 Papers whose contributions overlap with work currently under review elsewhere must not be submitted to ACM MobiSys 2025. Papers whose contributions overlap with an earlier published paper will be considered only if  
 the previous paper was published (not just accepted) at a workshop before the ACM MobiSys 2025 submission date and 
  it adds significant new contributions over the previous paper. Authors uncertain whether their submission meets these guidelines should contact the program chairs. Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy  not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved.  
 Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication. However, we encourage the authors to  
 Use different system names in the technical report and ACM MobiSys 2025 submission and 
  Avoid publicizing the technical report on social media or community blogs and webpages while it is under review by ACM MobiSys 2025. 
  Resubmission Policy [New to MobiSys'25]   
 If your submission was based on work that was previously peer-reviewed and rejected, you are encouraged to provide a short summary of the points raised by the reviewers of your previous submission and how you addressed them. This non-mandatory summary can be submitted to the submission system  and should not be part of the paper submission itself. We do not expect a full rebuttal addressing each point, but rather an indication to the reviewers of ACM MobiSys 2025 that you have taken the previous reviewers’ comments seriously and are not simply resubmitting the paper as it was to ACM MobiSys 2025. The summary you have provided will be visible to the reviewers after they submitted their review to avoid any bias against paper resubmissions.  
 Double-Blind Review Process  
 As in the case of previous ACM MobiSys editions, ACM MobiSys 2025 will use a double-blind review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only program committee chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.  
 Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. Papers may be conditionally accepted and shepherded by a member of the program committee, with final acceptance determined by consent of the shepherd.  
 Formatting Guidelines  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (PDF). We will not accept papers in any other format. Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be rejected without review:  
 Contain no more than twelve (12) single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Font size no smaller than 10 points. 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). 
  Again, submissions must be in PDF. Authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. 
  Authors’ names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. 
  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: please contact the Program Committee chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these | templates | useful in complying with the above requirements. For LaTex users, please use | \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart} | . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify that your submission is format-compliant. 
  Ethics Review Board Approval Requirement  
 As part of the submission process, authors of papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze non-public data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), will be asked to certify that their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., Institutional Review Board (IRB), Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) or similar approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Papers that will not adhere to this rule will be rejected.  
 Mandatory Registration  
 At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the ACM MobiSys 2025 conference (at a non-student rate) and present the paper in-person.  
 Artifact Evaluation and Paper Results Reproducibility  
 As in the case of previous two ACM MobiSys editions, the authors of accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will have the option to opt for an artifact evaluation. By doing so, they commit to providing the implementations, models, test suites, benchmarks, and data used to derive the results presented in the paper to the artifact evaluation committee. Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badgelink: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging  . The artifact evaluation will be conducted after paper acceptance decisions.  
 Irrespective of taking part in the artifact evaluation, we encourage all authors to do their best to provide enough information in the paper allowing non-authors to replicate results presented in the paper.  
 Early Rejection Notification and Rebuttal  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will have early rejection notifications and a rebuttal phase. The authors of the papers that do not advance to the second round of review will be notified of the rejection of their paper. This allows the authors to plan for another submission and not have to wait for the ACM MobiSys 2025 review process to come to an end. The papers that do advance to the second round of review will get a chance to submit a rebuttal after the second round comes to an end. In the rebuttal, the authors will be asked to respond to the questions raised by the reviewers.  
 We ask the authors to limit their responses to correcting factual errors in the reviews or responding to specific questions posed by the reviewers. Responses must not include new experiments or describe additional work completed since submission. To lower the amount of effort for both the authors and reviewers, ACM MobiSys 2025 limits the rebuttal to 500 words.  
 Conflict of Interest  
 To ensure a fair review process, PC members who have a conflict of interest with any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark conflict of interests in the submission website.  
 ACM MobiSys 2025 will follow the ACM policy  and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define conflicts of interest of one submission as:  
 any program committee member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; 
  any program committee member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author; These include your BSc advisor(s), Msc advisor(s), PhD advisor(s) and/or postdoctoral host(s). 
  any program committee member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months; 
  any program committee member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations); 
  any program committee member who has family, marriage, blood or heritage relationships. 
  any program committee member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author; 
  others perceivable conflicts. 
  Cases that do not require conflict of interest notification include:  
 Reviewers that are working on the same topic as you. 
  Collaborations with the reviewers on program committees, open source projects, etc. 
  A potential conflict of interest must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
 The author(s) must identify every conflict of interest out of all program committee members (including chairs) with any author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
 Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated conflict of interest, and knowingly and falsely asserting a conflict of interest, e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another are both considered as a violation of this conflict of interest policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews. Please contact program committee chairs if you have any doubts regarding declaring conflicts of interest.  
 Pitch Video for Accepted Papers [New to MobiSys'25]   
 All accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will be asked to submit, together with a camera-ready version of their paper, a (approximately) 90 seconds video presenting their accepted project. The submitted video will be part of ACM MobiSys 2025 proceedings and added to the SIGMOBILE YouTube Channel.  
 Policy on the Use of Large Language Models [New to MobiSys'25]   
 Following other major conferences such as CHI 2025  , any text in submissions that is generated using large-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly identified by the authors in the submitted paper. This policy does not apply to using LLMs for editing/proof-reading the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. While we do not anticipate using tools at a large scale to identify LLM-generated text, we will thoroughly investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.

 Introduction  
   
 IEEE MASS 2024 is a premier annual forum for sharing original, novel ideas in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and smart systems, defined broadly. As wireless ad-hoc networks continue to evolve and specialize into a number of application scenarios and environments, and sensor-based systems and technologies increasingly permeate our everyday life and become the inner fabric of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS), the unfolding of smart environments such as smart cities, smart farming, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing,to name a few, demand integrated solutions that can make intelligent use of both cloud and edge systems, while applying machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to handle their growing complexity and to leverage the vast amount of available data.

 Conference Venue  

 We are happy to announce that the 2024 edition of MOBIQUITOUS conference will take place at  

 Kristiania University College  

 Campus Oslo - Kvadraturen (Old Town)  

 Location   
 Høyskolen Kristiania  
 Kirkegata 23-25,  0159 Oslo, Norway  
 (new building – opposite Kirkegata 24)  
 Website   
 https://www.kristiania.no/en/   
 Contact   
 Office – [email protected]    
 or [email protected]    

 Getting here and around   
 The easiest way to reach Oslo from abroad is by plane. Oslo has two airports, where Oslo Gardermoen (OSL) is the main airport and the closest one with numerous departures of public transportation to the city center. Oslo Torp Sandefjord (TRF) is located 1.5 hours outside of Oslo by train or bus and is served by several low-cost airlines, although it has fewer daily departures to Oslo city center. You can also reach Oslo by train to Oslo Central Station or by overnight ferry from Copenhagen, Fredrikshavn, or Kiel.  
 Traveling in Oslo   
 The city is easily accessible on foot, and you can walk from one side of downtown to the other in approximately an hour. Kristiania’s campuses are located in central downtown, close to the Central Train Station (stops Oslo S and Jernbanetorget). Oslo’s public transportation system is well-developed, and you can reach almost anywhere by bus, tram, metro, train, or ferry boat. The transportation company is called Ruter  , and there is one app for purchasing tickets and planning your travels.

 Keynote Speakers  

 Radu Prodan   

 Title: Think Broader, Run Local: Towards Neuro-Symbolic AI at the Edge     
  
  Radu Prodan received the PhD degree from the Vienna University of Technology in 2004. He is a professor in distributed systems with the Institute of Information Technology, University of Klagenfurt, Austria. Previously, he was an associate professor with the University of Innsbruck, Austria. His research interests are performance optimization, and resource management tools for parallel and distributed systems. He participated in numerous projects and coordinated the European Union projects ARTICONF and Graph-Massivizer. He has co-authored more than 250 publications and received three IEEE best paper awards.  
 Abstract:   
 The presentation starts by reviewing the convergence of two historically disconnected AI branches: symbolic AI of explicit deductive reasoning owning mathematical rigor and interpretability, and connectionist AI of implicit inductive reasoning lacking readability and explainability.  
  Afterward, it makes a case of neuro-symbolic data processing in knowledge graph representation approached by the Graph-Massivizer Horizon Europe project and applied for anomaly prediction in data centers using graph neural networks. Machine learning-driven graph sampling algorithms support its training and inference on resource-constrained Edge devices. The presentation concludes with an outlook into future projects targeting Edge large language models fine-tuned and contextualized using symbolic knowledge representation for regulatory AI compliance, job market, and medicine.

 Abstract:   
 As prosumers become active participants and assume the role of important stakeholders in the energy ecosystem, the energy-edge landscape is anticipated to undergo a drastic transformation towards achieving the green transition. Energy Edge Intelligence will play a crucial role in facilitating active participation and contribution from local prosumers as key stakeholders- to enable the massive uptake of renewable power generation from the edge. The efficient use of renewable power generation at the edge and coordinating its massive uptake into the grid for seamless integration of this “new” capacity into the existing energy system- through different interfaces such as aggregators or in the form of microgrids- will essentially require more fine-grained data communication and analytics.

 The International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward.

 ACM/IEEE 8th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems  
  (formerly the UML series of conferences)  
 The new MoDELS series of conferences are devoted to the topic of model-driven engineering, covering both languages and systems used to create complex systems. These conferences are both an expansion and a re-direction of previous Unified Modeling Language (UML) conferences, and replace that series of conference for 2005 and beyond.  
 Model-driven system development has long been used in the development of complex hardware systems. It is becoming more prevalent in complex software or combined hardware and software systems development as methodologies and tools become available that can manipulate software models from very abstract concepts through refinement and testing. The MoDELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to model-driven approaches in the development of software-based systems.

 MODELSWARD 2020 will be held in conjunction with ICISSP 2020    and BIOSTEC 2020    .   
  Registration to MODELSWARD allows free access to the ICISSP and BIOSTEC conferences (as a non-speaker).  

 The purpose of the International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development, MODELSWARD 2020, is to provide a platform for researchers, engineers, academics as well as industrial professionals from all over the world to present their research results and development activities in using models and model driven engineering techniques for Software Development. Model-Driven Development (MDD) is an approach to the development of IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for analysis of these systems but also for their construction. MDD has emerged from modelling initiatives, most prominently the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) fostered by the Object Management Group (OMG). In the scope of MDA, a couple of technologies have been developed that became the cornerstones of MDD, like metamodelling and model transformations. MDD relies on languages for defining metamodels, like the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and Ecore (developed in the scope of the Eclipse Modelling Framework), and transformation specification languages like QVT and ATL.

 Keynote Speakers  

 Radu Prodan   

 Title: Think Broader, Run Local: Towards Neuro-Symbolic AI at the Edge     
  
  Radu Prodan received the PhD degree from the Vienna University of Technology in 2004. He is a professor in distributed systems with the Institute of Information Technology, University of Klagenfurt, Austria. Previously, he was an associate professor with the University of Innsbruck, Austria. His research interests are performance optimization, and resource management tools for parallel and distributed systems. He participated in numerous projects and coordinated the European Union projects ARTICONF and Graph-Massivizer. He has co-authored more than 250 publications and received three IEEE best paper awards.  
 Abstract:   
 The presentation starts by reviewing the convergence of two historically disconnected AI branches: symbolic AI of explicit deductive reasoning owning mathematical rigor and interpretability, and connectionist AI of implicit inductive reasoning lacking readability and explainability.  
  Afterward, it makes a case of neuro-symbolic data processing in knowledge graph representation approached by the Graph-Massivizer Horizon Europe project and applied for anomaly prediction in data centers using graph neural networks. Machine learning-driven graph sampling algorithms support its training and inference on resource-constrained Edge devices. The presentation concludes with an outlook into future projects targeting Edge large language models fine-tuned and contextualized using symbolic knowledge representation for regulatory AI compliance, job market, and medicine.  

 Sabita Maharjan   

 Title: Energy Edge Intelligence    
 Sabita Maharjan [SM’19] is a Full Professor at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway from September 2022.

  Professor Maharjan is a recipient of the IEEE TCGCC Outstanding Young Researcher Award 2020. She is the Highly Cited Researcher for 2021, 2022 and 2023 according to Web of Science- which is an accolade given in recognition of the exceptional research performance demonstrated by multiple highly cited papers that rank in the top 1% of citations for field and year- worldwide. Professor Maharjan’s has served as  
 – Vice Chair of the IEEE ComSoc Technical Committee on Green Communications and Computing (TCGCC) SIG on Green AI from (2020-2022), as  
  – Editor for IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking (IEEE TGCN)  
  – Associate Editor for the IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IoT-J)  
  – Associate Editor for the IEEE Open Computer Society Journal, and  
  – Guest Editor for top-tier journals such as IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (IEEE JSAC), IEEE Trans. on Green Communications and Networking (IEEE TGCN), IEEE Access.  
 Professor Maharjan was the Technical Program Committee Co-Chair of IEEE SmartGridComm 2024- held in Oslo Norway in Sept. 2024 and the Symposium Chair for the Green Communication Systems and Networks Symposium in the IEEE Globecom 2024- to be held in Capetown, South Africa in December 2024. In the past, she has contributed actively in the technical program committees of conferences including top conferences like IEEE INFOCOM and IEEE IWQoS. Her current research interests include vehicular networks, 5G Beyond and 6G, network security, smart grid, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence for networks.  
 Abstract:   
 As prosumers become active participants and assume the role of important stakeholders in the energy ecosystem, the energy-edge landscape is anticipated to undergo a drastic transformation towards achieving the green transition. Energy Edge Intelligence will play a crucial role in facilitating active participation and contribution from local prosumers as key stakeholders- to enable the massive uptake of renewable power generation from the edge. The efficient use of renewable power generation at the edge and coordinating its massive uptake into the grid for seamless integration of this “new” capacity into the existing energy system- through different interfaces such as aggregators or in the form of microgrids- will essentially require more fine-grained data communication and analytics.

 Investigating Choking Under Pressure in Dance Performance with Motion and Physiological Information Analysis  
  Abstract   
 This study is the initial phase in developing coping mechanisms for individuals who struggle with ‘choking under pressure’ due to stress. We focus on examining the motion and physiological information of dancers in high-pressure performance and low-pressure practice environments. Our primary objective is to identify key differences in stress responses between individuals who manage pressure well and those who do not. Through a comparative analysis of the motion and physiological information, we seek to identify the disparities between those who are adept at handling choking under pressure and those who are not. To simulate a high-pressure performance environment, a dance audition will be conducted and the physical and mental state of the auditionees during the evaluation process will be monitored and analyzed. The results indicated that auditionees who were unable to cope with choking under pressure showed significantly reduced physical movements compared to those who were able to handle it.

 A Method for Estimating the Force Applied on the Forearm Using PPG Sensors  
  Abstract   
 This study proposes estimating forearm pressure using a PPG sensor in a smartwatch or activity meter. The method involves creating a regression model that estimates the applied pressure by analyzing changes in the local maximum values of pulse waves before and after the pressure is applied. Experiments with five subjects evaluated the method. The individual evaluation model, using only the user’s data, had an average coefficient of determination of 0.57 and an MAE of 1.60 Kg. The total evaluation model, using all subjects’ data, had a coefficient of determination of 0.53 and an MAE of 1.97 Kg.

 Good Vibes! Towards Phone-to-User Authentication Through Wristwatch Vibrations  
  Abstract   
 While mobile devices frequently require users to authenticate to prevent unauthorized access, mobile devices typically do not authenticate to their users. This leaves room for users to unwittingly interact with different mobile devices. We present GoodVibes authentication, a variant of mobile device-to-user authentication, where the user’s phone authenticates to the user through their wristwatch vibrating in their pre-selected authentication vibration pattern. We implement GoodVibes authentication as an Android prototype, evaluate different authentication scenarios with 30 participants, and find users to be able to well recognize and distinguish their authentication vibration pattern from different patters, from unrelated vibrations, and from the pattern being absent.

 A Method for Embedding Information Into Acceleration Data Using Resonant Frequency Sound to Capacitive Accelerometers  
  Abstract   
 This paper presents a method to embed arbitrary bit sequences into acceleration data by attacking capacitive accelerometers with sound. Using a loudspeaker, sound data representing bit sequences is irradiated to the device, manipulating the acceleration data instantly and continuously. Evaluation experiments showed that the extraction accuracy of 10-bit binary information is 100% from multifunctional sensors placed on the table, 99.7% from a smartphone placed on the table, 100% from multifunctional sensors worn at the wrist, and 98% from a smartphone held in the hand.

 MEUSec – Method for Enhancing User Experience and Information Security  
  Abstract   
 Digital identity wallets enable the management of digital identities and verification documents such as ID cards and driving licences. This data can be stored efficiently in one place on user devices. Research shows that some of the existing digital identity wallets have user experience and information security deficits. Users struggle to understand the concept of digital identity wallets, personal information is often inadequately secured or released to untrusted parties. Moreover, user experience and information security might influence each other negatively. Hence, it is necessary to consider user experience and information security simultaneously, and to evaluate and improve them together. However, existing methods focus on either aspect and do not consider their interplay. In this paper, we present the MEUSec method to facilitate an analysis and improvement of user experience and information security of digital identity wallets.

 Correlation Between Gamification and Intrinsic Motivation with a Mobile Job-Market Application  
  Abstract   
 In this paper we study the influence of the degree a mobile app is gamified on the motivation of its users. In particular, we created three versions of the same job application app, one without gamification, one with modest gamification, and one with heavy gamification. We then asked 21 student participants about their motivation to use either of these versions. Statistical analysis shows that gamification indeed increases motivation, but there is no significant difference between modest and heavy gamification.

 Query by Trash: Encouraging Green Attitudes and Behavior Through Eco-News Retrieval in Smart Trash Bins  
  Abstract   
 This paper proposes a smart trash bin to promote pro-environmental attitudes and behavior. The proposed system automatically searches for and displays news articles that are relevant to the type of trash discarded. The device ranks news articles in consideration of both the discarded trash type and its potential to evoke a sense of environmental urgency or guilt. To achieve this ranking, we constructed a dataset of news articles annotated for their “crisis/guilt” sentiment and trained a ranking model using a learning-to-rank algorithm. The highest-ranked article is displayed on a screen installed in the device.   
 The results of a user study demonstrated that a prototype device presented an opportunity for participants to reflect on environmental issues and demonstrated a modest influence on the formation of pro-environmental attitudes.

 Mild Cognitive Impairment Prediction Using Facial and Speech Data  
  Abstract   
 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional stage between the cognitive decline associated with normal aging and more severe conditions such as dementia. Early diagnosis of MCI is crucial for effective healthcare intervention. However, current detection methods are often costly and time-consuming. This study introduces a multimodal fusion network (MFN) designed to predict MCI more efficiently. The proposed network utilizes dual-stream ResNets to process both facial and speech features. These features, extracted from the convolutional and subsampling layers of the ResNets, are subsequently fused in a fully connected layer to generate the final prediction. The dataset comprises a total of 52 participant videos, with an equal distribution: 26 videos from participants with normal cognitive function and 26 videos from participants diagnosed with MCI. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with an F1 score of 0.89 across test participants.

 Comparing Training of Sparse to Classic Neural Networks for Binary Classification in Medical Data  
  Abstract   
 Sparse Neural Networks are increasing in popularity and provide the opportunity for compact and efficient models for resource-constrained environments which are expanding as the number of IoT devices is increasing and as the Edge Computing and Fog paradigms are gaining traction. We investigate and evaluate sparsifying the training of Convolutional Neural Networks for the task of binary classification on medical datasets. We considered low ( i.e.  , \(28\times 28\)  ) grey-scale resolution images that are memory-friendly and suitable for storing and analysing on lightweight devices. We found out that high sparsification strategies (above 75%) can achieve comparable performances with that of the fully connected counterpart while allowing for a reduction in inference time and peak memory usage, beneficial for resource-constrained environments part of Edge Computing. It is important to note that, as might be expected, after 90% sparsity, the performance can oscillate, and the results can vary significantly.

 A Genetic Algorithm-Based Scheduling Method Considering Working Hours for Medical Doctors  
  Abstract   
 With the diversity of work styles in recent years, we need to solve issues such as the aging of the working-age population and the increasing responsibilities of caregiving. In particular, the medical field requires efficient and appropriate scheduling due to the lengthening of working hours caused by the shortage of human resources. Many researchers have addressed the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP). However, the scheduling problem for medical doctors is more difficult than NSP because they have more varied work arrangements and more stringent constraints than those of the NSP. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically generate work scheduling that considers the work hours of medical doctors. The proposed method classifies medical doctors into four types of work arrangements (morning shift, afternoon shift, semi-night shift, and night shift) and constructs rules to generate constraints for each work arrangement. In addition, the proposed method uses a genetic algorithm to generate the optimal work schedules for multiple medical doctors considering computer resources in heuristic search. The evaluation results showed that the proposed method can generate work schedules that satisfy as many contraints as possible.

 Application of Benford’s Law to the Identification of Non-authentic Digital Images  
  Abstract   
 This study evaluated Benford’s law for detecting non-authentic digital images by analyzing the first digits of pixel values after a discrete cosine transform (DCT). We analyzed 137 pairs of authentic and modified JPEGs using ROC curves, k-means clustering, chi-squared tests, and PCA. The results showed AUC values near 0.5, indicating low classification performance. The k-means algorithm had 49% precision with low completeness, and PCA revealed a significant overlap between the authentic and manipulated images. These findings suggest the limited effectiveness of Benford’s law alone, highlighting the need to integrate advanced image-processing methods and explore additional pixel-distribution features for the effective detection of non-authentic images.

 Efficient Moving Object Detection from Ultra-High Resolution Omnidirectional Video  
  Abstract   
 With advancements in panoramic camera technology, resolutions have significantly improved [ 1  ], capturing distant objects more clearly. The Insta360 Titan, for instance, supports up to 11k resolution ( \(10560\times 5280\)  ), offering unprecedented detail. However, current object recognition methods struggle with such ultra-high-resolution footage. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting moving objects in 11k panoramic videos from the Insta360 Titan. Our method involves downsampling and background subtraction to detect moving objects quickly and accurately. These regions are then cropped into smaller images for high-precision detection, reducing computational load. This technique, inspired by proxy methods in video editing, maintains result quality while easing processing burdens. Experiments demonstrate our method’s ability to accurately detect humans at distances up to 60 m, achieving 15 fps, thus proving its effectiveness for ultra-high-resolution panoramic footage.

 Evaluation of the Clustering Method Used to Analyze the Proximity of Mobile Devices Using Indirect Geolocation Indicators  
  Abstract   
 This study introduces a new methodology for clustering mobile devices to determine their geographical proximity without using direct geolocation data. Using the DBSCAN algorithm, we aim to identify significant spatial patterns while preserving user privacy. The dataset used includes information on device manufacturers and network interactions. Clustering was performed after data preprocessing, with DBSCAN effectively grouping devices in proximity. Our results show that this method successfully identifies clusters that reflect meaningful geographical relationships among the devices. The evaluation included calculating the average and maximum distances within the clusters, demonstrating the robustness of the method. Despite its effectiveness, the success of the method depends on the quality and completeness of the input data. Future research should explore additional data sources and refine used algorithms to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

 Cross-Project Software Defect Prediction Using Ensemble Model with Individual Data Balancing and Feature Selection  
  Abstract   
 The quality of software significantly influences its safety and security. With the rapid expansion of software development, the issue of coding quality has become increasingly critical. The manual and resource-intensive nature of error detection in software and its inherent unreliability underscores the necessity for automation. Consequently, a burgeoning interest is employing machine learning methods for software defect prediction. This study introduces a novel stacking software cross-project defect prediction model. Each weak classifier undergoes a learning process incorporating individual data balancing and feature selection techniques. The efficacy of the model was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score metrics on multiple project datasets sourced from the PROMISE repository. The application of the proposed model yielded a classification accuracy of 0.839 and an F1 score of 0.909, surpassing the average performance of single classifiers.

 AUTO-DataGenCARS+: An Advanced User-Oriented Tool to Generate Data for the Evaluation of Recommender Systems  
  Abstract   
 Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS) offer context-based suggestions that are particularly crucial in the tourism domain, where personalized experiences significantly enhance user satisfaction. However, the evaluation of CARS is a challenge, partly due to the scarce availability of appropriate datasets that fulfill a variety of evaluation purposes. For example, to evaluate CARS, we need datasets that incorporate context data, but in practice existing datasets provide very little contextual information.   
 This paper presents AUTO-DataGenCARS+, a graphical user-oriented tool designed to generate synthetic data for evaluating both Recommender Systems and CARS. Some of the relevant features of the tool include: a flexible definition of user profiles, user, item and context schemas; a realistic generation of ratings and item attributes; the possibility to mix real and synthetic datasets; functionalities for analyzing and evaluating existing datasets; and an extendable architecture for advanced users. We illustrate the benefits of AUTO-DataGenCARS+ through several examples and experimental evaluations.

 A Method for Eliminating False Positives of Acceleration-Based Gesture Recognition Using Eye Tracking  
  Abstract   
 This paper sets up a scenario where a monitor is operated through gestures and proposes a method that excludes false positives in gesture recognition using eye tracking data. A preliminary experiment confirmed that existing gesture recognition using acceleration data often misrecognizes relatively simple gestures like Circle and Check during activities involving significant movements, such as stretching and walking, compared with more complex gestures like Cross and Triangle. Additionally, eye tracking data were collected during daily activities. Analyzing these results, we hypothesized that a user’s gaze movements are small during intentional gestures aimed at operating a monitor. By calculating the standard deviation of various gaze features and excluding segments with abnormal values, we aimed to enhance the accuracy of gesture recognition. The results showed that features such as Fixation Movement Distance and Average Pupil Diameter Change are relatively effective in excluding false positives, particularly for simple gestures like Circle and Check.

 Toward the Implementation of a Cooking Support System Complementing Nonexistent Objects with Virtual Objects  
  Abstract   
 Cooking requires the usage of various ingredients and cooking utensils. However, if we lack some of them due to insufficient preparation, we cannot cook as expected. In this paper, we propose a cooking support system that complements nonexistent objects with virtual objects. We developed a prototype for cutting apples to evaluate the differences between using the real object and the virtual one. The results showed that the cutting technique equally enhanced both the cases of using a real knife and a virtual knife.

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.
