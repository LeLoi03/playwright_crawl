 Call For Papers  

 EUMAS 2024 welcomes original, unpublished papers including improved versions of extended abstracts or rejected papers from AAMAS, AAAI and IJCAI 2023. The submission should describe work that has not been previously published, accepted for publication nor is currently under review by another conference or journal.  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed in a single blind fashion. Submission length depends upon the track that you submit to. Additional pages may be used for references and, if needed, a clearly marked appendix. It should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS format. For templates and instructions for authors, see Conference proceedings guidelines    . Authors must submit their papers through the EUMAS 2024 Easychair submission site    as a single PDF file.  
 This year, EUMAS is accepting submissions across 4 tracks:  
 Main Track (15 pages + references) | Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Action and Planning Adaptation and Learning; Agent Architectures; Agent Programming Languages; Agent Development Methodologies and Tools; Agent-Based Simulations and Modeling; Agent Organizations and Institutions; Agent-oriented Software Engineering; Agents and Complex Systems; Applications of Multi-agent Systems; Argumentation; Automated negotiation; Biologically inspired approaches; Cognitive Models; Collective and Swarm Intelligence; Collective Intentionality; Communication Cooperation, and Coordination; Computational Social Choice; Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Agent Domains; Economic Models; Electronic Commerce; Ethical behavior of multi-agent systems; Formal Modelling; Game-Theoretic Methods; Human-Agent Interaction; Logics for Multi-Agent Systems; Logics for Strategic Reasoning; Machine Learning for Multi-Agent Systems; Multi-Agent Learning; Multi-Robot Systems; Negotiation; Self-organization; Semantic Web Agents; Social Networks; Socio-technical Systems; Theories of Agency; Trust and Reputation; Verification; Virtual Agents; Voting and Judgment Aggregation Models for Multi-Agent Systems 
  Agents and Ethics (15 pages + references) | This track is focussed on the implementation of ethical reasoning mechanisms in various autonomous decision-making settings. Depending on the context of the agent (software / hardware), the kinds of values (or value-conflicts) that are encountered could be quite varied. The multiplicity and agency of the stakeholders involved (from highly trained human-machine teams to a cohort of elderly / children), also affect the possible value considerations deeply. This track aims to provide a venue for discussions of problems, possible solution-concepts best practices, benchmarks, related to machine ethics. | Submissions are solicited on, but not limited to, the following themes / questions: | What kinds of values and value-conflicts are (in)expressible in algorithmic form? 
  Can ethical behaviour be guaranteed or verified in computational media? 
  Implementation of ethical reasoning mechanisms founded on non-western ethical traditions 
  Can artificial moral decision-making be decoupled from mere implementation of normative ethical theories? 
  Privacy and Trust relationships between humans and machines in the presence of hybrid actions 
  Implementation of ethical reasoning in logic-based methods 
  Representation of ethical principles in AI agents 
  Machine-learning based approaches to ethical reasoning 
  Development of machine ethics in cognitive robot programs 
  Robot learning for ethical reasoning 
  Integration of symbolic and neural information systems for ethical reasoning 
  Development of formal frameworks for ethical decision-making 
  Techniques for explaining the ethical reasoning of AI agents 
  Frameworks for ethical collaboration between humans and AI agents 
  Building trust in intelligent systems through ethical design and interaction 
  Agent Toolkits (15 pages + reference) | This track aims to provide a forum for researchers that are involved in developing agent/MAS toolkits and platforms, or that are using them for the development of applications, to exchange ideas, make proposals, suggest challenges, reports interesting use cases and so on - any aspect that could be of interest in the engineering and using Agent Toolkits. 
  Demonstrators (5 pages + references) | This track aims to provide opportunities for participants from academia and industry to present their latest developments in agent-based systems. Demonstrations of interest include both applications of multi-agent systems and tools that support developers in the specification, design, implementation and testing of agent systems.

 Invited Talks  
 Franziska Klugl | : Towards More Credible Agent-Based Simulations | Abstract: | Agent-based simulation is widely recognized as a well-established application of multi-agent systems. However, in many fields—such as epidemiology and economics—where other modeling and simulation paradigms are standard, there is still hesitation in accepting agent-based approaches. In newer application areas like Multi-Robot Systems and Machine Learning, where simulations are often used as proxies for real systems, quality standards emerged that need to be met. In this talk, I will explore, drawing on my own experiences and those of others, why the credibility of agent-based models and their simulation results continues to be a challenge, despite decades of development and application. I will also present ideas on how to address this credibility problem. 
  Julian Padget | : Governing complex commons: an accidental transdisciplinary tour | Abstract: | We all know a complex system when we see one :) and as computer scientists we might pause and wonder about what makes it work. | Multiagent systems are our complex system playground and one approach we use to try to govern them is norms. Not that norms are that easy to write or test or change. Despite this, much has been written in recent years about more abstract notions of governance for AI, drawing on ethics and even morality. This in turn has led to a focus on values, which can be seen as a bridge between ethics and norms, being more concrete than ethics but more abstract than norms. But which values? | If values are the answer, how do we engineer socio-technical systems that are capable of reflecting what stakeholders want now and in the future? Values themselves are more problematic than norms. At least norms can be codified as rules, although that process is hard and eventually messy (in my experience). We take the view that values are bit like constants: they don't change but their importance does. So, depending on the context, it is stakeholders' preferences over values determine what it means for system behaviour to be aligned with stakeholder values. Thus we belatedly arrive at Stuart Russell's 2014 observation that "we need to build intelligence that is provably aligned with human values". | Taking some diversions for perspectives from outside computer science - power-train design, public policy and immunotherapy - we will sketch out some ideas, looking at both process and product, for realising future socio-technical systems - in which agents are key building blocks - where the problem (for us) is how to achieve continuous alignment against changing stakeholder value preferences.

 Call For Papers  

 EUMAS 2024 welcomes original, unpublished papers including improved versions of extended abstracts or rejected papers from AAMAS, AAAI and IJCAI 2023. The submission should describe work that has not been previously published, accepted for publication nor is currently under review by another conference or journal.  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed in a single blind fashion. Submission length depends upon the track that you submit to. Additional pages may be used for references and, if needed, a clearly marked appendix. It should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS format. For templates and instructions for authors, see Conference proceedings guidelines    . Authors must submit their papers through the EUMAS 2024 Easychair submission site    as a single PDF file.  
 This year, EUMAS is accepting submissions across 4 tracks:  
 Main Track (15 pages + references) | Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Action and Planning Adaptation and Learning; Agent Architectures; Agent Programming Languages; Agent Development Methodologies and Tools; Agent-Based Simulations and Modeling; Agent Organizations and Institutions; Agent-oriented Software Engineering; Agents and Complex Systems; Applications of Multi-agent Systems; Argumentation; Automated negotiation; Biologically inspired approaches; Cognitive Models; Collective and Swarm Intelligence; Collective Intentionality; Communication Cooperation, and Coordination; Computational Social Choice; Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Agent Domains; Economic Models; Electronic Commerce; Ethical behavior of multi-agent systems; Formal Modelling; Game-Theoretic Methods; Human-Agent Interaction; Logics for Multi-Agent Systems; Logics for Strategic Reasoning; Machine Learning for Multi-Agent Systems; Multi-Agent Learning; Multi-Robot Systems; Negotiation; Self-organization; Semantic Web Agents; Social Networks; Socio-technical Systems; Theories of Agency; Trust and Reputation; Verification; Virtual Agents; Voting and Judgment Aggregation Models for Multi-Agent Systems 
  Agents and Ethics (15 pages + references) | This track is focussed on the implementation of ethical reasoning mechanisms in various autonomous decision-making settings. Depending on the context of the agent (software / hardware), the kinds of values (or value-conflicts) that are encountered could be quite varied. The multiplicity and agency of the stakeholders involved (from highly trained human-machine teams to a cohort of elderly / children), also affect the possible value considerations deeply. This track aims to provide a venue for discussions of problems, possible solution-concepts best practices, benchmarks, related to machine ethics. | Submissions are solicited on, but not limited to, the following themes / questions: | What kinds of values and value-conflicts are (in)expressible in algorithmic form? 
  Can ethical behaviour be guaranteed or verified in computational media? 
  Implementation of ethical reasoning mechanisms founded on non-western ethical traditions 
  Can artificial moral decision-making be decoupled from mere implementation of normative ethical theories? 
  Privacy and Trust relationships between humans and machines in the presence of hybrid actions 
  Implementation of ethical reasoning in logic-based methods 
  Representation of ethical principles in AI agents 
  Machine-learning based approaches to ethical reasoning 
  Development of machine ethics in cognitive robot programs 
  Robot learning for ethical reasoning 
  Integration of symbolic and neural information systems for ethical reasoning 
  Development of formal frameworks for ethical decision-making 
  Techniques for explaining the ethical reasoning of AI agents 
  Frameworks for ethical collaboration between humans and AI agents 
  Building trust in intelligent systems through ethical design and interaction 
  Agent Toolkits (15 pages + reference) | This track aims to provide a forum for researchers that are involved in developing agent/MAS toolkits and platforms, or that are using them for the development of applications, to exchange ideas, make proposals, suggest challenges, reports interesting use cases and so on - any aspect that could be of interest in the engineering and using Agent Toolkits. 
  Demonstrators (5 pages + references) | This track aims to provide opportunities for participants from academia and industry to present their latest developments in agent-based systems. Demonstrations of interest include both applications of multi-agent systems and tools that support developers in the specification, design, implementation and testing of agent systems.

 Invited Talks  
 Franziska Klugl | : Towards More Credible Agent-Based Simulations | Abstract: | Agent-based simulation is widely recognized as a well-established application of multi-agent systems. However, in many fields—such as epidemiology and economics—where other modeling and simulation paradigms are standard, there is still hesitation in accepting agent-based approaches. In newer application areas like Multi-Robot Systems and Machine Learning, where simulations are often used as proxies for real systems, quality standards emerged that need to be met. In this talk, I will explore, drawing on my own experiences and those of others, why the credibility of agent-based models and their simulation results continues to be a challenge, despite decades of development and application. I will also present ideas on how to address this credibility problem. 
  Julian Padget | : Governing complex commons: an accidental transdisciplinary tour | Abstract: | We all know a complex system when we see one :) and as computer scientists we might pause and wonder about what makes it work. | Multiagent systems are our complex system playground and one approach we use to try to govern them is norms. Not that norms are that easy to write or test or change. Despite this, much has been written in recent years about more abstract notions of governance for AI, drawing on ethics and even morality. This in turn has led to a focus on values, which can be seen as a bridge between ethics and norms, being more concrete than ethics but more abstract than norms. But which values? | If values are the answer, how do we engineer socio-technical systems that are capable of reflecting what stakeholders want now and in the future? Values themselves are more problematic than norms. At least norms can be codified as rules, although that process is hard and eventually messy (in my experience). We take the view that values are bit like constants: they don't change but their importance does. So, depending on the context, it is stakeholders' preferences over values determine what it means for system behaviour to be aligned with stakeholder values. Thus we belatedly arrive at Stuart Russell's 2014 observation that "we need to build intelligence that is provably aligned with human values". | Taking some diversions for perspectives from outside computer science - power-train design, public policy and immunotherapy - we will sketch out some ideas, looking at both process and product, for realising future socio-technical systems - in which agents are key building blocks - where the problem (for us) is how to achieve continuous alignment against changing stakeholder value preferences.

 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN)  
 Area Chairs  : Long Tran-Thanh, Bo An, Marc Lanctot, Chongjie Zhang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Xu, Jakob Foerster  
 Topics  :  
 Reasoning and learning under uncertainty 
  Supervised learning 
  Unsupervised and representation learning 
  Reinforcement learning 
  Multiagent learning 
  Evolutionary algorithms 
  Learning agent capabilities 
  Learning agent-to-agent interactions

  Adversarial learning 
  Description  : Autonomous Agents must sense, deliberate, act and communicate in potentially complex and uncertain environments. In addition, in many cases, they must interact with other agents and/or humans. Anticipating each situation and hardcoding the appropriate agent behavior becomes impossible as the complexity of the environment and interactions increase. As such, adaptivity and learning are key properties that imbue autonomy to agents operating and communicating in the real world. Papers in this area focus on all aspects of single agent and multiagent planning, learning and communication.  
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP)  
 Area Chairs  : Reshef Meir, Nisarg Shah, Georgios Piliouras, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Rica Gonen

  Agreement Technologies: Negotiation and Argumentations 
  Responsible socio-technical systems 
  Description  : Research in agent and multiagent systems has a long history of developing techniques that balance agent autonomy, adaptation, and distributed social reasoning with system-level considerations such as organizational and institutional policy enforcement addressing safety, security and fairness considerations. Teamwork and human-machine cooperation has an increased relevance with the transformation of our societies into socio-technical systems. We need to ensure transparency, foster trust, and ensure social reasoning conforms to societal norms and expectations. We also need to ensure human-machine and machine-machine cooperation is fostered responsibly, within an adequate accountability system and in alignment with the ethical values of individuals concerned. We encourage the submission of papers that highlight the design, development, evaluation, simulation, and analysis of novel, innovative, and impactful research on issues related to the above topics.

  Description  : Artificial societies are computer simulations or models that are created to emulate and research the behavior of intricate social systems. These societies simulate the interactions and dynamics of people, animals or other organisms to understand how individual behaviors lead to emergent structures and interactions. Agent-based models of artificial society provide a way to analyze the impact of regulations, incentives and other interventions that help to understand the complex dynamics of society as a whole. The area aims to find efficient solutions to model and simulate complex societal systems using agents-based models. Important application areas include ecology, biology, economics, transportation, management, organizational, and social sciences in general. In these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, exploration and testing of hypotheses, and better system designs.  
 Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)  
 Area Chairs  : Michael Goodrich, Birgit Lugrin  
 Topics  :  
 Human-agent interaction 
  Agent-based analysis of human interactions 
  Socially interactive agents 
  Trust and explainability in human-agent interactions 
  Human-robot interaction and collaboration 
  Social robotics and social interactions 
  Mixed-initiative and shared autonomy in human-agent interactions 
  Groups of humans and agents 
  Agents models and architectures for interaction with humans 
  Designing for human-agent interaction 
  Virtual humans 
  Description  :  
 Human interaction with artificially intelligent agents is becoming more commonplace, as such, developing and evaluating agents that can understand humans’ dynamics to support competent interaction. Significant challenges arise when transitioning from pure multiagent systems to hybrid systems that need to incorporate bi-directional human and agent interactions and sustain different competitive or collaborative situations. Agents need new models and architectures to better address the interaction with humans, including perception and recognition of humans’ internal states and activities at different levels, interaction modalities that support true coordination, and incorporation of human factors and ethics concerns. The design of human-agent interaction needs special concerns that combine requirements from the perspectives of both the agents and the humans. The interactive behavior of such agents can be inspired by human-human interaction and can, additionally, be embodied by virtual agents or robots to scaffold intuitive interaction.  
 Robotics and Control (ROBOT)

All papers at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence (and agent research, specifically) are in the scope of the robotics area at AAMAS.  
 Innovative Applications (IA)  
 Area Chairs  : Thanh Nguyen, Pradeep Varakantham  
 Topics  :  
 Deployed or emerging applications of agent-based systems 
  Realistic agent-based models of human organizations 
  Evaluation of the cognitive capabilities of agent-based systems 
  Integrated applications of agent-based and other technologies 
  Challenges and best practices of real-world deployments of agent-based technologies 
  Description  : The innovative applications area aims to showcase successful applications and novel uses of agent-based technologies. We encourage research on emerging areas of agent-based applications with measurable benefits, on various topics such as (but not limited to) social good, sustainability, and ethical AI. The innovative applications area is keen to attract research that is not only triggered by real-world applications, but provides realistic beneficial solutions for these applications. Collaborations with relevant stakeholders is highly valued, as it helps demonstrate the feasibility and impact of the work.  
 Special Tracks  
 In addition to the main track, AAMAS 2025 will feature four special tracks: the AAAI Resubmissions Track   , the Blue Sky Ideas Track   , the JAAMAS Track  , and the Demo Track  , each with a separate Call for Papers (to be posted when available).  
 The focus of the Blue Sky Ideas Track is on visionary ideas, long-term challenges, new research opportunities, and controversial debate. The JAAMAS Track offers authors of papers recently published in the journal Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems  (JAAMAS) that have not previously appeared as full papers in an archival conference the opportunity to present their work at AAMAS 2025. The Demo Track, finally, allows participants from both academia and industry to showcase their latest developments in agent-based and robotic systems.

 Smart Ethics:  
  the leading role of ethics in the digital world  
 University of La Rioja, Logroño, Spain | March 13-15, 2024  
 More info about the conference    

 About the conference   
 21st International Conference on the Ethical and Social Impacts of ICT  
 We are living in a smart world, where everything looks smart. The use of the term “smart” is a buzzword. Technology becomes the backbone of virtually every aspect of our life: work, relations, health, education, leisure, … In our next international conference, ETHICOMP 2024, we wonder if the current state of technological revolution is truly smart. What does “smart” really mean in digital contexts, and what should “smart” signify? If technology becomes smart, what is the impact on computer ethics and digital ethics? It is unquestionable that any smart technology must be ethical in both its development and its uses, but cases of unethical practices in the digital world, which are often hidden by technological determinism, are increasing. The analysis of unethical practices and the search for solutions to create a digitally healthy society is the theme of our next conference: digital ethics should lead the smart revolution, but is it doing so? What should we do to locate digital ethics at the core of the smart revolution? What are the ethical requirements for smart in order that it will sustain societal welfare?  
   
  The ETHICOMP series of conferences fosters an international community of scholars and technologists, including computer professionals and business professionals from industry. Since 1995, conferences have been scheduled across Europe and Asia, with our main events coming every 18 months. ETHICOMP considers computer ethics conceived broadly to include philosophical, professional, and practical aspects of the field.  
   
  We invite submissions that explore this theme, interpreted broadly, as well as more specific tracks addressing particular issues relevant to the conference theme. A more detailed description of each track is available at the online version of Call for Papers. Questions may also be directed to the relevant Track Chairs.

 Smart Ethics: the leading role of ethics in the digital world   
   
  La Rioja University and Complutense University of Madrid  
  Logroño, Spain   
 March 13-15, 2024   

 We are living in a smart world, where everything looks smart. The use of the term “smart” is a buzzword. Technology becomes the backbone of virtually every aspect of our life: work, relations, health, education, leisure, … In our next international conference, ETHICOMP 2024, we wonder if the current state of technological revolution is truly smart. What does “smart” really mean in digital contexts, and what should “smart” signify? If technology becomes smart, what is the impact on computer ethics and digital ethics? It is unquestionable that any smart technology must be ethical in both its development and its uses, but cases of unethical practices in the digital world, which are often hidden by technological determinism, are increasing. The analysis of unethical practices and the search for solutions to create a digitally healthy society is the theme of our next conference: digital ethics should lead the smart revolution, but is it doing so? What should we do to locate digital ethics at the core of the smart revolution? What are the ethical requirements for smart in order that it will sustain societal welfare?  
   
  The ETHICOMP series of conferences fosters an international community of scholars and technologists, including computer professionals and business professionals from industry. Since 1995, conferences have been scheduled across Europe and Asia, with our main events coming every 18 months. ETHICOMP considers computer ethics conceived broadly to include philosophical, professional, and practical aspects of the field.  
   
  We invite submissions that explore this theme, interpreted broadly, as well as more specific tracks addressing particular issues relevant to the conference theme. A more detailed description of each track are listed below, and questions may also be directed to the relevant Track Chairs.  

 Submission guidelines   
 Authors can choose to submit either to the general open track, or to a specific track. Initial submissions should take the form of extended abstracts of 1000-1500 words  . All accepted extended abstracts will be published in proceedings with ISBN. If their extended abstract has been accepted, authors can voluntarily submit full papers (max. 8000 words) that will be published as a book chapter in the ETHICOMP Book series.  
   
  We welcome perspectives from researchers in business, government, computer science, information systems, law, media, anthropology, pedagogy, psychology, sociology, ethics and philosophy. Interdisciplinary papers and papers from new researchers and practitioners are encouraged. Papers can involve a variety of approaches, including those with a conceptual, applied, practical, or historical focus, as well as case studies and reports on lessons learned in practice.  
   
  As in previous ETHICOMP conferences, only papers written in English and not published nor submitted elsewhere will be accepted on the basis of an extended abstract after a careful, double-blind review overseen by the Program Committee. Authors may submit more than one abstract but acceptance of multiple proposals by a single author or co-author will be weighed against available space to ensure we can include as many authors as is practical for ETHICOMP 2024. At least one of the authors should register and attend the conference, presenting their paper. Presentations of papers in the conference can be done in regular presentations (15’ presentation + 15’ questions & debate) and panels (90’ with up to 6 papers, 5’-10’ presentation + open panel questions & debate).  
   
  You can find more information in the submission section.  

 List of tracks   
  
  1. Open Track   
  (Kiyoshi Murata, Meiji University, kmurata@meiji.ac.jp; Ana María Lara Palma, Universidad de Burgos, amlara@ubu.es; Yohko Orito, Ehime University, orito.yohko.mm@ehime-u.ac.jp)   
   
  Any topic in computer ethics, broadly construed. Topics related to the computer ethics field, conceived broadly, to include philosophical, professional, and practical aspects of the field.  
   
  2. Values in the Smart Technology Revolution   
  (Adam Poulsen. Brain and Mind Centre, The University of Sydney. Sydney, Australia. adam.poulsen@sydney.edu.au; and Oliver Burmeister. School of Computing, Mathematics and Engineering, Charles Sturt University. Orange, Australia, oburmeister@csu.edu.au)  
    
  Until recently human values have shaped technology, and technology has shaped human values. But with the advent of OpenAI’s ChatGPT a revolution that has only been theorised previously is in its embryonic stages. AI values and how they might shape human societies in the future need to be proactively considered, rather than waiting for this revolution and then reacting to it. As smart technology becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, it is crucial to understand the interplay between values and smart technology design, development, implementation, and use. The smart revolution raises questions about the impact of smart technology on values, and the development and application of ethical standards, guidelines, and codes for the use of smart technology. Best practices for designing smart technologies that align with human values and consider the role of government, organisations, communities, and individual end-users in realising value sensitive smart technology all require deep thought. Thus, this track is open for submissions that explore smart technology and values, such as trust, freedom from bias, privacy, autonomy, environmental sustainability, informed consent, human welfare, AI values, and more.  
   
  3. Smarter Security- Resilience and Recovery  
   (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu; and Sabina Szymoniak Czestochowa University of Technology, sabina.szymoniak@icis.pcz.pl)  
    
  Increasingly complex tech stacks result in more security vulnerabilities. At the same time, there’s a talent shortage, which inhibits an organization’s ability to protect itself. Given the changes in technology, digital infrastructure is now business-critical infrastructure where cybersecurity best practices should go beyond just “identify, protect, detect, and respond.” Cybersecurity needs to consider not only specific data or IT systems, but also the risks posed to business processes. For example, implications of artificial intelligence and intelligent automation that can reduce the cost and time of security operations significantly. This track invites papers that discuss ethical implications, risk and resilience because standard business continuity arrangements are insufficient in the face of increasing cyber breaches.  
   
  4. Smart Education: transforming learning in the digital age  
   (Mario Arias-Oliva, Complutense University of Madrid, mario.arias@ucm.es; Antonio Pérez-Portabella, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, antonio.perezportabella@urv.cat; Teresa Pintado, Complutense University of Madrid, tpintado@ucm.es; Joaquín Sánchez Herrera, Complutense University of Madrid, joaquins@ucm.es)  
    
  The theme of this year’s conference focuses on how education and pedagogy styles need to be modified to cater for the new and advanced technology changes and dependency. Not all students receive the education necessary to help them express their full potential be it due to a lack of resources or access to high quality teaching. The lack of high-quality educational material and teaching aids and methodologies and non-availability of objective feedback on how they can become even better teachers, deprive our teachers from achieving their full potential. This track particularly welcomes papers focusing on concepts, principles, and techniques from an educational perspective for enhancing the potential of all the stakeholders in the education system.  

  5. Marketing and Smart Ethics in the digital world  
   (Jesús García de Madariaga, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, egarci@ucm.es; Alba García Milon, Universidad de La Rioja, alba.garciam@unirioja.es; Natalia Medrano Sáez, Universidad de La Rioja, natalia.medrano@unirioja.es; Cristina Olarte Pascual, La Rioja University, cristina.olarte@unirioja.es; Eva Reinares, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, eva.reinares@urjc.es)   
   
  In recent years the presence of technology in everyday life has accelerated and new technologies have entered directly into the way we manage personal and professional aspects of our lives. From a positive point of view, available information in digital format (blogs, social networks, etc.) helps us to optimize the process of selecting the best products and make better decisions. Potential benefits are e.g., cost savings, immediacy, or time-saving. However, there is a controversial debate about the ethical aspects and the moral dilemmas that are generated between producer/consumer and buyer/seller. In this track, the main focus lies on moral dilemmas in marketing, such as privacy, online pricing ethics, ethics in online promotion, controversial marketing strategies, media ethics, consumer manipulation/target emotions, social media emotion detection, expectation of consumers towards digital communication, ethics and ethical standards from both the consumers and enterprises point of view and the different cultural, educational and especially political background of regions and how they can affect marketing worldwide, among others. All interested participants in this track are invited to share their ideas, experiences, and research results.  
   
  6. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Ethics  
   (Ramón Carrasco, Complutense University of Madrid, ramoncar@ucm.es; Orlando Lima Rua, Polytechnic of Porto, orua@iscap.ipp.pt; Jorge Pelegrín-Borondo, La Rioja University, jorge.pelegrin@unirioja.es; Pedro Cuesta Valiño, Universidad de Alcalá de Henares, pedro.cuesta@uah.es; Pablo Gutierrez Rodríguez, León University, pablo.gutierrez@unileon.es)  
    
  Can machines think? This question was proposed by Alan M. Turing (1950) in the mid-twentieth century. The answer to this question is the proposal of the so-called Turing test. In this test, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered the way of operating that imitates the intelligent behavior of human beings. From then until now, AI has been overtaking humans in tasks for which intelligence and creativity were supposed to be required: strategy games, image recognition, medical diagnoses, music composition, etc. Everything has been thanks to the improvement of algorithms, especially those known as black box algorithms, i.e., whose logic is not understandable by a human being. We therefore find ourselves in a paradox in which decision-making will increasingly be based on an AI that we cannot understand. Going even further, we can say that a society directed by a technology that it is unable to understand is destined to lose its freedom. The issue of explainability of algorithms has given rise to a new area called Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). This need for interpretability is legislated in some sectors such as finance, but to what extent is society aware of this need for interpretability? This session will discuss advances in XAI and its relation to the ethics of algorithms, interpretation of possible biases of algorithms, social awareness of the need for interpretability and the need for legislation on this issue, in short any aspect of interpretability of algorithms that challenges individuals, organizations or society as a whole.  
   
  7. Reducing Gender Gap as We build an Inclusive Community within a Smart City  
   (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu; and Graciela Padilla Castillo, Complutense University of Madrid, gracielp@ucm.es)  
    
  This track is a platform where we invite you to share ideas, stories and research that advocates the importance of bridging the gap of women in the technology workforce. Research and reports indicate that it is important to create a strong community where like-minded women in tech, share ideas, identify role models, find mentors and mentees, engage in global discussions and celebrate the power of face-to-face interactions. This not only inspires people and organizations but also can lead to deliver actionable insight, guidance and advice through expert-led technical role models. It also creates an environment where skills development can be enhanced and creates a safe platform to elevate diverse voices. Such community building can support inclusivity and learn how you can play an integral part in creating an inclusive industry that benefits not only women, male allies and organization, but contributes to a more equitable society. We cannot create a Smart Society if it is not for all of us.

 About the Conference  

 Welcome to EURO 2025  

 On behalf of The Operational Research Society  , the University of Leeds  is honoured to be hosting the 34th European Conference on Operational Research  in 2025. Offering a warm Yorkshire welcome, we are delighted to make the 50th Anniversary of EURO a memorable experience for all.  
 The UK has a significant history and influence in the field of Operational Research (OR). Originating during World War II, OR was developed in Britain to address complex military logistics and strategy problems. Post-war, it played a pivotal role in decision-making and strategy, helping to solve complex problems through the innovative use of mathematics and science.  
 British universities, particularly institutions like the University of Leeds, have been instrumental in advancing OR research and education, fostering innovations that drive efficiency and decision-making processes in both public and private sectors.  
 The University of Leeds is a prestigious institution known for its research excellence and provides an ideal setting for the EURO 2025 conference. Located in the heart of Leeds, the university boasts state-of-the-art facilities and a vibrant academic environment that will inspire and facilitate engaging discussions and collaborations. We have a truly global community, with more than 39,000 students from 170 different countries and over 9,000 staff of 100 different nationalities.  
 While we delve into the intricacies of algorithms and analytics, let’s not forget to enjoy the charm of Leeds. Whether it’s exploring the historic city centre or enjoying a cup of Yorkshire tea, we hope your stay will be both intellectually stimulating and personally enjoyable. Leeds offers a great combination of modern European energy with a strong heritage and a huge warm and friendly welcome.  
 EURO 2025 will be packed with insightful presentations, engaging discussions, and opportunities for networking. With a wide array of topics and cutting-edge research, the conference is designed to inspire and challenge attendees, fostering growth and collaboration.

  Submission  
  We invite authors to submit extended abstracts of their original research. Submissions must be formatted in LaTeX using a supplied class file, and not be longer than 175 lines of text. Submissions will be handled through EasyChair  .  
 Authors must use the LaTeX class files euroCG25  and eurocg25-submission  , which are based on the LIPIcs class file. These class files should automatically count all lines containing text, excluding title and references, and excluding figures. Authors are expected to make reasonable effort to make sure all lines that contain text are counted: the class file should be considered an aid, and the responsibility of correctly counting lines remains with the authors. A zip file containing an example of how to use the class file can be found here  .  
 Your submission should provide a clear statement of your results including proofs. The main (175 line) body of your submission should be self-contained and contain a clear and succinct description of your results. Content that does not fit in the main body due to space restrictions must be placed into a clearly marked appendix, which will only be read at the discretion of the program committee.  
  
  Acceptance Policy  
  EuroCG is a non-competitive forum. We will accept all submissions which are original, correct, well-presented, non-trivial, and in scope. The program committee judges submissions on these five criteria, each of which can lead to rejection. If a submission satisfies all criteria, then it will be accepted: there is no competition against other submissions. For this reason authors are not requested to hide their names and affiliations at the time of their submission (the review process will not be double blind).  
 ● | Originality | : If a submission does not contain original research by the authors, or if there is good reason to believe this is the case this is a reason for rejection. We do not accept submissions which have already been accepted for publication in a conference and/or journal at the date of the EuroCG submission deadline. However, we do explicitly allow submissions that are under review at another conference or journal at the date of the EuroCG submission deadline. 
  ● | Correctness | : If the main / a major result of a submission is not correct, this is a reason for rejection. If an attentive reviewer cannot establish correctness of the results from the content of the submission, this is a reason for rejection. However, an acceptance at EuroCG is no correctness guarantee. 
  ● | Presentation | : If a submission is written in a way that makes it unreadable, or it does not follow the submission guidelines as listed in the call for contributions, this is a reason for rejection. 
  ● | Technical Depth | : If a submission is trivial, this is a reason for rejection. However, there is no minimum level of technical depth required. 
  ● | Scope | : If a submission is out of scope, this is a reason for rejection. However, we wish to be inclusive in our interpretation of scope, which includes but is not limited to the list of topics in the call for contributions. 

  Proceedings  
  EuroCG does not have formally reviewed proceedings. A booklet of abstracts, without ISBN, will be accessible online on the website for the benefit of the community and must be regarded as a collection of preprints rather than a formally reviewed selection of papers. Results presented at EuroCG are expected to appear in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.  
 Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the Computing in Geometry and Topology (CGT)  journal.  
 There will also be a voting for the Best Student Presentation  .  
  
  Attendance and presentation of papers at the conference  
  EuroCG is dedicated to providing an environment that is free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation for all participants. According to the decision taken at EuroCG 2024  , from 2025 onwards EuroCG will be organized as an event of the CG Society  . Only members of the Society can attend EuroCG. Society membership is free. All members of the Society are bound by its Code of Conduct  . A person whose membership has been suspended, for example by the Code of Conduct Committee  , cannot attend EuroCG in person.  
 EuroCG is fundamentally an in-person event and all presentations are expected to be given in person. Hence at least one author of an accepted contribution must become a member of the society and attend EuroCG. If no author of an accepted contribution is attending EuroCG, then the contribution may be removed from the program, the booklet of abstracts, and the conference website.

   About 

 The European Workshop on Computational Geometry  (EuroCG) is an annual, informal workshop that combines a strong scientific tradition with a friendly and informal atmosphere. The workshop is a forum where established researchers and students can meet, discuss their work, present their results, and establish scientific collaborations. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. EuroCG does not have proceedings; the abstracts of accepted presentations are available on the website of the corresponding year, and should be regarded as preprints.  
 EuroCG does not have any formal organizational structure. Decisions about the venues for future years or about changes to the established processes are taken via votes at the business meeting. At EuroCG 2024, the task force preparing the CG Society presented the plans for the Society and the possibilities for EuroCG  at the business meeting. On Thursday, March 14, 2024 a vote was held by secret ballot on the question “Does EuroCG want to be organized as an event of the CG Society?” The results were 63 votes in favor, 10 votes against, and 1 blank vote. Correspondingly, starting in 2025, EuroCG will be organized as an event of the CG Society.

 Evaluation of industrial embedded control system designs is a time-consuming and imperfect process. While an ideal process would apply a formal verification technique such as model checking or theorem proving, these techniques do not scale to industrial design problems, and it is often difficult to use these techniques to verify performance aspects of control system designs, such as stability or convergence. For industrial designs, engineers rely on testing processes to identify critical or unexpected behaviors. We propose a novel framework called Underminer  to improve the testing process; this is an automated technique to identify nonconverging behaviors in embedded control system designs. Underminer treats the system as a black box and lets the designer indicate the model parameters, inputs, and outputs that are of interest. It differentiates convergent from nonconvergent behaviors using Convergence Classifier Functions (CCFs).   
 The tool can be applied in the context of testing models created late in the controller development stage, where it assumes that the given model displays mostly convergent behavior and learns a CCF in an unsupervised fashion from such convergent model behaviors. This CCF is then used to guide a thorough exploration of the model with the help of optimization-guided techniques or adaptive sampling techniques, with the goal of identifying rare nonconvergent model behaviors. Underminer can also be used early in the development stage, where models may have some significant nonconvergent behaviors. Here, the framework permits designers to indicate their mental model for convergence by labeling behaviors as convergent/nonconvergent and then constructs a CCF using a supervised learning technique. In this use case, the goal is to use the CCF to test an improved design for the model. Underminer supports a number of convergence-like notions, such as those based on Lyapunov analysis and temporal logic, and also CCFs learned directly from labeled output behaviors using machine-learning techniques such as support vector machines and neural networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of Underminer by evaluating its performance on several academic as well as industrial examples.

 Welcome to the Driving Simulation Conference Europe 2025 VR website!  

 The Driving Simulation Conference gathers driving simulation specialists from the industrial and academic communities as well as commercial simulation providers. This 24th edition follows that of 2024, held in Strasbourg, in a hybrid version with about 300+ participants. The exhibition is coming back towards more than 40 professional exhibitors and up to 400 on site participants. With about 80 speakers in scientific and industrial product solution sessions, keynotes, tutorials and round tables, you will get the latest trends in XIL (MIL, SIL, HIL, DIL, VIL, CIL) and XR simulation for ADAS, automotive HMI and driving simulation design, motion sickness and rendering, as well as connected and autonomous vehicle verification and validation.   
 Themes include state of the art in driving simulation technology, research and developments, extended with progressively emerging virtual and augmented reality (XR) developments. This year’s program will also host a special session on virtual validation and certification tools for autonomous and connected vehicles along with advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) applications. Human factors and motion rendering nevertheless will stay as a now traditional axes of the conference.   
    
 You are welcome to the DSC 2025 Europe Conference organized by the Driving Simulation Association, in cooperation with Arts et Métiers Institute of Technology and Gustave Eiffel University, held on September 24-26 in Stuttgart for the conference and exhibition!

 Submissions  
 Submissions must be at most 27 pages using the Springer LNCS format, including title page and figures, but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following after the main body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read or review beyond the main body, and submissions are expected to be intelligible, and show sufficient scientific quality and depth, without the supplementary material.  
 The above in particular means that submissions are expected to present the core technical part of the result(s) in the main body  . Thus, the main body should allow the reader to understand and verify what is at the heart of the contribution, conceptually and technically; the supplementary material should be used mainly for tying up the loose ends, spelling out the less innovative parts, providing extensions/generalizations, etc.  
 The final published version of an accepted paper will be limited to 30 pages including references and is expected to closely match the submission. For further details, consult the paper submission page.  

 Review Process  
 Eurocrypt 2025 will operate a two-round review system with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions that will proceed to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to respond to the reviews. Furthermore, in cases where this is considered useful by the PC chairs and/or the reviewers, additional communication between authors and reviewers may be initiated (in both rounds).  
 The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews (early rejects) may be submitted to other conferences after the first round notification date.  
 In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account the rebuttal letters. The committee then makes the final decision of acceptance or rejection.  
 Early Withdrawal  
 Until final decisions have been made, authors can only withdraw their paper with the express approval of the program chairs.  
  
 PC Member Submissions  
 PC members and area chairs are restricted to submit either 1 single-author paper, up to 2 papers if at least one of them is with a co-author, or up to 3 papers if all are with co-authors and at least two are with student co-authors. The PC co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.  

 Awards  
 The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at early stages of their careers, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by early-career researchers. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.  
  
 Stipends  
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. Furthermore, a limited number of stipends are available to students that are unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.  
  
 Artifacts  
 To encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on the IACR's artifact archive at artifacts.iacr.org. Please see the detailed call for artifacts.

 Take a decisive step toward fact-based decisions  
 Through efficiency, quality and ease of use, Research AI enables you to think in a data-driven, fact-based and unbiased way.  

 We understand you in  
    
 Making wise decisions is the key to success in virtually any field of work. Yet there is little guidance available to help nurture this unique and valuable skill. This is where our Research AI proves to be your most valuable companion, with a unique combination of human-curated, rich data, perfectly intuitive operation, speed, and an almost infinite variety of languages. Choosing Research AI will therefore be the first of many great decisions you will make in the future.  
   
 What is the most spoken language in the world?  

 As of 2023, English is the most spoken language worldwide when considering both native and second-language speakers, with approximately 1.5 billion people speaking it [1]. Mandarin Chinese is the second most spoken, with around 1.14 billion speakers [2][1]. These figures include speakers of these languages as a mother tongue or a second language used in everyday life. It's important to note that while Mandarin has the highest number of native speakers, estimated at around 917 million [3], the inclusion of second-language speakers propels English to the top spot globally.  

 Ease of use  
 Complex requests solved simply  
 While your questions may be complex, the tool you use to answer them shouldn’t be. That’s why Research AI is designed to give you exactly the valuable insights you’re looking for, regardless of your experience with AI or Statista, what language you speak, or how specific your search is.  

 Efficiency  
 Your shortcut to lasting good decisions  
 Time is money, as they say, so urgency is key. However, it’s a real shame to see your savings go up in smoke due to poor decisions. Research AI offers a double advantage: find insights in the blink of an eye that will lead you to eternally sound decisions.  

 Quality  
 Half human, half AI  
 The decisions you are facing are too important to be made on the basis of opaque, possibly erroneous data. With Research AI, artificial and human intelligence work hand in hand to create unique synergies: the AI presents you with data that has been curated and carefully checked by Statista experts.  
 The best solution to transform complex data into understandable insights: Research AI.  

 Innovation  
 Uniquely customized  
 Knowledge is not the same as insight. However, reliable decisions can only be made on the basis of real findings that meet individual requirements. Unlike generic statistical AIs, Research AI provides you with a customized narrative based on high-quality data collected and/or verified by Statista experts. In other words, it gives you real insight.  
 Semantic Search Embeddings  
 Large Language Models (LLMs)  
 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)  

 What excites our users about Research AI?  
 It’s actually one of the best AI tools I’ve used. The number of resources the tool pulls from is great. Plus, the AI-generated descriptions are very well-written. I’ve used it several times to help contextualise people's questions.

 The people behind Research AI  
 Empowering people with data  
 We are Statista, a global data and business intelligence platform with an extensive collection of statistics, reports, and insights. As pioneers in the data economy, we strive to create a world that is more transparent, reliable, and trustworthy. By empowering people with data, we want to help them build a better society by making fact-based decisions.  

 Media’s favorite source  
 The largest and most trusted media organizations in the world all have one thing in common: they love to cite Statista – and increasingly so. While we’re honored to be referenced in great articles and reports, we’re perhaps even more flattered that major consulting firms like BCG and McKinsey, as well as prestigious universities such as Oxford and Harvard, use Statista to provide fact-based insights.  

 Depth in breadth  
 Our database is useful for everyone. With 170 industries and 150+ countries & territories, a unique combination of exclusive in-house statistics, generally accessible data, and exclusive data partnerships as well as 22,500 different sources, we cover a huge range – and provide a depth of information that is unique in its breadth.  

 FAQ  
 You have the questions, we have the answers  

 Getting started   

 Functionality & features   

 General   

  How does Research AI work?   
 Research AI V1 leverages semantic search and Cohere technology to pinpoint the most pertinent Statista data for any given user query. Research AI accesses content and datasets from the 10 most relevant sources, links them to the user query, and feeds the bundled information into our LLM (Claude 3 Sonnet). This process generates detailed responses, and we integrate citations directly into the text, making the narratives easy to understand and fact-check.  
   
  What content does Research AI provide?   
 In its initial release, Research AI delivers concise, written responses tailored to user queries, integrating statistics, infographics, diverse topics, and key insights from market research. Each answer highlights its sources for easy verification and deeper understanding. Beyond direct answers, Research AI suggests personalized follow-up questions to further explore insights. Additionally, it curates a selection of related content, offering users a comprehensive view based on their interests.  
   
  How can I access Research AI?   
 Initially, Research AI will be accessible to all users free of charge for the first two weeks following its launch. All you need to do is register for free. This introductory offer allows you to explore and utilize the full capabilities of Research AI without any immediate cost.  

  How reliable are the answers from Research AI?   
 Research AI delivers answers built upon carefully selected and validated content from a broad spectrum of credible sources, including Statista’s rich database of statistics and reports. Although the platform aims for accuracy, due to the way automated systems work, occasional inconsistencies or errors may naturally occur. We therefore recommend that users check the information against the original sources and critically scrutinize it before using the answers to make important decisions. This approach ensures a balanced and sensible use of the tool.  
   
  What types of content are used to generate my response?   
 Research AI crafts responses using a wide range of proprietary Statista data. This includes detailed descriptions and datasets from all available statistics, alongside information from topic pages, report pages, industry pages, and infographics. The tool also integrates key findings from Market Insights. However, it does not currently include data from Consumer Insights and Company Insights. This diverse content mix ensures that answers are well-rounded and informative, drawing from a comprehensive Statista database.  
   
  How many languages are supported by Research AI?   
 Research AI supports a wide variety of languages, including English, German, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Italian, leveraging the capabilities of Cohere and Claude 3 Sonnet, which are trained on over 100 languages. Response quality may vary by language due to differences in the amount of training data available. For optimal results, the tool responds in the language of the query, but if the quality is insufficient, it is recommended to use English due to its extensive training dataset.  

  What is the difference between Research AI and the Statista search?   
 Research AI and Statista search differ significantly in terms of technology and user experience. Powered by AI technologies such as Claude 3 Sonnet, Research AI uses semantic search and Cohere’s Large Language Model (LLM) for nuanced understanding and tailored, context-relevant responses. It interprets user intent to provide comprehensive answers from a vast dataset. In contrast, Statista search is a keyword-based tool for finding specific data points and content. The search provides a list of relevant content for the user to get closer to the insight.  
   
  Is data from the Company Insights and Consumer Insights products also included in Research AI?   
 In its initial version, Research AI does not incorporate data from the Company Insights and Consumer Insights products. For information specific to these areas, users are advised to utilize the dedicated tools provided for Company Insights and Consumer Insights directly.  
   
  How can I provide feedback or report an issue with Research AI?   
 To provide feedback or report an issue with Research AI, please utilize the integrated feedback feature within the platform. Your input is crucial to our ongoing efforts to improve the product, and we greatly appreciate your support and cooperation.

  Further details will be available soon.   

 Submissions  
 Submissions must be at most 27 pages using the Springer LNCS format, including title page and figures, but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following after the main body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read or review beyond the main body, and submissions are expected to be intelligible, and show sufficient scientific quality and depth, without the supplementary material.  
 The above in particular means that submissions are expected to present the core technical part of the result(s) in the main body  . Thus, the main body should allow the reader to understand and verify what is at the heart of the contribution, conceptually and technically; the supplementary material should be used mainly for tying up the loose ends, spelling out the less innovative parts, providing extensions/generalizations, etc.  
 The final published version of an accepted paper will be limited to 30 pages including references and is expected to closely match the submission. For further details, consult the paper submission page.  

 Review Process  
 Eurocrypt 2025 will operate a two-round review system with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions that will proceed to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to respond to the reviews. Furthermore, in cases where this is considered useful by the PC chairs and/or the reviewers, additional communication between authors and reviewers may be initiated (in both rounds).  
 The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews (early rejects) may be submitted to other conferences after the first round notification date.  
 In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account the rebuttal letters. The committee then makes the final decision of acceptance or rejection.  
 Early Withdrawal  
 Until final decisions have been made, authors can only withdraw their paper with the express approval of the program chairs.  
  
 PC Member Submissions  
 PC members and area chairs are restricted to submit either 1 single-author paper, up to 2 papers if at least one of them is with a co-author, or up to 3 papers if all are with co-authors and at least two are with student co-authors. The PC co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.

 The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at early stages of their careers, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by early-career researchers. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.  
  
 Stipends  
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. Furthermore, a limited number of stipends are available to students that are unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.  
  
 Artifacts  
 To encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on the IACR's artifact archive at artifacts.iacr.org. Please see the detailed call for artifacts.

  Travel & Venue Information  
 The conference venue  
 The conference will be held at Hotel RIU Plaza de España Madrid  . RIU Plaza de España Madrid is a 4-star hotel located in “Edificio España”  , a historical building in the heart of the city. The venue is within walking distance of some of Madrid's main landmarks such as the Gran Vía, Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real (Royal Palace), and Puerta del Sol as well as to green areas such as Parque del Oeste, Jardines de Sabatini, Campo del Moro and Madrid Río.  
 Affiliated events  
     
 The affiliated workshops  will be held in a different venue  , in a building of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), located at Plaza de Ciencias 3, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid. The venue is near the Ciudad Universitaria (line 6) metro stop. See here  for a map and directions.  
 See the map for the conference venue ( Google Maps link  ) and affiliated events ( Google Maps link  ) below.  

 Traveling to Madrid  
 By plane  
 Madrid's airport is called Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas and is situated in the east of Madrid, around 15 km from the city center. It consists of two separate hubs: the old one contains terminals T1, T2, T3 while the new hub contains terminals T4 and T4S. Metro line 8 connects the airport with the city, ending in Nuevos Ministerios, one of the main metro and Cercanías stations in Madrid. Note that when traveling from and to the airport by metro you need a supplement that can be added to your transport card from the same machines where the card is obtained. Alternatively, taxis have a flat rate from the airport to anywhere in the city center of 33€.  
  
 By train  
 Madrid is connected to other cities in Spain via high speed (AVE) trains. The main train stations in Madrid are Atocha (officially Madrid Puerta de Atocha Almudena Grandes) and Chamartín (officially Madrid - Chamartín - Clara Campoamor). In particular, Atocha has direct trains to and from big cities in the East and South of Spain such as Barcelona (2.30 h), Valencia (2 h) and Málaga (3 h). Atocha and Chamartín stations are both well connected to the venue via metro, see How to get to the venue below.  

 How to get to the venue  
 Given its central location, the hotel is extremely well connected by public transport (see Madrid public transport below). It is right next to the Plaza de España metro stop (lines 3 and 10) and surrounded by multiple bus stops.  
 From the Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport:  From any of the terminals, take metro line 8 towards Nuevos Ministerios. At the last stop (Nuevos Ministerios), change to metro line 10 towards Puerta del Sur and get off at Plaza de España. Travel time by metro is around 45 minutes from T4 (around 40 min from T1-T2-T3) while travel time by taxi is around 30-35 minutes in normal traffic.  
 From the train station:  depending on your train, you might arrive at Chamartín or Atocha train stations.  
 From Chamartín: | take metro line 10 towards Puerta del Sur and get off at Plaza de España. 
  From Atocha: | take metro line 1 towards Pinar de Chamartín until Sol. Then, change to metro line 3 towards Moncloa and get off at Plaza de España. 
   
 Madrid public transport  
 Madrid has an excellent public transport system that combines the following options:  
 Metro: | Madrid has 13 metro lines with a total length of 295 km and over 300 stations. Here you have access to the | metro map | and to a tool to | plan your journey | . The metro is fast, efficient, and inexpensive, with trains running from 6:00 am until 1:30 am. You can purchase single tickets or rechargeable travel cards at metro stations. These tickets are compatible with bus lines as well. 
  Cercanías: | is a commuter rail system that connects Madrid with the surroundings. It is also a faster way to move between specific train stops in the center of Madrid. Here you can access the | rail map | . 
  Bus: | Madrid has a comprehensive bus system with over 200 routes covering the entire city. You can plan your bus | journey here | . Buses run from 6:00 am until 11:30 pm, and you can purchase tickets from the driver or use a rechargeable travel card. The “Líneas Cero” 001 and 002 (do not confuse with lines 1 and 2) are free of charge and both pass close to the venue: line 001 in particular has a stop in Plaza de España and connects it with Atocha train station. There are also night buses running all night. Beware that large baggage may not be allowed inside. 
  BiciMad: | Madrid may not be as bike-friendly as other major European cities, but cycling is definitely possible. There exists an e-bike sharing scheme called BiciMad, with stations located throughout the city. You can purchase tickets via the BiciMad app.

  Further details will be available soon.   

 Submissions  
 Submissions must be at most 27 pages using the Springer LNCS format, including title page and figures, but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following after the main body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read or review beyond the main body, and submissions are expected to be intelligible, and show sufficient scientific quality and depth, without the supplementary material.  
 The above in particular means that submissions are expected to present the core technical part of the result(s) in the main body  . Thus, the main body should allow the reader to understand and verify what is at the heart of the contribution, conceptually and technically; the supplementary material should be used mainly for tying up the loose ends, spelling out the less innovative parts, providing extensions/generalizations, etc.  
 The final published version of an accepted paper will be limited to 30 pages including references and is expected to closely match the submission. For further details, consult the paper submission page.  

 Review Process  
 Eurocrypt 2025 will operate a two-round review system with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions that will proceed to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to respond to the reviews. Furthermore, in cases where this is considered useful by the PC chairs and/or the reviewers, additional communication between authors and reviewers may be initiated (in both rounds).  
 The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews (early rejects) may be submitted to other conferences after the first round notification date.  
 In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account the rebuttal letters. The committee then makes the final decision of acceptance or rejection.  
 Early Withdrawal  
 Until final decisions have been made, authors can only withdraw their paper with the express approval of the program chairs.  
  
 PC Member Submissions  
 PC members and area chairs are restricted to submit either 1 single-author paper, up to 2 papers if at least one of them is with a co-author, or up to 3 papers if all are with co-authors and at least two are with student co-authors. The PC co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.  

 Awards  
 The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at early stages of their careers, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by early-career researchers. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.  
  
 Stipends  
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. Furthermore, a limited number of stipends are available to students that are unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.  
  
 Artifacts  
 To encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on the IACR's artifact archive at artifacts.iacr.org. Please see the detailed call for artifacts.

 Welcome to EuroMPI'23  
 11-13 September 2023, Bristol, UK  
 In 2023, EuroMPI Conference will take place in Bristol on September 11-13, 2023. The conference will be co-located with the 19th International Workshop on OpenMP (IWOMP 2023)  that will be held on September 13-15,2023. The MPI Forum will also meet following the EuroMPI Conference.  
 The EuroMPI conference is the preeminent meeting for users, developers and researchers to interact and discuss new developments and applications of the Message Passing Interface (MPI). This includes new proposed concepts and extensions to the MPI standard, libraries and languages built on top of MPI, interfaces to other standards in parallel programming, applications and optimizations to new architectures and networks, novel algorithms, and tools, with particular focus on quality, portability, performance, and scalability. The annual meeting has a long, rich tradition, and has been held since 1994.  
 Through the presentation of contributed papers, posters and invited talks, the conference presents a complete overview of MPI, its current usage in the parallel programming landscape, and its future directions. The EuroMPI conference provides ample opportunities for attendees to interact and share ideas and experiences to contribute to the improvement and furthering of message-passing and related parallel programming paradigms.

 Call for Paper  
 EuroMPI 2023 will continue to focus on advancing the ubiquitous Message Passing Interface (MPI) model and specification of parallel programming. It will also encompass extensions and alternative interfaces for high-performance heterogeneous and hybrid systems, benchmarks, tools, parallel I/O, fault tolerance, and parallel applications using MPI and other interfaces.  
 EuroMPI 2023 will be hosted by the University of Bristol and will be co-located with IWOMP 2023 (September 13-15, 2023), with joint tutorials, and opportunities to interact between the two communities.  
 Through the presentation of full papers, position papers, posters, and invited talks, the meeting will provide ample opportunities for attendees to interact and share ideas and experiences to contribute to the improvement and furthering of message-passing and related parallel programming paradigms.  
 Having EuroMPI, IWOMP and the MPI Forum grouped together provides ample opportunities for attendees to interact and share ideas and experiences to contribute to the improvement and furthering of message-passing, shared-memory parallelism, and related parallel programming paradigms -- and their combined usage.  
 We invite high-quality, full paper submissions on all topics related to message-passing parallel programming with MPI and related or competing models. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Implementation Issues and Algorithms: Efficient and scalable implementations of message-passing constructs. 
  Architectures and systems: Towards exascale computing, efficient use of accelerators and other features of modern, large-scale systems, hardware-software interaction. 
  Programming models and paradigms for large-scale, parallel, distributed memory systems, hierarchical and hybrid models, partitioned global address space (PGAS) models. 
  Extensions to and shortcomings of MPI, alternative interfaces and solutions. 
  New, parallel (MPI-)I/O mechanisms optimizations. 
  Hybrid and heterogeneous programming with MPI and other interfaces. 
  Message passing interface support for data-intensive parallel applications. 
  Fault tolerance in message-passing implementations and systems. 
  MPI parallel programming in clouds and non-dedicated systems. 
  Applications and Performance. 
  Performance evaluation for MPI and MPI-based applications. 
  Automatic performance tuning of applications and implementations. 
  Verification of message-passing applications and protocols. 
  Applications using message passing, in particular in computational science and scientific computing. 
  Parallel algorithms in the message-passing paradigm. 
  Interactions between the message-passing library and runtime systems. 
  Papers will be reviewed for quality, originality, clarity, correctness, technical strength, and relevance to the topics of the meeting. Each paper will receive at least three reviews from members of the program committee. Reviews are blind  (but not double-blind); the names of the authors will be seen by the program committee.  
 Among the papers selected for presentation, a few of the best papers will, as has been the tradition for the last couple of years, be selected by the program committee and recommended for publication in a EuroMPI 2023 Special Issue of a Journal, more details about the journal special issue coming here soon. These papers will go through a separate round of reviews, and are intended as extended, more polished archival versions of the conference versions.  
 Papers that are not accepted for presentation as full papers may be recommended for short papers or poster presentations. Short papers and poster will be published informally on the website, but are not intended to appear in the regular conference proceedings. Even without official proceedings, we consider short papers and posters to be a good way to present early work to the community, which can lead to discussions, constructive feedbacks and collaboration opportunities.  
 Important Dates

 Dagstuhl-Seminar — Solving Problems on Graphs: From Structure to Algorithms   
   
 19 Jan 2025 - 24 Jan 2025 • Schloss Dagstuhl, Wadern, Germany   

 Organizer:   
   
 Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik   

 Abstract:   
   
 Many discrete optimization problems can be modelled as graph problems, leading to a long list of well-studied problems, which include graph partitioning, covering and packing problems, network design problems, width parameter problems, and so on. Most of these graph problems are computationally hard. However, this situation may change if we require the input to belong to some special graph class. This leads to two fundamental questions, which lie at the heart of our Dagstuhl Seminar: for which classes of graphs can a computationally hard graph problem be solved in polynomial time, and for which classes of graphs does the problem remain hard? In our seminar, we aim to discover new insights that lead to results for a whole range of problems rather than just for a single problem alone.   

 Topics:   
   
 Graph Algorithms, Graph Classes, Graph Containment, Relations, Parameterized Complexity, Width Parameters

 Random ergodic optimization   
   
 30 Jun 2025 - 11 Jul 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 Ergodic optimization is a general framework in dynamical system where an observable is understood through its minimum over the set of invariant probability measures. A measure that attained that minimum is called minimizing. The general question is to understand the set of minimizing measures and more generally the set of minimizing orbits. One possible approach is to see minimizing measures as ground states, that is as limits of Gibbs measures at zero temperature. Gibbs measures are eigensolutions of the Ruelle operator or the transfer operator. We intend to study such questions in the framework of skew products of dynamical systems where the base dynamics is random (ergodic and invertible) and the fiber dynamics is a composition of maps indexed by a random environment. The problem of optimizing an observable in a random environment is new and has not yet been studied.

  Best Paper Award  

 This page is under construction   
 Rusty Lusk Award for the Best Paper at EuroMPI/Australia 2024  
 The Best Paper Award at EuroMPI/Australia 2024 is named after Rusty Lusk.  
 Ewing "Rusty" Lusk (1943–2022) received his B.A. from the University of Notre Dame in 1965 and his PhD from the University of Maryland in 1970. He began his career as an assistant professor of mathematics at Northern Illinois University. He later moved to the Computer Science Department, where he eventually became a full professor and the department's acting chair. In 1982, Rusty joined Argonne National Laboratory as a computer scientist and later became a senior computer scientist and Argonne Distinguished Fellow. Along with Paul Messina and Jack Dongarra, Rusty was instrumental in founding Argonne's Advanced Computing Research Facility, which signaled the beginning of Argonne's commitment to parallel computing research. He also served as the director of the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne from 2005 to 2011.  
 Rusty was one of the founders of the MPI Forum. He chaired MPI-2, started the MPICH project with Bill Gropp, and was a close friend, collaborator, and mentor to many in the MPI community.  
 Rusty has said, "I think that the development of the MPI Standard is probably the most important thing that I have worked on. Developing a community standard in cooperation with vendors, computer scientists, and users was fascinating to participate in. The experience was social and technical and succeeded because of the many people who worked hard to achieve a common goal. It was then possible to work on implementation research for MPI to convince a broad range of people that the standard was efficient to implement and use. We realized that we would be impacting a whole generation of parallel programmers if we succeeded."  
 Without Rusty's influence, MPI wouldn't be what it is today.

 Madrid is the capital of Spain, and is home to the Spanish Royal family as well as the Spanish Government. It is a modern metropolitan city and an economical and industrial center of Spain, and, with its population of nearly 3,5 million people, is also the biggest city in Spain.  
  
  It is located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, and is surrounded by mountains and natural parks. Although it is located in the centre of the country, it has traditionally been the hub between different areas of Spain and is therefore connected to all major Spanish cities by train, road or air. The weather in Madrid varies a lot depending on the season (hot and dry in the summer).  
 The city is full of great monuments, like the royal palace, the Plaza Mayor or the many statuettes, and for people interested in art, the museums Del Prado, Reina Sofia or Thyssen have some of the most fantastic collections of famous Spanish painters like Velazquez, Goya, Picasso or Miro.

 Venice, June 30 - July 4, 2025  
 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy  
   
 Call For Papers  
  The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is the younger, more adventurous, and tastier sibling conference of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland" or "NorCal S&P") conference. It is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.  
 We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Conference Expectations  
 Since its inception, EuroS&P has been running as a single-track conference. We believe that maintaining the engagement and sense-of-community benefits that come from a single-track conference is very beneficial. At the same time, we expect that with the rising number of submissions, the time allocated to each will decrease more and more. Therefore, at the time of publishing the CfP, we can neither commit to a single-track conference nor to the length of presentations at the conference.  
 We aim for a review process that will be rigorous and thorough, resulting in the acceptance of every paper with scientific merit and sufficient value to the community, and incorporate a four-week revision opportunity in which the PC assists authors to try to get as many papers as possible to the level needed.  
 Revision Option  
 EuroS&P features the option to revise papers for which the program committee sees a path for revision that is likely to lead to acceptance, even though the initial submission was not considered acceptable. If authors who are invited to do so wish to submit a revised paper, they must do so within four weeks of the notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed by the same reviewers who reviewed the original submission. Neither acceptance with shepherding nor an invitation to submit a revised paper implies that eventual acceptance is certain.  
 New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses  
 Almost all major security and privacy conferences feature an author-response phase, sometimes including interactive exchanges between authors and reviewers. As chairs, we have experienced this process to be challenging for both authors and reviewers; authors need to fit their response into a short word limit and reviewers must untangle the answers to their questions from the dense responses. To improve on this, EuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely  focus on the questions as well as factual errors. To ensure timely responses, we will provide the reviews for all papers which advance to Round 2 and will subsequently give authors approx. three working days to respond to the initial Round 1 reviews. Then, after Round 2, authors will be provided with all additional reviews and can respond to the new ones. Note that papers rejected after Round 1 will not be able to provide responses.  
 With this change, we hope to improve on the communication between individual reviewers and authors, but also to provide reviewers to read the responses with the papers still fresh in their minds rather than weeks after submitting their Round 1 reviews.  
 Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews  
 The discussions about individual papers are conducted “behind closed doors” within the set of reviewers. In the best case, reviewers will leave a summary of the discussion visible exclusively to the authors. To facilitate more transparency in the process of accepting papers, EuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta review (accessible through the EuroS&P website) for each accepted paper. This meta review will outline the PC’s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate.  
 Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix "SoK:" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Paper Awards  
 Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards. The award finalists and winners will be announced at the symposium.  
 Important Dates  
 All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12h)   .  
  
 Research Papers | Registration deadline (incl. topics and abstracts) | 21 October 2024 (Monday) 
 Submission deadline | 24 October 2024 (Thursday)

 R2 Rebuttal period | 20 - 23 January 2025 (Monday to Thursday) 
 Author Notification | 13 February 2025 (Thursday) 
 Submission of revised papers | 20 March 2025 (Thursday)

 Camera-ready deadline | tentatively:  17 April 2025 (Thursday) 
 Conference | Venice, Italy | 30 June - 4 July 2025 

 Proactive Prevention of Harm  
 We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although risking to cause harm is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they addressed and mitigated such risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, and following responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement as to how the benefit of the research outweighs the potential harms, and how the authors have taken measures and followed best practices to ensure safety and minimize the potential harms caused by their research.  
 If the submitted research has potential to cause harm, and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB was consulted appropriately and that its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. We note that IRBs are not necessarily well-versed in computer security research and may not know the best practices and community norms in our field, so IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work. In particular, IRB approval is not sufficient to guarantee that the PC will not have additional concerns with respect to harms associated with the research.  
 We encourage authors to consult existing documentation, e.g., Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them  or the Menlo Report  and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the Tor Safety Research Board  . These can help in thinking about potential harms, and in designing the safest experiments and disclosure processes.  
 Open Science Expectations  
 Our expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. This means that, by default, all of the code, data, and other materials (such as survey instruments) needed to reproduce your work described in an accepted paper will be released publicly under an open source license. Sometimes it is not possible to share work this openly, such as when it involves malware samples, data from human subjects that must be protected, or proprietary data obtained under agreement that preclude publishing the data itself. All submissions must  therefore include a clear statement on Data Availability ( as a separate appendix which does not count towards the page limit  ) that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared. The Program Chairs will hold authors to the commitments made in their submissions, and papers that fail to satisfy these commitments may be removed from the conference.  
 Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission  
 All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (whether of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. The submission must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. References should only be blinded in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. This explicitly excludes hosting on Github (which may leak author identities) or Google Drive (which could leak reviewer identities). Instead, authors are encouraged to use services such Anonymous Github  . Contact the program chairs if you have any questions. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. Hence authors are required to ensure that the paper they submit does not, within reason, leak their identity.  
 However, the process of anonymous submission is considered to be cooperative, not adversarial. Authors should not put explicit clues to their identity in the paper or otherwise purposefully deanonymize themselves to reviewers. Authors who think disclosing revealing aspects of their identities or setting would be important for positioning the paper, should consult with the PC chairs on how to do this in their submission. Reviewers are trusted to not actively look for the identity of authors, for instance by searching the internet for the paper title. By policy, authors may post their paper to public "preprint" archives (including arxiv) before, during, or after the review period.  
 The Program Chairs will reject papers that, in their sole judgment, blatantly violate the requirement for author anonymity.  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to, and rejected from, another conference, authors may optionally submit a separate document containing the (anonymized, but otherwise unedited) prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper.  
 To avoid biasing reviewers, reviewers will only see the provided supplementary material after submitting their own review. Then, reviewers will be able to see the submitted previous reviews, and may revise their review as a result.  
 Page Limit and Formatting  
 Papers shall not exceed 13 pages of body text, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. The statement on Data Availability should be part of the appendix, and does not count towards the page limit. Reviewers are explicitly not expected to read the appendices while deciding whether to accept or reject the paper.  
 Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not "US Letter") using the IEEE conference proceeding template we supply eurosp-template.zip  Please do not use other IEEE templates.  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white.  
 Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection without review.  
 Conference Submission Server  
 Papers must be submitted at https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org  and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.  
 Publication and Presentation  
 Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference. We are expecting to hold an in-person conference and that authors will be able to travel to the conference to present their paper. In case this is not possible, at least one author still must register for the conference, but unless a replacement for the presenter can be found, the presentation will be skipped. Instead, EuroS&P will offer to link to a video presentation from its website.

 Proactive Prevention of Harm  
 We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although risking to cause harm is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they addressed and mitigated such risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, and following responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement as to how the benefit of the research outweighs the potential harms, and how the authors have taken measures and followed best practices to ensure safety and minimize the potential harms caused by their research.  
 If the submitted research has potential to cause harm, and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB was consulted appropriately and that its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. We note that IRBs are not necessarily well-versed in computer security research and may not know the best practices and community norms in our field, so IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work. In particular, IRB approval is not sufficient to guarantee that the PC will not have additional concerns with respect to harms associated with the research.  
 We encourage authors to consult existing documentation, e.g., Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them  or the Menlo Report  and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the Tor Safety Research Board  . These can help in thinking about potential harms, and in designing the safest experiments and disclosure processes.  
 Open Science Expectations  
 Our expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. This means that, by default, all of the code, data, and other materials (such as survey instruments) needed to reproduce your work described in an accepted paper will be released publicly under an open source license. Sometimes it is not possible to share work this openly, such as when it involves malware samples, data from human subjects that must be protected, or proprietary data obtained under agreement that preclude publishing the data itself. All submissions must  therefore include a clear statement on Data Availability ( as a separate appendix which does not count towards the page limit  ) that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared. The Program Chairs will hold authors to the commitments made in their submissions, and papers that fail to satisfy these commitments may be removed from the conference.  
 Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission  
 All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (whether of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. The submission must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. References should only be blinded in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. This explicitly excludes hosting on Github (which may leak author identities) or Google Drive (which could leak reviewer identities). Instead, authors are encouraged to use services such Anonymous Github  . Contact the program chairs if you have any questions. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. Hence authors are required to ensure that the paper they submit does not, within reason, leak their identity.  
 However, the process of anonymous submission is considered to be cooperative, not adversarial. Authors should not put explicit clues to their identity in the paper or otherwise purposefully deanonymize themselves to reviewers. Authors who think disclosing revealing aspects of their identities or setting would be important for positioning the paper, should consult with the PC chairs on how to do this in their submission. Reviewers are trusted to not actively look for the identity of authors, for instance by searching the internet for the paper title. By policy, authors may post their paper to public "preprint" archives (including arxiv) before, during, or after the review period.  
 The Program Chairs will reject papers that, in their sole judgment, blatantly violate the requirement for author anonymity.  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to, and rejected from, another conference, authors may optionally submit a separate document containing the (anonymized, but otherwise unedited) prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper.  
 To avoid biasing reviewers, reviewers will only see the provided supplementary material after submitting their own review. Then, reviewers will be able to see the submitted previous reviews, and may revise their review as a result.  
 Page Limit and Formatting  
 Papers shall not exceed 13 pages of body text, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. The statement on Data Availability should be part of the appendix, and does not count towards the page limit. Reviewers are explicitly not expected to read the appendices while deciding whether to accept or reject the paper.  
 Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not "US Letter") using the IEEE conference proceeding template we supply eurosp-template.zip  Please do not use other IEEE templates.  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white.  
 Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection without review.  
 Conference Submission Server  
 Papers must be submitted at https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org  and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.  
 Publication and Presentation  
 Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference. We are expecting to hold an in-person conference and that authors will be able to travel to the conference to present their paper. In case this is not possible, at least one author still must register for the conference, but unless a replacement for the presenter can be found, the presentation will be skipped. Instead, EuroS&P will offer to link to a video presentation from its website.

 Venice, June 30 - July 4, 2025  
 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy  
   
 Call For Papers  
  The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is the younger, more adventurous, and tastier sibling conference of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland" or "NorCal S&P") conference. It is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.  
 We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Conference Expectations  
 Since its inception, EuroS&P has been running as a single-track conference. We believe that maintaining the engagement and sense-of-community benefits that come from a single-track conference is very beneficial. At the same time, we expect that with the rising number of submissions, the time allocated to each will decrease more and more. Therefore, at the time of publishing the CfP, we can neither commit to a single-track conference nor to the length of presentations at the conference.  
 We aim for a review process that will be rigorous and thorough, resulting in the acceptance of every paper with scientific merit and sufficient value to the community, and incorporate a four-week revision opportunity in which the PC assists authors to try to get as many papers as possible to the level needed.  
 Revision Option  
 EuroS&P features the option to revise papers for which the program committee sees a path for revision that is likely to lead to acceptance, even though the initial submission was not considered acceptable. If authors who are invited to do so wish to submit a revised paper, they must do so within four weeks of the notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed by the same reviewers who reviewed the original submission. Neither acceptance with shepherding nor an invitation to submit a revised paper implies that eventual acceptance is certain.  
 New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses  
 Almost all major security and privacy conferences feature an author-response phase, sometimes including interactive exchanges between authors and reviewers. As chairs, we have experienced this process to be challenging for both authors and reviewers; authors need to fit their response into a short word limit and reviewers must untangle the answers to their questions from the dense responses. To improve on this, EuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely  focus on the questions as well as factual errors. To ensure timely responses, we will provide the reviews for all papers which advance to Round 2 and will subsequently give authors approx. three working days to respond to the initial Round 1 reviews. Then, after Round 2, authors will be provided with all additional reviews and can respond to the new ones. Note that papers rejected after Round 1 will not be able to provide responses.  
 With this change, we hope to improve on the communication between individual reviewers and authors, but also to provide reviewers to read the responses with the papers still fresh in their minds rather than weeks after submitting their Round 1 reviews.  
 Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews  
 The discussions about individual papers are conducted “behind closed doors” within the set of reviewers. In the best case, reviewers will leave a summary of the discussion visible exclusively to the authors. To facilitate more transparency in the process of accepting papers, EuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta review (accessible through the EuroS&P website) for each accepted paper. This meta review will outline the PC’s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate.  
 Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix "SoK:" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Paper Awards  
 Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards. The award finalists and winners will be announced at the symposium.

  Vision 

 32nd EuroSPI Conference  
 EuroSPI² 2025 (10 - 12 September 2025) will have 10 international thematic workshop streams supported by thematic topic communities and the ICSSP (International System and Software Process Association) conference will take place as a co-located partner event. Each thematic stream integrates both, research sessions and industry / applied science sessions. The thematic streams will be a mix of pitch talks provoking discussions, full presentations and panel discussions which will focus on specific questions of interest. 
  Thematic Workshop Sessions  
 EuroSPI² 2025, (10 - 12 September 2025), hosted by Riga Technical University, Riga, Latvia, will have international key notes as plenary sessions and thematic workshops integrating research and industry experience. Researchers present case studies and new research which can in future be considered by industry and in the workshops. Industry presents best practices from industry and discusses the approaches and methods with experts. The goal is to fertilize the cooperation between research and industry. Additionally we involve strategic EU projects to empower new directions and co-operations. 
  Social Events  
 We believe that networking and creating research and business relationships is important to create a sustainable community for improvement and innovation. While the conference offers ideas, presentations, discussions, knowledge during the day, the social talks after the conference are equally important to establish trust and partnerships. We also believe that Europe integrates many regions with different cultures and to build European trust based partnerships we need to learn about the culture of regions. So please join the networking space and social events. 
  Key Notes  
 Key notes are plenary sessions by key experts from industry or research. Key notes (if accepted) are used to create key statements in the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We have every year 5 key notes from leading industry and research. Please visit our key notes page and the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We also invite key industry at the EuroSPI technology day, please visit our technology day page and download the free available presentations. 
  Workshop Communities  
 The thematic workshops allow leading industry and research to attend EuroAsiaSPI not only for a conference but also for a dedicated topic based workshop/training event. These workshop are dealing with hot topics and contain key papers and interactive sessions with open discussions. Participants work with the speakers to elaborate key statements to follow up in the next years workshops. The thematic workshops will be published as separate chapters in the annual SPRINGER book in the CCIS series. 
  EuroSPI as a Hybrid Event  
 We will continue to use the advanced technology equipment and organise an onsite and online hybrid event using integrated sound, cameras and video streaming combined with technical and content moderator roles in each workshop. Since EuroSPI² 2020 we have organised this hybrid event very successfully and feedback from attendees encourage us to continue with this new approach. 
  Social Events  
 Europe has many different regional cultures and customs, and still we need to work together in the EU frameworks. Already at the start of EuroAsiaSPI² in 1994 it was decided to place the conference in a different region every year and that the local host organises social events that help us to learn about the hosting culture, the traditions, history and the local food. This has a large influence on what social events EuroAsiaSPI² offers.This year we will explore the famous Bamberger House at the entrance of the Luitpold park with classical music by price winning musicians, and a traditional Bavarian beer festival in Rosenheim. 
  EuroSPI² Target Groups  
 Join our Improvement Community to which more than 28 Nations have been contributed since 1994.  Functional safety and cybersecurity managers and engineers, quality managers, ASPICE & IATF 16949 & ISO 26262 assessors, ISO 21434 and cybersecurity assessors and experts, trainers and teachers, project managers, experienced mechatronic & system & SW engineers, architects, researchers, consultants, innovation & business & improvement managers, process engineers, test managers, gamification designers, automotive & medical device & aerospace & IT industry, ..

47. Conference EuroSys_0:
Overview  
  Welcome to the 20th edition of EuroSys!  
  EuroSys  is a premier conference on various aspects of systems software research and development, including its ramifications for hardware and applications.

  Participants  keep up-to-date with contemporary movements in software  engineering and related topics, with in-depth discussions during  EuroPLoP’s Writers’ Workshops.   

 Call for Pattern Papers  

 We encourage you to submit pattern papers on software-related topics, as well as other topics. EuroPLoP is open for synergies with other fields and therefore accepts up to 20% of pattern papers on non-computing topics. EuroPLoP accepts papers containing patterns or pattern languages, as well as  papers related to the theory and the practical application of patterns. EuroPLoP also accepts excerpts from Ph.D. theses or book projects. In the past, many book authors have submitted parts of their work to get feedback from the pattern community.  
 We particularly welcome submissions on the following topics (theory and practice):

 Paper submission deadline: February 3, 2025   

 Call for Focus Group Proposals  

 Do you have a pattern-related topic with the potential to spark a discussion? Focus Groups at EuroPLoP are an excellent opportunity to collaborate with other passionate pattern writers. They are 1 to 2 hour sessions, usually workshops, but you are welcome to experiment with different formats. Your submission should include a summary of the topic, outcomes you envision, a brief description of how you will organize the session, its time budget, and the required number of participants.  

 Focus Group Proposal submission deadline: May 16, 2025   

 Paper Submission Process  

 The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings will be published. After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd. This is an experienced pattern author, who will provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. Following several iterations of shepherding, your improved second draft will be reviewed again and accepted or rejected for the conference. On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published. The submission system is available under https://www.europlop.net/submission/  .  

 Paper Submission Format  

 The final submission for publication must be formatted using the two-column  ACM template  ,  but for the drafts and intermediate versions,  you can use any format. However, we encourage you to use the ACM format  right from the beginning to avoid layout problems in the end. If you don’t  intend to publish with ACM, you can choose whatever format you like. We  recommend 10 pages as a guideline and especially welcome shorter papers.  Longer papers are also possible but bear in mind that the writers’ workshop  might decide to focus only on a part of your paper. Have a look at the   introductory information pack  for examples.    

 EuroPLoP Values  

 High-quality feedback  
 All submissions will benefit from an iterative shepherding process prior to the conference: an experienced pattern author will give you  feedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. In Writers’  Workshops – the core of the conference – peers and experts will  discuss your paper. You will receive in-depth, constructive feedback  and insights to improve your paper further. If you wish, you may  complement your paper with alternative media (e.g., short video clips  linked from the paper) to get feedback on that format as well.   
 Share and learn  
 Patterns are an effective way to share knowledge about a domain. The interdisciplinary topics of the conference will provide you with new insights and inspiring ideas from other fields.  
 Theory and practice  
 EuroPLoP, with its creative and constructive atmosphere, attracts participants from both industry and academia. You will be part of a unique community of pattern book authors, researchers, and practitioners.  

 The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings will be published. After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd.  

 On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published.  
  
 The final submission for publication must be formatted using the Springer format, but you can use any format for the drafts and intermediate versions.

 We are looking forward to receiving your contribution!

 Venice, June 30 - July 4, 2025  
 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy  
   
 Call For Papers  
  The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is the younger, more adventurous, and tastier sibling conference of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland" or "NorCal S&P") conference. It is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.  
 We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Conference Expectations  
 Since its inception, EuroS&P has been running as a single-track conference. We believe that maintaining the engagement and sense-of-community benefits that come from a single-track conference is very beneficial. At the same time, we expect that with the rising number of submissions, the time allocated to each will decrease more and more. Therefore, at the time of publishing the CfP, we can neither commit to a single-track conference nor to the length of presentations at the conference.  
 We aim for a review process that will be rigorous and thorough, resulting in the acceptance of every paper with scientific merit and sufficient value to the community, and incorporate a four-week revision opportunity in which the PC assists authors to try to get as many papers as possible to the level needed.  
 Revision Option  
 EuroS&P features the option to revise papers for which the program committee sees a path for revision that is likely to lead to acceptance, even though the initial submission was not considered acceptable. If authors who are invited to do so wish to submit a revised paper, they must do so within four weeks of the notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed by the same reviewers who reviewed the original submission. Neither acceptance with shepherding nor an invitation to submit a revised paper implies that eventual acceptance is certain.  
 New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses  
 Almost all major security and privacy conferences feature an author-response phase, sometimes including interactive exchanges between authors and reviewers. As chairs, we have experienced this process to be challenging for both authors and reviewers; authors need to fit their response into a short word limit and reviewers must untangle the answers to their questions from the dense responses. To improve on this, EuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely  focus on the questions as well as factual errors. To ensure timely responses, we will provide the reviews for all papers which advance to Round 2 and will subsequently give authors approx. three working days to respond to the initial Round 1 reviews. Then, after Round 2, authors will be provided with all additional reviews and can respond to the new ones. Note that papers rejected after Round 1 will not be able to provide responses.  
 With this change, we hope to improve on the communication between individual reviewers and authors, but also to provide reviewers to read the responses with the papers still fresh in their minds rather than weeks after submitting their Round 1 reviews.  
 Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews  
 The discussions about individual papers are conducted “behind closed doors” within the set of reviewers. In the best case, reviewers will leave a summary of the discussion visible exclusively to the authors. To facilitate more transparency in the process of accepting papers, EuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta review (accessible through the EuroS&P website) for each accepted paper. This meta review will outline the PC’s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers  
 We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate.  
 Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix "SoK:" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Paper Awards  
 Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards. The award finalists and winners will be announced at the symposium.

 Proactive Prevention of Harm  
 We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.  
 Although risking to cause harm is sometimes a necessary and legitimate aspect of scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they addressed and mitigated such risks. This includes, but is not limited to, considering the impact of the research on deployed systems, understanding the costs the research imposes on others, safely and appropriately collecting data, and following responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement as to how the benefit of the research outweighs the potential harms, and how the authors have taken measures and followed best practices to ensure safety and minimize the potential harms caused by their research.  
 If the submitted research has potential to cause harm, and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB was consulted appropriately and that its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. We note that IRBs are not necessarily well-versed in computer security research and may not know the best practices and community norms in our field, so IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work. In particular, IRB approval is not sufficient to guarantee that the PC will not have additional concerns with respect to harms associated with the research.  
 We encourage authors to consult existing documentation, e.g., Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them  or the Menlo Report  and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the Tor Safety Research Board  . These can help in thinking about potential harms, and in designing the safest experiments and disclosure processes.  
 Open Science Expectations  
 Our expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. This means that, by default, all of the code, data, and other materials (such as survey instruments) needed to reproduce your work described in an accepted paper will be released publicly under an open source license. Sometimes it is not possible to share work this openly, such as when it involves malware samples, data from human subjects that must be protected, or proprietary data obtained under agreement that preclude publishing the data itself. All submissions must  therefore include a clear statement on Data Availability ( as a separate appendix which does not count towards the page limit  ) that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared. The Program Chairs will hold authors to the commitments made in their submissions, and papers that fail to satisfy these commitments may be removed from the conference.  
 Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission  
 All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (whether of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. The submission must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.  
 Anonymous Submission  
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. References should only be blinded in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. This explicitly excludes hosting on Github (which may leak author identities) or Google Drive (which could leak reviewer identities). Instead, authors are encouraged to use services such Anonymous Github  . Contact the program chairs if you have any questions. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.  
 The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. Hence authors are required to ensure that the paper they submit does not, within reason, leak their identity.  
 However, the process of anonymous submission is considered to be cooperative, not adversarial. Authors should not put explicit clues to their identity in the paper or otherwise purposefully deanonymize themselves to reviewers. Authors who think disclosing revealing aspects of their identities or setting would be important for positioning the paper, should consult with the PC chairs on how to do this in their submission. Reviewers are trusted to not actively look for the identity of authors, for instance by searching the internet for the paper title. By policy, authors may post their paper to public "preprint" archives (including arxiv) before, during, or after the review period.  
 The Program Chairs will reject papers that, in their sole judgment, blatantly violate the requirement for author anonymity.  
 Reviews from Prior Submissions  
 For papers that were previously submitted to, and rejected from, another conference, authors may optionally submit a separate document containing the (anonymized, but otherwise unedited) prior reviews along with a description of how those reviews were addressed in the current version of the paper.  
 To avoid biasing reviewers, reviewers will only see the provided supplementary material after submitting their own review. Then, reviewers will be able to see the submitted previous reviews, and may revise their review as a result.  
 Page Limit and Formatting  
 Papers shall not exceed 13 pages of body text, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. The statement on Data Availability should be part of the appendix, and does not count towards the page limit. Reviewers are explicitly not expected to read the appendices while deciding whether to accept or reject the paper.  
 Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not "US Letter") using the IEEE conference proceeding template we supply eurosp-template.zip  Please do not use other IEEE templates.  
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white.  
 Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements can be grounds for rejection without review.  
 Conference Submission Server  
 Papers must be submitted at https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org  and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.  
 Publication and Presentation  
 Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference. We are expecting to hold an in-person conference and that authors will be able to travel to the conference to present their paper. In case this is not possible, at least one author still must register for the conference, but unless a replacement for the presenter can be found, the presentation will be skipped. Instead, EuroS&P will offer to link to a video presentation from its website.
