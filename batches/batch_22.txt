 18th International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Data  
 23-25 August 2023  
  Calgary, Alberta, Canada  

 The International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Data 2023 (SSTD 2023) is the eighteenth event of a series of biannual symposia that discuss new and exciting research in spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal data management and related technologies with the goal to set future research directions. The primary focus of SSTD symposia is on original results in the areas of theoretical foundations, design implementation, and applications of spatial and temporal database technology. SSTD also welcomes experience reports from application specialists and the commercial community that describe lessons learned in the development operation, and maintenance of actual systems in practical and innovative applications. The goal is to exchange research ideas and results across academia, industry and government from diverse geographies, and career stages.  
 SSTD 2023 will be held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 23-25 August 2023.

 Important Dates  
 Submission deadline: 26 September 2024, 23:59 AoE 
  Rebuttal: 15-21 November 2024 
  Author Notification: 16 December 2024 
  Camera-ready version: mid-January 2025 
  Conference: 4-7 March 2025 
  Submissions  
 Format of submissions  
 Submissions should be made through EasyChair, using this submission link  .  
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or a full paper with at most 15 pages; this page limit excludes the title page, the references section, and a possible appendix. The title page should contain the title of the paper and the abstract, but no author information. The first section of the paper should start on the next page, and the appendix, if any, should also start on the next page after the bibliography.  
 In preparation of submissions, the usage of the LIPIcs style file is mandatory; no changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Please refer to LIPIcs author instructions  . Submissions submitted after the deadline will not be considered, and submissions not adhering to the expected format risk rejection without consideration of the content.  
 Submissions should be made to appropriate tracks. The PCs reserve the right to reassign a paper to a different track, if deemed necessary.  
 The extended abstract should contain a succinct statement of the considered issues and of their motivation, a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance, accessible to non-specialist readers. This should be followed by a rigorous derivation of the claimed results. Proofs omitted due to space constraints should be put into an appendix, to be read by the program committee members at their discretion. It is allowed and encouraged to provide the full version of the paper as the appendix.  
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed. PC members are allowed to submit their works as well, except for PC chairs.  
 Double-blind reviewing  
 As in the previous years, STACS 2025 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process: submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymised. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
 Conflicts of interest  
 Authors will be invited to give a list of persons with a Conflict of Interest (COI). A Conflict of Interest is limited to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes the author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent or recent collaborator (within last 3 years) who cannot objectively review your work. 
  If you are unsure about a conflict in which a reviewer may have positive bias towards your paper, we recommend erring on the side of not declaring it since PC members and sub-reviewers will be also asked if they feel that they can fairly evaluate your paper. If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a Conflict of Interest not listed above, then they can contact PC chairs. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. Authors will be asked to declare conflicts with PC members during submission, but an author can contact PC chairs directly if they have a conflict with an individual who is likely to be asked to serve as a subreviewer for the paper.  
 Rebuttal  
 There will be a rebuttal period for authors. Authors will receive the reviews of their submissions and have a few days to prepare and submit rebuttals. These rebuttals become part of the PC discussions, but entail no specific responses. Rebuttals will be handled through EasyChair.  
 Conference  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person, a possibility for remote presentation will be offered.  
 Proceedings  
 Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As usual, these proceedings will appear in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics ( LIPIcs  ) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. This guarantees perennial, free and easy electronic access, while the authors retain the rights over their work. With their submission, authors consent to sign a license authorizing the program committee chairs to organize the electronic publication of their paper, provided the paper is accepted.  
 The final camera-ready of each accepted paper should be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs guidelines  and taking reviewer comments into account. General instructions regarding the preparation of the camera-ready version and the style can be found at LIPIcs author instructions  . Notice that there is a limit of 15 pages for the main body of the final camera-ready, excluding the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, ...) and a brief appendix (of up to 5 pages) from this page limit. Any appendices to the initial submission were officially not under review and thus should not be included in the proceedings. In general, major new content can be added only if suggested by the reviewers. You are however more than welcome to have the proceedings paper link to the full version published elsewhere (e.g., on arXiv). The precise link to the full version may even be provided later, during author approval period (expected in February).  
 STACS Code of Conduct  
 STACS joined http://safetoc.org  . Registering for STACS 2025 thus requires that you agree to follow the Code of Conduct described below.  
 STACS is committed to be a respectful forum for its participants, free from any violence, discrimination or harassment of any nature. All STACS attendees are expected to behave accordingly.  
 If you experience or witness violence, discrimination, harassment or other unethical behaviour at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice and remedy through one or more of the following options:  
 Consult with the SafeToC advocates of STACS (named below). 
  Report to the conference chair, the PC chairs or the Steering Committee chair. 
  The chairs are entitled to remove registered participants from the conference (without refunding the conference fees) if they are deemed to pose an ethical risk to other participants. The conference chair may contact the local university committee dedicated to address violence, unethical behaviour or harassment of any kind. Besides having an appointment with the victim, this committee can assist with medical support and with taking legal action.

 Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers: March 31, 2025.  
   
 The 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025)  , sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory ( SIGACT  ), will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from Monday, June 23  to Friday, June 27  .  
 Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas.  
 Submission format:  Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see below)  , and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the "full version" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  
   
  Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
   
  STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing  , and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work…" but rather "We build on the work of…").  
   
  The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
   
  All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.  
   
  PC Member Submissions:  Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed.  
   
  Recommended Best Practices for References:  Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages.  
   
  Authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing "\cite{XYZ} show..." instead of "X et al. show". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \bibliographystyle{alpha} or \bibliographystyle{alphaurl}.  
 Conflict of Interest Policy:  The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see here  ) and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy  . Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
  If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate  affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate.  
 Submission Instructions:  Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing).  
 The submission server  is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.   
 It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:  The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions.  
 Presentation of Accepted Papers:  One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference. Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
  
 Dates and other relevant information:  
 Paper submission deadline:  Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST. There is no separate abstract submission deadline.  
   
  Notification date:  by email on or before February 1, 2025.  
   
  Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:  A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 31, 2025. The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the ACM Format  , and specifically the sigconf option. (LaTeX users, please use: \documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}). Additional instructions will be sent directly to the authors of accepted papers.  
   
  STOC talks:  Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025.  
   
 Publication date:  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Best Paper Award:  The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible. In addition to the standard COI-avoidance, the final designation process will be conducted by the subset of PC Members with no submission to the conference. Rules for the award can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html  .  
 Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:  A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission. To inform the program committee about a paper's eligibility, check the appropriate box in the web form on the submission server. The list of past winners can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/student.html  .  
 Access to Proceedings:  The committee intends to provide registered attendees with internet access to the Proceedings on a password-protected site that will be available from about two weeks before the conference until the end of the conference. Authors can opt out of this online distribution by contacting the program committee chair by March 19, 2025.  
 Student Travel Awards:  SIGACT provides travel awards to students without available support, and researchers from developing countries. More information on the award process will be posted later on.

10. Conference STOC_1:
Call for Papers  
 STOC 2025  
   
 June 23-27, 2025  
  Prague, Czech Republic  
  OREA Hotel Pyramida  
   
 Paper Submission Deadline: Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST.  
   
 Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers: March 31, 2025.  
   
 The 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025)  , sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory ( SIGACT  ), will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from Monday, June 23  to Friday, June 27  .  
 Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas.  
 Submission format:  Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see below)  , and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the "full version" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  
   
  Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  
   
  STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing  , and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work…" but rather "We build on the work of…").  
   
  The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
   
  All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.  
   
  PC Member Submissions:  Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed.  
   
  Recommended Best Practices for References:  Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages.  
   
  Authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing "\cite{XYZ} show..." instead of "X et al. show". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \bibliographystyle{alpha} or \bibliographystyle{alphaurl}.  
 Conflict of Interest Policy:  The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see here  ) and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy  . Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
  If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate  affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate.  
 Submission Instructions:  Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing).  
 The submission server  is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.   
 It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:  The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions.  
 Presentation of Accepted Papers:  One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference. Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
  
 Dates and other relevant information:  
 Paper submission deadline:  Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST. There is no separate abstract submission deadline.  
   
  Notification date:  by email on or before February 1, 2025.  
   
  Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:  A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 31, 2025. The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the ACM Format  , and specifically the sigconf option. (LaTeX users, please use: \documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}). Additional instructions will be sent directly to the authors of accepted papers.  
   
  STOC talks:  Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025.  
   
 Publication date:  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Best Paper Award:  The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible. In addition to the standard COI-avoidance, the final designation process will be conducted by the subset of PC Members with no submission to the conference. Rules for the award can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html  .  
 Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:  A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission. To inform the program committee about a paper's eligibility, check the appropriate box in the web form on the submission server. The list of past winners can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/student.html  .  
 Access to Proceedings:  The committee intends to provide registered attendees with internet access to the Proceedings on a password-protected site that will be available from about two weeks before the conference until the end of the conference. Authors can opt out of this online distribution by contacting the program committee chair by March 19, 2025.  
 Student Travel Awards:  SIGACT provides travel awards to students without available support, and researchers from developing countries. More information on the award process will be posted later on.

 STOC Best Paper Award  
 The following rules for the Best Paper Award at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing  (STOC) were developed by a committee consisting of Paul Beame, David Johnson, Prabhakar Raghavan, Eva Tardos and David Williamson (Chair). The committee developed the policy for FOCS. The same policy was adopted for STOC by the SIGACT Executive Committee, as announced in the STOC 2002 Business Meeting.  
 The Program Committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. 
  Each author on each of the selected papers will receive a certificate or plaque with the name of the award, the name of the paper, and the names of the authors of the paper, to be awarded at the Business Meeting that year. 
  The main criterion for selection is the same as for being a top-rated paper in the conference: introduction of a strong new technique, solution of a long-standing open problem, introduction and solution of an interesting and important new problem, etc. These are the characteristics associated with giving a paper the highest score. 
  Additionally, the committee should have substantial confidence in the correctness of the paper. While the committee may choose to accept papers to appear in the conference while lacking confidence that the paper is correct, such papers should not be recipients of the Best Paper Award. Since only abstracts are submitted to the conference, the committee may, after accepting a paper to the conference, inform the authors that the paper is being considered for the Award, and request additional details. It is suggested that the committee finalize its decisions on the Award in time to have the recipients listed in the proceedings of the conference. However, the committee may choose to use the time up until the conference itself to continue reviewing the papers. 
  The committee should verify that the final proceedings version of the paper meets the high promise of the submitted abstract. 
  If no paper meets the criteria above, then no award need be given. 
  If a paper qualifies for the Machtey/Lewin Best Student Paper Award, it should not be disqualified from being considered for the Best Paper Award, and vice versa; a paper meriting both Awards should be given both Awards.

  Camera-ready version: mid-January 2025 
  Conference: 4-7 March 2025 
  Submissions  
 Format of submissions  
 Submissions should be made through EasyChair, using this submission link  .  
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or a full paper with at most 15 pages; this page limit excludes the title page, the references section, and a possible appendix. The title page should contain the title of the paper and the abstract, but no author information. The first section of the paper should start on the next page, and the appendix, if any, should also start on the next page after the bibliography.  
 In preparation of submissions, the usage of the LIPIcs style file is mandatory; no changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Please refer to LIPIcs author instructions  . Submissions submitted after the deadline will not be considered, and submissions not adhering to the expected format risk rejection without consideration of the content.  
 Submissions should be made to appropriate tracks. The PCs reserve the right to reassign a paper to a different track, if deemed necessary.  
 The extended abstract should contain a succinct statement of the considered issues and of their motivation, a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance, accessible to non-specialist readers. This should be followed by a rigorous derivation of the claimed results. Proofs omitted due to space constraints should be put into an appendix, to be read by the program committee members at their discretion. It is allowed and encouraged to provide the full version of the paper as the appendix.  
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed. PC members are allowed to submit their works as well, except for PC chairs.  
 Double-blind reviewing  
 As in the previous years, STACS 2025 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process: submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymised. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
 Conflicts of interest  
 Authors will be invited to give a list of persons with a Conflict of Interest (COI). A Conflict of Interest is limited to the following categories:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes the author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent or recent collaborator (within last 3 years) who cannot objectively review your work. 
  If you are unsure about a conflict in which a reviewer may have positive bias towards your paper, we recommend erring on the side of not declaring it since PC members and sub-reviewers will be also asked if they feel that they can fairly evaluate your paper. If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a Conflict of Interest not listed above, then they can contact PC chairs. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. Authors will be asked to declare conflicts with PC members during submission, but an author can contact PC chairs directly if they have a conflict with an individual who is likely to be asked to serve as a subreviewer for the paper.  
 Rebuttal  
 There will be a rebuttal period for authors. Authors will receive the reviews of their submissions and have a few days to prepare and submit rebuttals. These rebuttals become part of the PC discussions, but entail no specific responses. Rebuttals will be handled through EasyChair.  
 Conference  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person, a possibility for remote presentation will be offered.  
 Proceedings  
 Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As usual, these proceedings will appear in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics ( LIPIcs  ) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. This guarantees perennial, free and easy electronic access, while the authors retain the rights over their work. With their submission, authors consent to sign a license authorizing the program committee chairs to organize the electronic publication of their paper, provided the paper is accepted.  
 The final camera-ready of each accepted paper should be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs guidelines  and taking reviewer comments into account. General instructions regarding the preparation of the camera-ready version and the style can be found at LIPIcs author instructions  . Notice that there is a limit of 15 pages for the main body of the final camera-ready, excluding the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, ...) and a brief appendix (of up to 5 pages) from this page limit. Any appendices to the initial submission were officially not under review and thus should not be included in the proceedings. In general, major new content can be added only if suggested by the reviewers. You are however more than welcome to have the proceedings paper link to the full version published elsewhere (e.g., on arXiv). The precise link to the full version may even be provided later, during author approval period (expected in February).

  Call For Papers   
   
 The 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025), sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT), will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from Monday, June 23 to Friday, June 27. Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas. Submission format: Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see below), and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the "full version" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified. Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing, and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work…" but rather "We build on the work of…"). The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions. PC Member Submissions: Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed. Recommended Best Practices for References: Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages. Authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing "\cite{XYZ} show..." instead of "X et al. show". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \bibliographystyle{alpha} or \bibliographystyle{alphaurl}. Conflict of Interest Policy: The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see here) and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy. Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories: Family member or close friend. Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. Person with the same affiliation. Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate. Submission Instructions: Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing). The submission server is scheduled to open on Oct. 1, 2024. It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline. ACM is moving to require ORCIDs for all authors. An ORCID is an identifier that uniquely identifies an author. It connects an author's work even if there are variations in the names used on different papers, ensuring that the author gets credit for all of their contributions. Using ORCIDs will help ACM administer the ACM OPEN program where universities get open-access publishing via a subscription, aid in identifying conflicts of interests, and support other publications processes. ORCIDs are easy to obtain; it takes less than a minute. Prior and Simultaneous Submissions: The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions. Presentation of Accepted Papers: One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference. Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.

 We study classical and quantum LDPC codes of constant rate obtained by the lifted product  
  construction over non-abelian groups. We show that the obtained families of quantum LDPC  
  codes are asymptotically good, which proves the qLDPC conjecture. Moreover, we show  
  that the produced classical LDPC codes are also asymptotically good and locally testable  
  with constant query and soundness parameters, which proves a well-known conjecture in  
  the field of locally testable codes.

  ABOUT 
  TABLEAUX 2023 
  CONTACT 
    
 Welcome!  
 Tableau methods have been found to be a convenient formalism for automating deduction in various non-standard logics as well as in classical logic. Areas of application include verification of software and computer systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its required inference engines, and system diagnosis.  
 The International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods  (TABLEAUX) brings together researchers interested in all aspects - theoretical foundations, implementation techniques, systems development and applications - of the mechanization of reasoning with tableaux and related methods.  
 TABLEAUX has been held every year since 1992. Starting in 1995, the proceedings have been published in Springer's LNCS/LNAI series.

 TACAS 2025  
 31st International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems  
   
 Scope  
 TACAS is a forum for researchers, developers and users interested in rigorously based tools and algorithms for the construction and analysis of systems.  
   
 The conference aims to bridge the gaps between different communities with this common interest and to support them in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, flexibility and efficiency of tools and algorithms for building systems.  
 Theoretical papers with clear relevance for tool construction and analysis as well as tool descriptions and case studies with a conceptual message are all encouraged. The topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to:  
 specification and verification techniques; 
  software and hardware verification; 
  analytical techniques for real-time, hybrid, or stochastic systems; 
  analytical techniques for safety, security, or dependability; 
  SAT and SMT solving; 
  theorem proving; 
  model checking; 
  static and dynamic program analysis; 
  testing; 
  abstraction techniques for modeling and verification; 
  compositional and refinement-based methodologies; 
  system construction and transformation techniques; 
  machine-learning techniques for synthesis and verification; 
  tool environments and tool architectures; 
  applications and case studies. 

 Important Dates  
   
 The important dates are available in the Joint Call for Papers  .  

 Submission Categories  
   
 TACAS accepts four types of submissions: research papers, case-study papers, regular tool papers, and tool demonstration papers.  
 Research Papers  identify and justify a principled advance to the theoretical foundations for the construction and analysis of systems. Where applicable, they are supported by experimental validation. Artifact evaluation for regular research papers is not mandatory but strongly encouraged.  
 We do not discourage authors of regular research papers to put their submission on arXiv (or similar repos). Yet, we strongly encourage authors to not put the work on arXiv (or similar repos) around 2 weeks before and after the submission deadline, because potential reviewers may be subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers.  
 Case-Study Papers  are full length case-studies that describe the application of techniques developed by the community to a single problem or a set of problems of practical importance, preferably in a real-world setting. Case-study papers must describe the problem of interest and its novelty. It must provide a detailed description of the case-study (or studies) and various related techniques to solve the problem of interest for the case-study application. Modeling aspects of the case-study must be discussed. The case-study paper must provide detailed results on the application of formal techniques and lead to a conclusion that could be of interest beyond TACAS (to the research community pertaining to the case study). Artifact evaluation is currently not mandatory for case-study papers but undergoing artifact evaluation is strongly encouraged.  
 Regular Tool Papers  are full length papers that describe a tool of interest to the community or a new version of the tool built using novel algorithmic and engineering techniques. Regular tool papers must describe tools of broad interest and utility to the TACAS community. The papers must clearly describe the problem to be solved, its importance, related work, the techniques used in the tool and their novelty, the construction of the tool, its unique features, discuss how the tool is used and present benchmarking of the tool including comparisons with other tools and previous versions of the tool. For tools from the industry, the description should be useful in allowing the community members to reproduce some of the key techniques or “tricks” in their own tools. All tool papers must undergo mandatory artifact evaluation.  
 Tool-Demonstration Papers  are short papers that demonstrate a new tool or application of existing tool on a significant and novel case-study. As such, tool demo papers will be accepted if the PC decides that they are sufficiently interesting and novel to the community. Artifact evaluation is mandatory for these papers.  

 Paper Submission  
 Submit paper   
   
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS  (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of TACAS 2025  .  
 The review process of TACAS 2025 is:  
 double-blind | for regular research papers. As such, authors of regular research papers must omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them. 
  single-blind | for case study papers, regular tool papers, and tool-demonstration papers. 
  The length  of regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers is limited to 16 pp llncs.cls (excluding the bibliography and appendices). The length of tool demonstration papers is limited to 6 pp llncs.cls (excluding the bibliography and appendices). Additional material can be placed in a clearly marked appendix, at the end of the paper. The reviewers are, however, not obliged to read such appendices. If the paper is accepted, a full version including the appendix should be made publicly available via arXiv or a similar platform.  
 TACAS 2025 allows at most four submissions per author.   
 Submissions not adhering to the formatting and length requirements specified above will be rejected immediately.   

 Conflict of Interest  
   
 Upon paper submission, authors are asked to declare their Conflict of Interest (COI) with TACAS 2025 PC members. A COI includes the following sources:  
 Family member or close friend. 
  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
  Person with the same affiliation. 
  Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
  Reviewer owes author a favour (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
  Frequent or recent collaborator (within last 5 years) cannot objectively review your work. If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a COI not listed above, then the author can contact TACAS 2025 PC chairs. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If an author is uncertain of COI, the author is encouraged to email TACAS 2025 PC chairs. 

 Paper Evaluation  
   
 All papers will be evaluated by the program committee (PC), coordinated by the PC chairs and aided by the artifact evaluation chairs. All papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity.  
 Reproducibility of results is of the utmost importance for TACAS. Therefore, we encourage all authors to include support for replicating the results of their papers. For theorems, this would mean providing proofs; for algorithms, this would mean including evidence of correctness and acceptable performance, either by a theoretical analysis or by experimentation; and for experiments, one should provide access to the artifacts used to generate the experimental data. Material that does not fit into the paper page limit may be provided as appendix and/or on a supplementary website (without violating double-blind submission requirements of regular research papers), with access appropriately enabled and license rights made clear. For example, the supplemental material for reviewing case-study papers and papers with experimental results could be classified as reviewer-confidential if necessary (e.g. if proprietary data are investigated or software is not open source).  
 TACAS 2025 will use rebuttal for selected submissions  (those in the grey zone).  

 Artifact Evaluation  
   
 TACAS 2025 implements mandatory artifact evaluation for regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions  . Authors of these submissions must submit the respective artifacts by October 24, 2024 (AoE). The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 TACAS 2025 also implements a voluntary artifact evaluation for regular paper and case study paper submissions  . Authors of these submissions are encouraged to submit their respective artifacts. The artifacts will be evaluated post-paper-acceptance, provided the submission has been accepted as a regular paper or case study paper at TACAS 2025. Authors of accepted regular/case-study papers may revise/submit their artifact for evaluation shortly (in one week time and not longer than January 9, 2025) after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the voluntary artifact evaluation will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 Details on artifacts and their evaluation criteria  are available on the artifacts page  .  

 Artifact Submission  
   
 Artifact submission is handled via EasyChair  . After the paper submission deadline, the paper submission will be copied by us from the main track to the artifact evaluation track. In this track, you should amend your submission’s abstract and upload a ZIP archive containing your artifact. Do not attempt to create a new submission, nor change your submission’s other details such as authors or title. Because of this copying process, you can upload or update your artefact either in the main track before the paper submission deadline or in the AE track during a window before the deadline. The TACAS PC or AEC chairs will inform authors when the AE track is open for different paper categories.  

 Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP)  
   
 TACAS 2025 will host the 14th instance of the Competition on Software Verification, SV-COMP  .

 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States.

 History  
   
 The ITP conference series is dedicated to interactive theorem proving and related topics, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification security, and formalization of mathematics. The inaugural meeting of ITP was held on 11 to 14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9 to 21 July 2010). ITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009.  
 The TPHOLs Conference Series  
 TPHOLs 2009 was the twenty-second in a series of international conferences on the applications of higher-order logic theorem proving. The first three (two at Cambridge and one at Århus) were informal users' meetings for the HOL system and were the only ones without published papers. Between 1991 and 1995 (Davis, Leuven Vancouver, Malta, Utah) the conference entertained an increasingly wide field of interest.  
 The evolution resulted in the program committee for the meeting in Turku (1996) deeming that the scope of the conference included all reasoning tools for higher-order logics and adopting the name TPHOLs, an acronym for Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics. (The final letter was considered necessary to break the direct connection between the conference and the HOL system.) This decision was strongly endorsed at the business sessions at Turku and Murray Hill (1997).  
 Traditions  
 A long-standing convention is that the annual conference should be held in a continent different to the location of the previous meeting. Another tradition is that the organizers for each meeting handle all aspects of the conference for the whole year in consultation with the previous few organizers. This includes selection of the program committee, editing the proceedings fund-raising, program, and local arrangements. Another responsibility of the organizers in year n  is to call for bids and conduct a poll for the selection of the venue for the conference in year n  + 1.

  Nominees and Results of the CADE Trustee Elections  
 Philipp Rümmer    
  Secretary of CADE Inc.   
 The affairs of CADE are managed by its Board of Trustees. This includes the selection of CADE (IJCAR) co-chairs, the selection of CADE venues, choosing the Herbrand, Bill McCune, and Skolem Award selection committee instituting new awards, etc.  
 The members of the board of trustees until the 2024 elections were:  
   
 Christoph Benzmüller | (IJCAR 2024 program co-chair) 
  Jasmin Blanchette | (elected 2023) 
  Pascal Fontaine | (reelected 2022) 
  Carsten Fuhs | (elected 2023) 
  Jürgen Giesl | (president, elected 2022) 
  Neil Murray | (treasurer 1992) 
  Cláudia Nalon | (elected 2021) 
  André Platzer | (elected 2022) 
  Philipp Rümmer | (secretary 2018) 
  Renate Schmidt | (vice president, reelected 2023) 
  Stephan Schulz | (reelected 2021) 
  Sophie Tourret | (elected 2022) 
   
 The terms of the elected trustees Cláudia Nalon and Stephan Schulz ended in 2024. The term of office of Christoph Benzmüller as IJCAR 2024 program co-chair ended after the IJCAR conference, and Uwe Waldmann is joining the board of trustees as CADE-30 program co-chair.  
 In the 2024 elections, two new trustees had to be elected.   
 The following candidates were nominated and their statements, in alphabetical order, are below:  
 Marijn Heule | , nominated by Cesare Tinelli and Armin Biere 
  Cláudia Nalon | , nominated by Pascal Fontaine and Renate Schmidt 
  Martin Suda | , nominated by Geoff Sutcliffe and Stephan Schulz 
  The election was carried out using the Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS)  , and the Condorcet completion Minimax-PM. Participants of the last three CADE/IJCAR conferences (who paid registration fees at at least one of the conferences) were invited to vote, and a total of 262 ballots were sent out on August 28. By September 15, 79 CADE members had voted through CIVS which translates to a participation rate of 30.2% (as compared to 26.2% in 2023, 26.7% in 2022, 26.7% in 2021, 34.5% in 2019, 21.1% in 2018, 9.1% in 2017, 11.2% in 2016).  
 The results of the election can be viewed on CIVS  :   
 Marijn Heule: | Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices; 
  Martin Suda: | loses to Marijn Heule by 43–29; 
  Cláudia Nalon: | loses to Marijn Heule by 44–27, loses to Martin Suda by 43-30. 
   
 The two candidates elected are Marijn Heule and Martin Suda.   
 The new board of trustees is therefore:   
 Jasmin Blanchette | (elected 2023) 
  Pascal Fontaine | (reelected 2022) 
  Carsten Fuhs | (elected 2023) 
  Jürgen Giesl | (president, elected 2022) 
  Marijn Heule | (elected 2024) 
  Neil Murray | (treasurer 1992) 
  André Platzer | (elected 2022) 
  Philipp Rümmer | (secretary 2018) 
  Renate Schmidt | (vice president, reelected 2023) 
  Martin Suda | (elected 2024) 
  Sophie Tourret | (elected 2022) 
  Uwe Waldmann | (CADE-30 program co-chair) 
   
 On behalf of CADE Inc., I would like to thank Cláudia Nalon and Stephan Schulz for their service for CADE over the last three resp. six years, and Cláudia Nalon for running in the 2024 elections. I would like to congratulate Marijn Heule and Martin Suda, who will join the board as new elected trustees.  
 Nominee statement of Marijn Heule  
 CADE and IJCAR, along with SAT, are my favorite conferences due to their stimulation of exciting and important research. Since 2012, I have had the pleasure of participating in most CADE and IJCAR conferences and serving on several of their program committees, including co-chairing IJCAR'24. Additionally, I was honored to serve as a trustee from 2017 to 2022.  
 My research focuses on two significant challenges in automated deduction: validating the correctness of complex techniques developed by the community and leveraging the power of large computer clusters. Although my work primarily targets SAT and QBF solving, these challenges are also crucial for first-order logic and beyond. I am particularly interested in promoting the application of successful techniques from propositional logic to richer logics.  
 The community has developed powerful tools such as CaDiCaL, Vampire, and Z3, which have also found success in industry. I support encouraging paper submissions that demonstrate the impact of these tools on solving relevant problems, as such papers can have a broad impact. Furthermore, I advocate for the requirement that experimental evaluations be reproducible by reviewers and the wider community.  
 I strongly believe that all future publications in automated reasoning, including CADE/IJCAR proceedings and JAR articles, should be Open Access. This approach enhances accessibility and can expand the community. Although there are concerns about the financial impact on authors and participants, I believe we can address these through sponsorships and agreements with funding agencies. I favor using LIPIcs for conference proceedings over LNCS, due to ongoing issues with Springer, including typesetting. A recent community survey showed overwhelming support for LIPIcs, and as a trustee, I will push to implement this change.  
 The current structure of alternating yearly between CADE and IJCAR and joining FLOC every four years strikes the right balance between focusing on our community and maintaining visibility with related communities. I support coordinating the locations of CADE/IJCAR/FLOC conferences to improve geographic distribution. Despite most CADE attendees being from Europe, I am committed to encouraging participation from North American researchers. Thus, it is important to continue organizing CADE/IJCAR regularly in the US or Canada.  
 Nominee statement of Cláudia Nalon  
 I am honoured and excited to be nominated once again to serve on the CADE's Board of Trustees. I have actively participated in both CADE and IJCAR for many years. I contributed both research and tool papers to either conference served as a PC member several times, and helped with the organisation of the first edition of CADE in South America. I also have experience as a PC member, chair, SC member and organiser for other conferences in our field.  
 My research is focused on both the theoretical foundations and practical aspects related to the implementation of proof methods for non-classical logics and their combinations. CADE and IJCAR are (and should remain) welcoming venues for research encompassing a broad range of logics and techniques. I feel at home here and I am deeply committed to this community. As an enthusiastic implementer, I advocate for the increase of submission numbers of system and tool papers, and for introducing demo sessions for tools at the conference. This is not only important in my field but more generally, as it encourages and celebrates the hard work of producing these tools.  
 I very strongly believe that a better geographical distribution of conference sites for CADE would be beneficial to our community. It will help to stimulate research and disseminate knowledge about automated reasoning and also attract talented individuals from regions that are not well represented in our field at present. We need to be sensitive to the fact that in those areas funding is often not available, and both researchers and students may have difficulties with meeting travel expenses and registration fees. I therefore support continuing the Bledsoe Award, to support students, and exploring options for reduced registration fees.  
 Costs are important. I support maintaining open access to the CADE proceedings to ensure the broad dissemination of our research. Open access is not for free, though, and we need to be mindful of what serves our community best and carefully evaluate cost-effective options. The consultation made by the current Board of Trustees already gives us a direction. However, it is also crucial to consider the impact of any changes to our sister conferences, TABLEAUX and FroCoS, which we join every two years to form IJCAR. I support therefore that we continue with discussions with their steering committees, as decided in our recent meeting in Nancy, before making any decision.  
 Thank you for considering my nomination. I am looking forward to the opportunity to continue contributing to our community.  
 Nominee statement of Martin Suda  
 I am honored to be nominated for the CADE Board of Trustees. CADE-22 (Montreal, 2009) was my very first serious conference and, with one exception, I took part at CADE and IJCAR ever since. I have served on the program committee of these conferences for the last six years. Since 2023, I am also a member of the steering committee of CADE's sibling FroCoS.  
 My current primary research interest is automated theorem proving and how it can be boosted through the techniques of machine learning. In the past, I also worked on temporal reasoning, SAT/QBF, and model finding. I am one of the main developers of the award-winning automatic theorem prover Vampire.  
 I am generally happy with the scope of CADE, catering for a wide range of topics, for both theoretical papers and those with focus on implementation. I like the regular merging with neighboring conferences on even years, which ensures we keep close contact with related fields. I also more than agree with the continuous support of young researchers, be it in the form of the Woody Bledsoe Student Travel Award, the Bill McCune PhD award, or in organizing the SAT/SMT/AR summer school.  
 The transition to the open access publication model was a step in the right direction. However, I believe that lower publication fees and less copy editing from the side of the publisher would improve our situation further. I understand that some funding agencies or career promotion committees may regard LNCS as prestigious, while they have not heard of LIPIcs yet, but that is a separate battle that we should fight elsewhere. For instance, by making sure CADE maintains or even improves on its current CORE ranking.

 EuroProofNet Workshop: Theorem Proving and Machine Learning in the age of LLMs: SoA and Future Perspectives   
 April 7-8, 2025, Edinburgh, UK   
 Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be very successful in programming and translation talks, and creates new opportunities combining AI with proofs. Recently, various claims have been made that large language models (LLMs) will revolutionise these areas. However, many questions about the details of the applications of LLMs and their impact on theorem proving and mathematics remain open. At the workshop, we want to bring together researchers from a wide range of communities: mathematics, automated and interactive theorem proving, machine learning, natural language processing, and formal methods, in order to discuss the state-of the-art and future directions for this new area of research.  
 Examples of topics that we intend to discuss include, but are not limited to:  
 ML/LLM for Advancing Proof Techniques, e.g., tailoring LLMs to theorem-proving datasets and benchmarks combining neural networks and symbolic reasoning for robust theorem proving, enabling LLMs to learn proof techniques from minimal data or prior examples. 
  Applications of ML/LLM in Theorem Proving, e.g., designing co-pilot systems for theorem provers like Coq Lean, or Isabelle, auto-formalising mathematical concepts and proofs from textbooks or research papers, human-machine collaboration workflows in proof construction. 
  Challenges and Limitations of ML/LLM in Theorem Proving, e.g. addressing hallucinations and errors in proofs generated by LLMs, handling large and complex proof spaces with LLM-guided tools, mitigating biases introduced during LLM training on specific mathematical domains. 
  Benchmarks and Evaluation for ML/LLM in Theorem Proving, e.g., creating datasets specifically for evaluating LLM-based theorem proving systems, assessing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM-generated proofs defining success metrics for proof assistance beyond correctness, such as creativity and accessibility. 
  Interdisciplinary Impact of ML/LLM, e.g., leveraging LLMs to teach formal methods, logic, and theorem proving to students, using LLMs to explore conjectures and new areas of mathematical research, applications in formal verification for software, hardware, and systems engineering, including industrial applications. 
  Future Directions for ML/LLM in Theorem Proving: e.g., the implications of relying on AI systems for critical mathematical proofs, setting open standards for the integration of LLMs in the theorem-proving workflows speculating on the evolution of LLMs and their roles in formal reasoning. 
  Cross-Domain Connections: e.g., developing user-friendly natural language interfaces for proof assistants adapting LLM capabilities from general domains to formal logic and proofs.

 Special Issue on Recent Advances on Unification   
 The Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming (JLAMP) is an international journal that complements Elsevier's Science of Computer Programming and Theoretical Computer Science by its focus on the foundations and the application of logical, algebraic and categorical methods to programming and to the development of trustworthy computing systems. The aim of JLAMP special issues is to attract high-quality research papers in specific topics connected to logical and algebraic methods in the theory and practice of software development and computing systems.  
 The purpose of this special issue of JLAMP is to collect recent, original and high-quality contributions on unification theory and its applications as well as closely related topics. Unification is concerned with the problem of making two given terms equal, either syntactically or modulo an equational theory. It is a fundamental process used in various areas of computer science including automated reasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural language processing, program analysis, knowledge representation, types, etc.  
 The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is the main international event on unification. This special issue is related to the research presented in the last four editions of the workshop, i.e., from UNIF 2021 to UNIF 2024. Nevertheless, submissions of high quality works on unification that were not presented at UNIF are also welcome. Thus, participants of UNIF, as well as other authors, are invited to submit contributions.  
 Following the tradition of UNIF, this special issue addresses the topic of unification in a broad sense. A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:  
 Syntactic and equational unification algorithms 
  Matching and constraint solving 
  Higher-order unification 
  Unification in modal, temporal, and description logics 
  Admissibility of inference rules 
  Narrowing 
  Disunification 
  Anti-unification 
  Complexity issues 
  Combination methods 
  Implementation techniques 
  Applications 
   
 Submitted manuscripts should be written in English and prepared following the guidelines of JLAMP. Papers should be submitted electronically by using the Editorial Manager for JLAMP  . Please choose VSI:Recent Advances in Unification  when you will be selecting the article type.  
 The submission deadline is: February 15, 2025  .

 Tenure-track Assistant Professorship, Lund University, Sweden  
 The Department of Computer Science at Lund University invites applications for a tenure-track assistant professorship in the foundations of computer science with a focus on logic and automated reasoning.  
 The assistant professor will be working at the Department of Computer Science, where research into the foundations of computer science is conducted by professors Susanna de Rezende and Jakob Nordstrom. Jakob Nordstrom leads the research group Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization  , which is also active at the University of Copenhagen. The research has a unique profile in that it spans a wide range of questions from the theoretical mathematical foundations of efficient computation all the way to state-of-the-art practical algorithms for real-world problems. This creates a very special environment, where the research projects do not only go deep into different theoretical and applied topics, but where different lines of research cross-fertilise each other and unexpected and exciting synergies often arise.  
 This position focuses on algorithms for foundational problems within logic, automated reasoning, and combinatorial optimization. This includes design and implementation of algorithms for computational problems within Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, constraint programming, mixed integer linear programming, and/or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving. In addition to algorithm construction another topic of interest is to develop a scientific understanding of the practical performance of automated reasoning algorithms, and to investigate relations between empirical observations and theoretical results in algorithm analysis and computational complexity theory. Yet another related area concerns methods of ensuring that algorithms compute provably correct results, which can be used to develop trustworthy solvers for automated reasoning and combinatorial optimization.  
 The application deadline is January 8, 2025  . See here  for more information and instructions how to apply. Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to Jakob Nordström  .

  (Sample) Topics  
 Here are some sample topics (as of March 2022). Don’t worry too much about the desired qualifications–you can learn them after enrollment.  
 Categorical foundations of formal verification via coalgebras and fibrations  
 Fixed-point specifications (such as in LTL and modal \mu-calculus) have been conventionally studied in terms of finitary and combinatory structures (automata, games, etc.). These observations are recently being transferred to more abstract settings, opening up algorithms and proof methods for new application domains (esp. probabilistic, metric, etc.). There are a number of research questions waiting to be answered, both theoretical and algorithmic.  
 References: [Komorida, Katsumata, Hu, Klin, Hasuo, LICS’19], [Komorida, Katsumata, Kupke, Rot, Hasuo, LICS’21], [Kori, Hasuo, Katsumata, CONCUR’21], [Watanabe, Eberhart, Asada, Hasuo, MFPS’21]  
 Desired qualifications: familiarity with mathematical and abstract reasoning used in logic, lattice theory and (possibly) category theory  
 Logical guidance in optimization metaheuristics  
 Many real-world optimization problems have inherent logical and discrete structures, but many optimization metaheuristics (stochastic optimization, hill-climbing, evolutionary computation, etc.) do not make explicit use of such strucstructures. We have used hierarchical optimization frameworks where the upper logical layer guides the lower metaheuristics layer for efficiency and explainability. The goal is to push the idea further in other applications and theoretical foundations.  
 References: [Zhang, Hasuo, Arcaini, CAV’19], [Zhang, Ernst, Sedwards, Arcaini, Hasuo, EMSOFT’18]  
 Desired qualifications: familiarity with 1) formal logic, 2) optimization metaheuristics, 3) statistical machine learning  
 Combining local and global propagation in quantitative model checking  
 We are especially interested in value iteration  , a family of approximate algorithms for quantitative model checking. Usual algorithms with only local propagation face certain challenges, and we have recently shown that those challenges are efficiently mitigated by mixing the right choice of global propagation. The goal is to push the idea further, to other problems, and to the formalization of theoretical foundations.  
 Reference: [Phalakarn, Takisaka, Haas, Hasuo, CAV’20]  
 Desired qualification: familiarity with model checking (see e.g. [Baier & Katoen ’08]), logic and automata. Familiarity with graph-theoretic algorithms is appreciated, too  
 Logical safety for automated driving  
 Responsibility-sensitive safety (RSS)  is a recently proposed methodology for devising mathematically-guaranteed safety rules for automated driving. The candidate will work on its logical foundations and its application to various driving scenarios. The work is much like interactive theorem proving, but with unique theoretical challenges (e.g. continuous dynamics) and a hot application (automated driving).  
 References: [Shalev-Shwartz, Shammah, Shashua, arXiv’17] (our goal is to make the theory logically well-grounded)  
 Desired: familiarity with formal logic and interactive theorem proving, interest in bringing theory to practice  
 Practical formal verification of IoT security  
 In the context of the CREST ZT-IoT project  , we aim at a practical proof-guided workflow for ensuring security of IoT systems. We do so by combining techniques for formal verification of security protocols with ideas from light-weight formal methods (model-based testing, runtime monitoring, etc.). We are in close collaboration with system software researchers who know a lot about, and will build, actual IoT systems.  
 Desired: familiarity with formal logic, and eagerness to learn from real-world applications and problems  
 Interested?  
 Contact Ichiro Hasuo i.hasuo <at> acm.org 
  When you do so, please include material that would speak for your capabilities and qualifications. Published/unpublished papers, reports, grades, a list of books and articles you have read, etc. 
  Please clarify which you’re thinking of: 5-year course (you enroll after BSc) or 3-year course (you enroll after MSc) 
  I will reply if the relevance is seen to be big enough

 SYNASC 2024 International Symposium – Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing – 26th edition    

 UVT newsletter 

 SYNASC 2024 International Symposium – Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing – 26th edition  

 October 1, 2024 
  11:18 am 

 Between September 16-19, the 26th edition of the SYNASC International Symposium took place ( https://synasc.ro/2024/  ) organized by the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in collaboration with the Institute of Symbolic Computing of the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria and the e-Austria Institute in Timișoara.  
 This year's edition was attended by 110 researchers from 23 countries who presented theoretical and applied results in the field of symbolic and numerical computation, mathematical logic, programming, theoretical foundations of computer science, distributed computing and artificial intelligence.  
 The SYNASC Symposium is recognized nationally and internationally as a scientific event that sets a high bar in terms of the quality of the papers. The evaluation of the works is done by an international program committee coordinated every year by an internationally recognized specialist. This year, the scientific coordinator of the symposium was Prof. dr. Fairouz Kamereddine  from University of Edinburgh, UK  . Since 2005, the selected and presented papers are included in a volume published by CPS (Conference Publishing Systems) and submitted for indexing in WoS, Scopus, etc.  
 The program of each of the 4 days of the symposium included guest presentations given by leading researchers from the country and abroad. At this edition, the following were invited to give plenary presentations: Kadi Bouatouch (University of Rennes, France), Mike Preuss (University of Leiden, Netherlands), Sasa Radomirovic (University of Surrey, UK), Amr Sabry (Indiana University, USA), Dan Tufiš (Romanian Academy).  The participants thus had the opportunity to learn about the latest research directions in various fields related to the theme of the symposium: formal methods in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, statistical models applied in graphics and artificial vision, multicriteria optimization applied in chemistry, cyber security with applications in the implementation of electronic voting systems, ethical aspects in artificial intelligence.   
 In addition to these presentations, three tutorials were included in the program, mainly addressed to young researchers, supported by Carlos Cano Domingo (Barcelona Supercomputing Center), Andrei Alexandru (Romanian Academy) and Gabriel Ciobanu (Romanian Academy)  .   
 In addition to the sessions dedicated to the main sections of the symposium, 4 workshops were held on related topics (agent systems for solving complex problems, iterative methods in determining fixed points, nature-inspired computing and applications of serious games) and two special sessions ( one dedicated to doctoral students and one oriented towards the computational methods used to model the transition to a clean energy). The workshops as well as the session dedicated to the IT industry allowed the establishment of contacts and collaborations between researchers from the academic environment and researchers from the industrial environment. In the session dedicated to doctoral students, two prizes were awarded for the best papers in the field of theoretical informatics (Rareș Mateiu, University of Bucharest) and in the field of artificial intelligence (Ariana Șerpar, West University of Timișoara).  
 In parallel with SYNASC 2024, the eighth edition of the Working Formal Methods international symposium (FROM 16 – https://from18.uvt.ro/), a traveling symposium hosted periodically by the universities of Bucharest, took place between 2024-2024 September. Cluj-Napoca, Iasi and Timisoara. The symposium brought together researchers and practitioners of formal methods to present new theoretical results, methods, techniques and frameworks, as well as software tools that facilitate the application of formal methods and build on the presented theoretical results. The symposium program included 2 invited presentations, 4 tutorials and 11 presentations of peer-reviewed papers. Guest presentations and tutorials were delivered by Nikolaj Bjorner (Microsoft Research, USA), Isabela Drămnesc (West University of Timișoara), Mădălina Erașcu (West University of Timișoara)  , Laura Kovacs (Technical University of Vienna, Austria), Vlad Rusu (INRIA Lille, France), Andrei Voronkov (University of Manchester).   
 SYNASC 2024 benefited from the support, as sponsors, of some companies in the IT field among which we mention: CyberThor Studios, Continental, Nokia, ETA2U, Forvia Hella, CyberBee Software and MemIQ.

The proceedings volumes will appear in gold open access, so the published versions of all papers will be available for everyone to download from the publisher’s website freely from the date of online publication, perpetually. The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors.  
 AWARDS  
 The strongest papers from the four conferences will be marked as distinguished papers and highlighted in the conference program. From these distinguished papers, the EAPLS, EASST, and EATCS, and the Best Tool Paper Award committees will select the best ETAPS papers.  
 The ETAPS Test-of-Time Award will be granted, recognizing outstanding papers published at ETAPS more than ten years in the past.  
 The ETAPS Rance Cleaveland Test-of-Time Tool Award acknowledges the importance of reliable and well-maintained research tools and the significant effort that their creation and maintenance entails.  
 The Doctoral Dissertation Award will be granted to promote and recognize an outstanding dissertation in the research areas covered by the four main ETAPS conferences.  
 All distinguished papers will be highlighted in the program.  
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
 The four main conferences of ETAPS 2025 solicit contributions of the following types. All page limits are given excluding the bibliography  .  
 ESOP: regular research papers of max 25 pp, experience reports of max 15 pp, and fresh perspectives providing new insights on programming languages and systems of max 15 pp. For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in other formats. There is no page limit at the submission time. Please refer to | ESOP page | for more details. 
  FASE: regular research papers and empirical evaluation papers of max 18 pp; new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers of max 8 pp; tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers of max 8 pp (+ optional appendix of max 6 pp), 
  FoSSaCS: regular research papers of max 18 pp; no submissions of PC members are allowed 
  TACAS: regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers of max 16 pp tool demonstration papers of max 6 pp 
  For definitions of the different paper types and specific instructions where they are present, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 All accepted papers will appear in Springer proceedings and have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation. We plan ETAPS 2025 as an on-site conference.  
 Submitted papers must be in English, presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden.  
 Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through the Easychair author interface of the respective conference. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately.  
 ESOP, FASE, and TACAS will use double-blind reviewing (in the case of TACAS only for regular research papers). Authors are asked to omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them.  
 ESOP and FoSSaCS will use an author rebuttal phase  . TACAS will use rebuttal for selected submissions (those in the gray zone).  
 Artifact submission and evaluation  
 Regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions to TACAS must be accompanied by an artifact submitted shortly after the paper. The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision.  
 For research paper and case study paper submissions, pre-paper-acceptance submission of an artifact is optional; if an artifact is submitted at this point, it will be handled as described above.  
 Alternatively, authors of papers of these categories may submit an artifact for evaluation after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the artifact evaluation will then not change the paper acceptance decision.  
 ESOP, FASE, and FoSSaCS will accept artifact submissions; however participation in it is voluntary; the artifact submission deadline is after the paper notification deadline. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.  
 For ESOP, artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including a 1-page bibliography) that will appear in the conference proceedings.  
 For specific instructions regarding artifacts, see the web pages of the individual conferences.  
 SATELLITE EVENTS (May 3–4, 2025)  
 Several satellite workshops and other events will take place during the weekend before the main conferences.  
 CITY AND HOST INSTITUTION  
 ETAPS 2025 will take place in Hamilton, Canada and is organized by McMaster University. The Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University has a reputation for innovative programs, cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a strong reputation as a center for academic excellence and innovation. The Faculty has approximately 180 faculty members, along with close to 4,500 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students. The Faculty of Engineering promotes a nurturing and inclusive environment where opportunities are made available for personal growth and professional development. McMaster University beautiful campus is at the north-west end of Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario, between the Niagara Escarpment, conservation lands, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Hamilton, with a population of over 500,000, is a vibrant community with easy access to Toronto and the Niagara region. It is located at the northern tip of an ecological zone commonly called the Carolinian Forest that encompasses the southernmost portion of Ontario but occurs nowhere else in Canada. As a result, Hamilton is home to many unique species of plants and animals that only occur here because the summer climate approaches that of North and South Carolina in the United States.

  Artifacts and Evaluation Criteria  
 An artifact is any additional material (software, data sets, machine-checkable proofs, etc.  ) that substantiates claims made in the paper and ideally renders them fully replicable. For example, an artifact might consist of a tool and its documentation, input files used for tool evaluation in the paper, and configuration files or documents describing parameters used in the experiments. The Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) will read the corresponding paper and evaluate the artifact according to the following criteria:  
 consistency with and replicability of results presented in the paper 
  completeness 
  documentation and ease of use 
  availability in a permanent online repository 
  The evaluation will be based on the EAPLS guidelines  , and the AEC will decide which of the badges — among Functional, Reusable, and Available — will be assigned to a given artifact and added to the title page of the paper in case of acceptance.  
 Compulsory AE for Tool and Tool Demonstration Papers  
 Regular tool papers and tool demonstration papers are required to submit an artifact for evaluation by October 24 th  , 2024  . These artifacts will be expected to satisfy the requirements for the "Functional" and "Available" badges. Results of AE will be taken into consideration in the paper reviewing and rebuttal phase of TACAS 2025. Exemption from some aspects of AE is possible in exceptional circumstances, see Exemption  .  
 Optional AE for Research and Case Study Papers  
 Authors of research and case study papers are invited to submit an artifact no later than January 9 th  2025  , anywhere on Earth. Artifact submission is optional, and the artifact will be reviewed only after paper acceptance.  
 Artifact Submission  
 Artifact submission is handled via EasyChair  . After the paper submission deadline, the paper submission will be copied by us from the main track to the artifact evaluation track. In this track, you should supply your submission's artifact abstract and upload a ZIP archive as supplementary material. Do not  attempt to create a new submission, nor change your submission's other details such as authors or title. Because of this copying process, you can upload or update your artifact either in the main track before the paper submission deadline, or in the AE track during a window before the deadline. The TACAS PC or AEC chairs will inform authors when the AE track is open for different paper categories.  
 An artifact submission must contain:  
 an abstract summarizing the artifact and its relation to the paper (entered in EasyChair) 
  a copy of the paper (already copied from the main track) 
  a ZIP archive (uploaded to EasyChair) containing: | a license document (LICENSE) for the artifact — it is required that the license at least allows the AEC to evaluate the artifact 
  instructions (README) including: | a hyperlink to the artifact 
  additional requirements for the artifact, such as installation of proprietary software or particular hardware resources 
  detailed instruction for an | early light review | that allows reviewers to: (1) verify that the artifact can properly run; and (2) perform a | short | evaluation of the artifact before the full evaluation and detect any difficulties (see | Rebuttal | ) 
  detailed instructions for use of the artifact and replication of results in the paper, including estimated resource use if non-trivial 
  The artifact hyperlink should point to a self-contained archive that allows the AEC to evaluate the artifact on the TACAS virtual machine OR docker image (see below for more information). Authors should test their artifact prior to the submission and include all relevant instructions. Instructions should be clear and specify every step required to build and run the artifact, assuming no specific knowledge and including steps that the authors might consider trivial. Ideally, there will be a single command to build the tool and a single command to run the experiments.  
 Guidelines for Artifacts  
 We expect artifact authors to package their artifact and write instructions such that AEC members can evaluate the artifact using the TACAS 2023 Artifact Evaluation Virtual Machine  (hereafter VM) for VirtualBox  . Note that this is not a misprint: we use the TACAS 2023 VM  as the AEC chairs consider it serviceable for TACAS 2025. The virtual machine is based on an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  image with the following additional packages: build-essential, cmake, clang, mono-complete, openjdk-8-jdk, python3.10, pip3 ruby, and a 32-bit libc. VirtualBox guest additions are installed on the VM; it is therefore possible to connect a shared folder from the host computer.  
 NEW:  Instead of the VM, authors may also provide a Docker  image that can be run on the AEC's machine. Do not assume that all reviewers are familiar with Docker. Please provide explicit instructions on how to run the Docker image, including every complete command line arguments.  
 Your artifact is allowed reasonable network access, following a wider trend for software builds requiring network access. Authors can therefore decide whether to supply a completely self-contained artifact, rely on network access for external resources, or combine both. However, the main artifact described in the paper must be included in the archive, and use of external resources is at the author's own risk. If you are using external resources, please ensure that they are version pinned to ensure long-term replicability. We anticipate typical usage of this relaxation to be for the installation of third-party dependencies. The AEC chairs welcome feedback on this aspect, in particular questions about atypical artifacts. All the same, if the artifact requires additional software or libraries that are not part of the virtual machine the instructions must include all necessary steps for their installation and setup on a "clean" VM. In particular, authors should not rely on instructions provided by external tools. Again, the ideal setup is a single command to install the tool and all dependencies and a single command to run the experiments.  
 It is to the advantage of authors to prepare an artifact that is easy to evaluate by the AEC. Some guidelines:  
 Your artifact | need not be anonymized | , in contrast to your paper which must be anonymized. In particular, you | need not rename | your tool in both paper and artifact, even if it yields a potential loss of anonymity. For instance, if you submit a paper/artifact on a new tool called XYZ5 which has a clear connection to a tool called XYZ4 (and the authors of XYZ4 are publicly known) then you should keep calling your tool XYZ5 and do not hide a relationship with XYZ4. Your paper/artifact will not be rejected because of this. 
  Keep the evaluation process simple (e.g. through the use of scripts), and provide detailed documentation assuming minimum user expertise. 
  Document in detail how to replicate most, or ideally all, of the experimental results of the paper using the artifact. 
  State resource requirements and/or the environment in which you successfully tested the artifact. 
  For experiments requiring a large amount of resources, we strongly recommend providing a way to replicate a representative subset of results such that results can be reproduced on various hardware platforms in reasonable time. Do include the full set of experiments for those reviewers with sufficient hardware or time. 
  Do not submit a virtual machine | ; only submit your files, which AEC members will copy into the provided virtual machine. 
  For the "Available" badge, you must upload your artifact to a permanent repository (e.g. Zenodo, figshare, or Dryad) that provides a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), and use that link in your submission. This excludes other repositories such as an institutional or personal website, source code hosting services, or cloud storage. 
  Please indicate which badges you are applying for in your submission. In particular, if you are not applying for the "Reusable" badge, please include a note to this end in your README file. 
  Members of the AEC will use the submitted artifact for the sole purpose of AE. We do, however, encourage authors to make their artifacts publicly and permanently available.  
 Please note that the reviewers will only have limited time to reproduce the experiments and they will likely use a machine that is different to yours. Again, if your experiments need a significant amount of time (more than a few hours), please prepare a representative subset of experiments that could be run in a shorter amount of time. It may be wise to test your artifact in the virtual machine running on other platforms available to you.  
 Exemption  
 Under particular conditions tool papers and tool demonstration papers may be exempted from submitting the artifact using the provided VM, or acquiring both the "Functional" and "Available" badges. Possible reasons for such exemptions include the need for special hardware (GPUs, compute clusters, robots, etc.  ), extreme resource requirements, or licensing issues. Artifacts should nonetheless be as complete as possible. Contact the AEC chairs as soon as possible if you anticipate the need for exemption.  
 Rebuttal  
 There will be no formal rebuttal procedure for AE. However, there will be an early light review of artifacts to ensure basic functionality: in case of technical issues at this stage and at the discretion of the AEC chairs, a single round  of rebuttal may be applied to some artifacts shortly after submission. A single set of questions from reviewers will be put to artifact authors, who may reply with a single set of answers to address issues and facilitate further evaluation. Update of the submitted files or further communication will not be allowed.

 Efficient Temporal Logic Runtime Monitoring for Tiny Systems  
  Abstract   
 While the theory and practice of runtime monitoring are overall well developed, in embedded systems, runtime monitoring is not as common as one would expect. Especially small-scale embedded systems, which are found in many household devices, are often somewhat safety-critical and could benefit from the possibility to detect software or hardware defects that cannot be uncovered with verification alone. While monitoring frameworks such as RTLola and Copilot are available to address this problem, employing them leads to a gap between verification and runtime monitoring by these frameworks having specialized specification languages for monitoring, and what can be expressed in them is incomparable to the capabilities of the temporal logics traditionally employed in formal verification.   
 This paper discusses how (linear) temporal logic runtime monitoring for small-scale embedded systems can be made more efficient and attractive to the embedded systems practitioner. This includes identifying why monitoring for traditional temporal logics is somewhat inefficient in software, how this problem can be addressed in a low-cost way, and how runtime monitors can become a more useful component of an embedded system. By providing a way to translate a specification to monitor code that also tracks the reason for a specification violation, the overall approach discussed in the paper makes spending developer time on writing a relatively precise specification of a system to build attractive, which also helps paving the way to make formal verification for small-scale embedded systems more common.

 Is MCDC Really Better? Lessons from Combining Tests and Proofs  
  Abstract   
 MCDC, for “Modified Condition/Decision Coverage”, is a test coverage criterion recommended in several important industrial software safety standards. The intuition behind MCDC is that it should be more effective than industry’s default coverage criterion, branch coverage, since it uses a finer-grain decomposition of program conditions.   
 Manually generating MCDC-compliant test suites is, however, tedious and error-prone; there is, as a result, little empirical evidence of whether that intuition holds up in practice. Does MCDC really provide enough of an advantage over branch coverage to justify the extra work and longer test runs?   
 To help answer this question, the present work takes advantage of verification technology that combines tests and proofs, based on the AutoProof program verifier.   
 For each decision point in the program, the approach proceeds in four steps. First, compute a set of conditions that satisfy MCDC. Then, inject into the program, for each combination, an incorrect instruction (a “seeded contradiction” in the terminology of previous work). Next, apply the prover to verify the instrumented program; the prover naturally fails, but in the process it produces a set of counterexamples  covering all the combinations. Finally, turn this result into a directly usable test suite—guaranteed by construction to satisfy the MCDC criterion.   
 The results, on a significant set of example programs, yield insights on how MCDC coverage compares to branch coverage and adaptive random testing when trying to detect faults.

 Refining CEGAR-Based Test-Case Generation with Feasibility Annotations  
  Abstract   
 Often, testing is part of software quality assurance, in which testers may use automatic tools to generate test cases. To avoid redundant work, the tools may consider collateral coverage, i.e., use that a test case generated for a particular test goal, e.g., a branch, may cover further goals. We present a novel approach to use collateral coverage during test-case generation with software model checkers that apply counterexample-guided abstraction refinement. For every test goal, those model checkers perform a reachability analysis, which we plan to support with previous test inputs. More concretely, we use a feasibility annotation to map already covered goals to their test inputs. Whenever the reachability analysis detects a syntactical path to an uncovered test goal, we select a test input from the feasibility annotation that is likely a (partial) input for the path and use this input as a potential guide to check whether the path is semantically feasible. So far, we have integrated our approach into  and evaluated it on the Test-Comp tasks. Compared to the original  approach, our approach performs similar or better. In total, we increase the achieved branch coverage by 2%, but may achieve a significantly larger increase for some tasks.

 No Smoke Without Fire: Detecting Specification Inconsistencies with Frama-C/WP  
  Abstract   
 Deductive verification provides a proof that, under the provided pre-conditions, each terminating execution of a given function satisfies the stated post-conditions. In general, pre- and post-conditions are expressed in a logical specification language and typically rely on theories including abstract definitions, axioms and lemmas. As they are written by humans, errors may be introduced into specifications. Some errors can be detected when the proof fails, but sometimes, they remain unnoticed due to misleading proofs: most of the program may become dead code under the provided pre-conditions, or the proof may succeed because of inconsistencies in hypotheses and axioms. In this tool paper, we explore how to detect such unwanted situations by using deductive verification techniques and describe the smoke test mechanism in Frama-C  / WP  , a popular deductive verifier for C  code. We show that, while the intuitive idea is simple, making it practical requires optimizations to scale up, and report on experiments with critical industrial code. Although our method is based on proof techniques, it is not complete and is similar to testing. In the end, can we ever be sure that our programs are proved well enough?

 Runtime Verification for High-Level Security Properties: Case Study on the TPM Software Stack  
  Abstract   
 The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a cryptoprocessor designed to provide hardware-based secure storage and protect integrity of modern computers. Communications with the TPM go through the TPM Software Stack (TSS), a popular implementation of which is the open-source library tpm2-tss  . It is thus crucial to ensure that no leak of sensitive data may occur in the TSS during communications between the host platform and the TPM. Recent work on deductive verification of functional and safety properties for this library faced several challenges. The purpose of this case study paper is to focus on high-level security properties, and to propose an alternative validation approach for such properties on the library by using runtime verification. We describe the proposed approach, apply it to specify and verify at runtime some key security properties using the Frama-C  verification platform and report on our first evaluation results.

 Cyclone: A New Tool for Verifying/Testing Graph-Based Structures  
  Tool Paper   
 Abstract   
 We present a new tool called Cyclone that can be used for verifying and testing graph-based models. Different from other verification tools, Cyclone provides users with a unique way of building models and specifying their properties, by explicitly constructing and reasoning about graphs. As graphs can naturally capture both static and dynamic behaviours of a system, this allows users to represent many challenging problems. In this tool paper, we describe Cyclone’s basic features through different examples. Our preliminary evaluation results show that Cyclone has a promising potential in handling verification tasks from various domains and good usability for those who are not familiar with using verification tools.

 Model-Based Testing of Quantum Computations  
  Abstract   
 Quantum computers are able to effectively solve certain types of problems being intractable by classical computers, including tasks from linear optimization, machine learning and simulation of natural phenomena. The counter-intuitive behavior of quantum algorithms makes it particularly important to develop practical techniques and tools to support the analysis and quality assurance of quantum programs. For classical programs, software testing is today one of the most effective and easy-to-use quality-assurance techniques. However, many postulates of quantum physics like superposition, entanglement and non-cloneability of qubit states as well as the probabilistic outcome and destructive effects of qubit measurements obstruct any straight-forward adaptation of classical testing techniques to quantum programs. Recent works either treat quantum programs as black-box components with classical interfaces to apply end-to-end testing or shift the focus of quality assurance to formal verification of quantum programs. In this paper, we instead propose a model-based framework for testing quantum computations at the level of execution traces. Our approach is independent of the quantum programming language and hardware used and utilizes probabilistic transition systems as abstract test model for both the specification and implementation to be tested. In our model, we carefully distinguish between controllable and observable as well as between nondeterministic and probabilistic test steps. Our framework makes quantum program testing a partly reactive process that can be complemented by statistical approaches for identifying erroneous qubit states by repeated measurements.

 Affinitree: A Compositional Framework for Formal Analysis and Explanation of Deep Neural Networks  
  Abstract   
 We present Affinitree  , a compositional framework for analyzing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based on three elementary principles: (1) symbolic execution, (2) infeasible path elimination, and (3) abstraction. The combination of these principles allows one to elegantly solve a number of interesting analysis and verification tasks, like traditional verification problems with pre- and post-conditions, model explanations in terms of semantically equivalent decision trees, concolic execution for slice-oriented testing, and visual verification of two-dimensional slices. The paper illustrates the flexibility of Affinitree  over three different use cases covering fairness evaluation, adversarial examples, and counterfactuals. Affinitree  is available as a modular open source library for replication, experimentation, and extension.

 Exploring Loose Coupling of Slicing with Dynamic Symbolic Execution on the JVM  
  Abstract   
 Dynamic symbolic execution is an effective technique for fuzzing programs with application to software verification as well if the search terminates during symbolic execution. However, the state space explosion problem often prevents the symbolic search from exploring the entire state space. As static analysis operates on the whole program rather than single execution paths, it can cut out parts of the program that are irrelevant for verifying a property. In this paper, we explore how slicing can be used before dynamic symbolic execution for analyzing assertion reachability in Java  programs. We report on our first experience using state-of-the-art open-source Java  slicers on the SV-COMP Java  benchmark before applying GDart  , a dynamic symbolic execution engine for Java  . Currently, this experiment has not been successful, as the slicers are not mature enough to reliably produce correct slices of a task in the SV-COMP benchmark. However, in a few examples, the approach delivered promising results that motivate the future development of slicers for Java  .

 // Research Track  

 SYSTOR accepts both full-length and short papers. A short paper is intended for an idea that can be described and evaluated in fewer pages; the goal of the short paper is not for preliminary work or workshop-style position papers.   
 A good SYSTOR paper should present a novel, compelling solution to a well-motivated problem. The evaluation should demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the solution in settings that are as realistic as possible, including test applications workloads, system parameters, and assumed constraints. Authors should clearly describe their contribution in the context of prior work, and draw meaningful conclusions from their work.   
 The program committee also encourages submissions that describe lessons learned from operational (especially large-scale) system deployments. Such submissions are expected to include sufficient details of the system, its design goals, and the methods used for evaluating whether these goals were met.   
 The program committee will value submissions accompanied by supplemental material such as traces and open-source code that can help reproduce the reported results, and advance additional research in the field.   
 A small set of outstanding papers will be forwarded to a suitable journal, such as ACM journal Transactions on Storage (TOS) or Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), for a fast-tracked review process for an expanded version of the paper.   
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all  ACM Publications Policies   , including ACM’s new  Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   .   
 Accepted papers may be invited to participate also in the Israeli Systems Workshop.  

 // Posters Track  

 SYSTOR also welcomes academic and industrial posters. See “Call for Papers” above for foci and relevant areas.   
 A good poster submission will articulate and motivate an interesting problem, and describe a new insight or approach to addressing this problem. It will clearly present the work in progress (or attained results), and the expected outcomes from future work. The poster should present these details in a manner that is clear and captivating.   
 Poster submissions should include a one-page extended abstract, and a draft of the poster. The extended abstracts of accepted posters will be included in the online conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will review poster submissions in a single-blind manner.   
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all  ACM Publications Policies   , including ACM’s new  Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   .   
 Accepted posters can opt-in for physical presentation at the Israeli Systems Workshop in person.  
 Additional posters to be presented (physically) in ISW – the Israeli Systems Workshop  only, can be submitted by September 5.  
   Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to sarelco@mta.ac.il  and moshesu@mta.ac.il   

 // HIGHLIGHTS TRACK - ISRAELI SYSTEMS WORKSHOP  

 The highlights track gives an opportunity for research, published over the last year in a systems conference (e.g., SOSP, OSDI, FAST, ASPLOS, EuroSys, ATC, NSDI), to reach a broader audience with a second presentation (similar to ATC’s “Best of the Rest” track). Highlight papers will be presented in-person  at the Israeli Systems Workshop on September 25, so at least one author must physically attend the workshop.  
 Submission should include the paper abstract and details (where / when) of the previous publication. The paper will not be republished in the SYSTOR conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  

 // Submission Instructions  

 Research papers (full and short) should be submitted through: https://systor24.hotcrp.com   
 Posters should be submitted through: https://systor24posters.hotcrp.com   
 Highlight papers for the Israeli Systems Workshop should be submitted through: https://systor24highlights.hotcrp.com   
 Additional posters to be presented (physically) in ISW – the Israeli Systems Workshop  only, can be submitted by September 5.  
   Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to sarelco@mta.ac.il  and moshesu@mta.ac.il   
  
 Review Process  
 The program committee will review submissions  to the Research Track in a double-blind manner. All submissions should be properly anonymized, removing all identifiable information whenever possible including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.   
 Any submissions accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement will be returned without review  .   
 Copyright and originality of the work  
 SYSTOR will enforce  ACM’s Plagiarism policy   regarding copying and resubmission of prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to SYSTOR must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal.   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the earlier of either the first day of the conference or the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to  two weeks prior   to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   
 Formatting instructions  
 Papers should be submitted electronically as a PDF. All text and figures must fit within a 7”x9” text block, centered on the page, using two columns with .33 inches of separation. The paper should be typeset using a 10-point font (Times New Roman or similar) with a 12-point (single-spaced) leading.   
 For the Full and Short Paper Tracks, please follow  paper formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template,  is available here   .   
 For the Posters Track, please follow  poster formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template, is available here   .   
 Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please email the program chairs: Sam H. Noh and Aviad Zuck  .    
 Additional instructions regarding camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be sent directly to the corresponding authors and will appear  he  re  after the notification to authors.   
 Virtual presentation instructions  
 Please follow the video preparation and presentation instructions provided here  .  
 Arxiv  
 A paper submitted to SYSTOR can be submitted simultaneously to Arxiv, with some changes. We would like the authors to make an honest effort to preserve anonymity. Please ensure the SYSTOR submission is using a different title and a different system name from the Arxiv version. It would be useful to let the chairs know if there is an Arxiv paper so that we can intervene if PC members find it accidentally and think the submission is plagiarizing the Arxiv paper.   
 Open Source  
 The authors of a SYSTOR submission are encouraged to associate a source code repo with their submission, but this repo must be completely anonymized. It is alright if a named (= not anonymized) source code repo exists, so long as it isn’t associated/linked with the submission in any way. An anonymized repo can be a clone of the named repo which is modified to be anonymous. Another way to do this is  https://anonymous.4open.science/   .

 ACM Case Studies   
 Written by leading domain experts for software engineers, ACM Case Studies provide an in-depth look at how software teams overcome specific challenges by implementing new technologies, adopting new practices, or a combination of both. Often through first-hand accounts, these pieces explore what the challenges were, the tools and techniques that were used to combat them, and the solution that was achieved.

  Scope  
 TAP 2024 is the 18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs. TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.  
 Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing.  
 TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.  
 Please check the | call for papers | for a list of topics of interest. 
  Submission and Proceedings  
 Accepted submissions will be published in Springer’s LNCS series.  
   
 Please check the | submission | page for detailed instructions for preparing your submission.

 The Twentieth Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK 2025)——————————————————————————————————————————————  
 Submissions are invited to TARK 2025. The conference will be held from July 14 until July 16, 2025, at the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf in Germany.  
 Conference website: https://ccc.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/tark-2025/  .  
 Extended abstracts can be submitted at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tark2025  .  
 Deadline for abstract registrations: March 14, 2025, anywhere on earth.  
 Deadline for submissions: March 21, 2025, anywhere on earth.  
 Scope and Mission: The mission of the TARK conferences is to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, including Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Game Theory, Decision Theory, Philosophy, Logic, Linguistics, and Cognitive Science, in order to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge. Previous conferences have been held bi-annually around the world. The information of all previous TARK conferences can be accessed at http://www.tark.org  .  
 Topics of interest: These include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, awareness and uncertainty, bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, epistemic game theory, knowledge and action, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and foundations of multi-agent systems.  
 Content: Strong preference will be given to papers whose topic is of interest to an interdisciplinary audience, and papers should be accessible to such an audience. Papers will be held to the usual high standards of research publications. In particular, they should:  
 1) contain enough information to enable the program committee to identify the main contribution of the work;  
 2) explain the significance of the work—its novelty and its practical or theoretical implications; and  
 3) include comparisons with and references to relevant literature.  
 Style: Extended abstracts should be no longer than 10 pages. Optional technical details such as proofs may be included in an appendix. One author of each accepted paper will be expected to present the paper at the conference. Note that the 10 page limit is to ensure that the reviewers can read and express an opinion on the submission within a short time. Please ensure that the main text for the reviewers stays within this limit.  
 Format: To format your paper, please use the EPTCS LaTeX style from: http://style.eptcs.org/  .  
 TARK reviewing is not double-anonymised, so author names can be included in the submission.

 Founded in 1986, the mission of the bi-annual TARK conferences is to bring together researchers interested in issues surrounding knowledge and rationality. TARK draws contributions from a wide variety of fields - including Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography, Distributed Computing, Economics and Game Theory, Linguistics, Logic, Philosophy, and Psychology, in order to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, for belief, and for uncertainty bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, logics of knowledge and action, formal analysis of games, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, and the role of knowledge in general information flow. TARK has been influential in building bridges between the above disciplines, and in accelerating new research trends both through the actual event and the circulation of its proceedings.

  How are ratings calculated?   To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.

 Call for Papers  

 Call for Papers  
  
 The ACM International Systems and Storage Conference (SYSTOR) is an international forum for interaction across the systems research community. The program includes innovative, peer-reviewed research papers in the broad area of systems, as well as distinguished keynote lecturers, a poster session, and social events. ACM SYSTOR is designed to engage academic and industrial researchers and practitioners, welcoming both students and seasoned professionals.   

 Call for Papers  
 SYSTOR has traditionally welcomed academic and industrial papers in systems including storage, cloud and distributed systems, networking, and systems security, broadly construed. While continuing on this tradition, this year, we are broadening the scope to also include research on systems issues in AI and/or sustainability, including those that involve workload optimization, data processing, lifecycle of systems, carbon footprint transparency, and system re-designs. SYSTOR encourages submissions that describe results from experimental system prototypes, as well as experience papers describing practical deployments, and valuable lessons learned from them.   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:   
 Systems and workload optimization for AI/ML systems 
  Sustainability/carbon footprint of computer and network systems 
  System security and trust 
  Big Data infrastructure 
  Cloud, edge, data center, and distributed systems 
  Embedded and real-time systems 
  Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability 
  File and storage systems 
  Networked, mobile, wireless, peer-to-peer, and sensor systems 
  Operating systems, computer architecture, and their interactions 
  Performance evaluation and workload characterization 
  Runtime systems and compiler/programming-language support 
  System deployment, usage, and experience 
  System design or adaptation for emerging storage technologies 
  Virtualization and containers 
  Storage 3.0 
  SYSTOR 2024 solicits submissions in four separate categories:   
 Full Papers Track | – original research, at most 12 pages, excluding references 
  Short Papers Track | – original research, at most 5 pages, excluding references 
  Posters with Extended Abstract Track | – original work presented as a poster, accompanied by an extended abstract in the conference proceedings 
  Highlights Track for the Israeli Systems Workshop | – papers previously published in a systems conference 
  Attendance  
 Systor 2024 is postponed to September 23-24 and will be virtual.  
    
 Due to concerns about the current situation in Israel, ACM Systor 2024 conference will be virtual, in collaboration with the Israeli Systems Workshop on September 25  in the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel.

 // Research Track  

 SYSTOR accepts both full-length and short papers. A short paper is intended for an idea that can be described and evaluated in fewer pages; the goal of the short paper is not for preliminary work or workshop-style position papers.   
 A good SYSTOR paper should present a novel, compelling solution to a well-motivated problem. The evaluation should demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the solution in settings that are as realistic as possible, including test applications workloads, system parameters, and assumed constraints. Authors should clearly describe their contribution in the context of prior work, and draw meaningful conclusions from their work.   
 The program committee also encourages submissions that describe lessons learned from operational (especially large-scale) system deployments. Such submissions are expected to include sufficient details of the system, its design goals, and the methods used for evaluating whether these goals were met.   
 The program committee will value submissions accompanied by supplemental material such as traces and open-source code that can help reproduce the reported results, and advance additional research in the field.   
 A small set of outstanding papers will be forwarded to a suitable journal, such as ACM journal Transactions on Storage (TOS) or Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), for a fast-tracked review process for an expanded version of the paper.   
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all  ACM Publications Policies   , including ACM’s new  Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   .   
 Accepted papers may be invited to participate also in the Israeli Systems Workshop.  

 // Posters Track  

 SYSTOR also welcomes academic and industrial posters. See “Call for Papers” above for foci and relevant areas.   
 A good poster submission will articulate and motivate an interesting problem, and describe a new insight or approach to addressing this problem. It will clearly present the work in progress (or attained results), and the expected outcomes from future work. The poster should present these details in a manner that is clear and captivating.   
 Poster submissions should include a one-page extended abstract, and a draft of the poster. The extended abstracts of accepted posters will be included in the online conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will review poster submissions in a single-blind manner.   
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all  ACM Publications Policies   , including ACM’s new  Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   .   
 Accepted posters can opt-in for physical presentation at the Israeli Systems Workshop in person.  
 Additional posters to be presented (physically) in ISW – the Israeli Systems Workshop  only, can be submitted by September 5.  
   Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to sarelco@mta.ac.il  and moshesu@mta.ac.il   

 // HIGHLIGHTS TRACK - ISRAELI SYSTEMS WORKSHOP  

 The highlights track gives an opportunity for research, published over the last year in a systems conference (e.g., SOSP, OSDI, FAST, ASPLOS, EuroSys, ATC, NSDI), to reach a broader audience with a second presentation (similar to ATC’s “Best of the Rest” track). Highlight papers will be presented in-person  at the Israeli Systems Workshop on September 25, so at least one author must physically attend the workshop.  
 Submission should include the paper abstract and details (where / when) of the previous publication. The paper will not be republished in the SYSTOR conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

 Review Process  
 The program committee will review submissions  to the Research Track in a double-blind manner. All submissions should be properly anonymized, removing all identifiable information whenever possible including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.   
 Any submissions accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement will be returned without review  .   
 Copyright and originality of the work  
 SYSTOR will enforce  ACM’s Plagiarism policy   regarding copying and resubmission of prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to SYSTOR must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal.   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the earlier of either the first day of the conference or the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to  two weeks prior   to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   
 Formatting instructions  
 Papers should be submitted electronically as a PDF. All text and figures must fit within a 7”x9” text block, centered on the page, using two columns with .33 inches of separation. The paper should be typeset using a 10-point font (Times New Roman or similar) with a 12-point (single-spaced) leading.   
 For the Full and Short Paper Tracks, please follow  paper formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template,  is available here   .   
 For the Posters Track, please follow  poster formatting instructions   . The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template, is available here   .   
 Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please email the program chairs: Sam H. Noh and Aviad Zuck  .    
 Additional instructions regarding camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be sent directly to the corresponding authors and will appear  he  re  after the notification to authors.   
 Virtual presentation instructions  
 Please follow the video preparation and presentation instructions provided here  .  
 Arxiv  
 A paper submitted to SYSTOR can be submitted simultaneously to Arxiv, with some changes. We would like the authors to make an honest effort to preserve anonymity. Please ensure the SYSTOR submission is using a different title and a different system name from the Arxiv version. It would be useful to let the chairs know if there is an Arxiv paper so that we can intervene if PC members find it accidentally and think the submission is plagiarizing the Arxiv paper.   
 Open Source  
 The authors of a SYSTOR submission are encouraged to associate a source code repo with their submission, but this repo must be completely anonymized. It is alright if a named (= not anonymized) source code repo exists, so long as it isn’t associated/linked with the submission in any way. An anonymized repo can be a clone of the named repo which is modified to be anonymous. Another way to do this is  https://anonymous.4open.science/   .

 No PDF available, click to view other formats  Abstract:  The TARK conference (Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge) is a conference that aims to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, including computer science, artificial intelligence, game theory, decision theory, philosophy, logic, linguistics, and cognitive science. Its goal is to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge.  
  Previous conferences have been held biennially around the world since 1986, on the initiative of Joe Halpern (Cornell University). Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, awareness and uncertainty, bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, epistemic game theory, knowledge and action, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and foundations of multi-agent systems. Information about TARK, including conference proceedings, is available at this http URL   
  These proceedings contain the papers that have been accepted for presentation at the Nineteenth Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK 2023), held between June 28 and June 30, 2023, at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. The conference website can be found at this https URL

 ACM SenSys 2025  
  6 - 9 May  Irvine, USA   
 The 23rd ACM Conference on  
  Embedded Networked Sensor Systems   
 In transition to Conference on  
  Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems    

 Announcement from the Joint  
  SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI Steering Committee  
 We are excited to announce the merger of three leading conferences — ACM SenSys, ACM/IEEE IPSN, and ACM/IEEE IoTDI — into a single premier event under the new name SenSys: Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems  . This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The new SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field.   
 ACM SenSys 2025  will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, but retaining the current SenSys name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) due to the time required for institutional approvals. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. We are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.

Similar to full papers, accepted short papers will be presented orally at the conference.   
   
 Submission Guidelines:  
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be at most 12 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages  with 10-pt font size (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables.  As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here  . LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font (override default font of 9-pt). Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system.  
   
  Papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library and presented in person at the conference.

 Call for Proposals for holding future TCCs  
 We are seeking organizers for future TCCs. Would you like to be one? If so, please let the steering committee know of your interest ASAP by notifying shaih AT alum DOT mit DOT edu  . It will be useful if you provide as much as possible of the following information (but this can wait for a later stage): Proposed general chair: The person organizing the conference gets this job. 
  Proposed location: city, country 
  Propose venue (university, hotel, other) 
  Proposed dates (try to avoid | Friday and Saturday | ) 
  Facilities: Is there auditorium style seating? How many persons does the room accommodate? 
  Cost: Could you roughly estimate the cost for hotel and facilities? 
  Years: Let us know whether your proposal can be carried over into future years if not selected for the next year. 
  Indeed, we will need the aforementioned information at a later stage (i.e., at the time we choose the location), but Shai will let you know of our needs for these details in due time. We typically want to make a decision for TCC N  a few months ahead of TCC N-1  . Current status  : The location of TCC'14 has been determined. Currently, the next proposal we seek is for TCC'15. If you'd like to make a proposition for TCC'15 or a later year please send Shai an initial email. Detailed proposals would be sought at a later stage.  
 Preferred dates  : Our default is to hold TCC between mid February and early March with preference to mid February. However, deviation (as per local constraints) have occurred (see history table below).
