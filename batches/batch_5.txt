 20TH MACHINE TRANSLATION SUMMIT (GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, 23-24 JUNE 2025)  
 FIRST CALL FOR WORKSHOPS & TUTORIALS  
 *** Important dates ***  
 - Submission deadline: 25 November 2024  
  - Notification of acceptance: 13 December 2024  
  - Workshop date: 23 or 24 June 2025  
 *** Submission information ***  
 The European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT) invites proposals for tutorials & workshops to be held in conjunction with the MT Summit 2025 conference, taking place in Geneva, Switzerland. Workshops and tutorials will take place before the main conference, on 23 and 24 June 2025.  
 We seek proposals in all areas of machine translation, LLMs applied to translation, computer-assisted translation technologies, spoken language translation and related topics.  
 Please visit our official website for more information: https://mtsummit2025.unige.ch/   
 ***Call for Workshop Proposals***  
  Workshops will be held on June 23-24, 2025. We invite proposals for half-day or full-day workshops (up to 8 hours, including breaks). Workshops should provide an opportunity for MT-related communities to advance the state of thinking or practice in their area of interest.  
 MT Summit workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT­related communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state of thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or endeavour.  
 Workshops may be scheduled as half-day or full-day events (up to 8 hours, including coffee and lunch breaks). Proponents need to explicitly state the duration of the workshop.  
 ***Call for Tutorial Proposals***  
 The aim of a tutorial is primarily to help the audience to develop understanding of specific technical, applied, and business matters related to research, development, and use of MT and translation technology.  
 Presentations of specific technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations.  
 We recommend that the tutorial covers work by the presenters as well as by other researchers. The submission should explain that this breadth is ensured. Tutorials should not be “self-invited talks”.  
 Tutorials are generally scheduled as half-day events (up to 3.5 hours, including coffee break).

 26th International Conference on Agile Software Development  
   
 XP 2025 • Brugg-Windisch, Switzerland • June 2-5, 2025   
  We welcome the XP community for the first time in Switzerland  !   
 XP is the premier agile software development conference, that combines, both, research and practice. It is a unique forum where agile researchers, practitioners, thought leaders, coaches, and trainers gather to present and discuss their most recent innovations and research results. At its inception, 26 years ago, the XP conference focused solely on eXtreme Programming. It quickly widened its scope to include all modern agile approaches and all the developing aspects of agility. XP draws people from around the globe, providing a diverse and inclusive environment for learning and inspiring conversations.  
 What matters to you?   
 In just a few years, AI tools have been widely adopted by industry and their capabilities have improved enormously. Together with other trends such as platform engineering, conversational applications, sustainable development, and many more, the way we develop, operate, and evolve software may change drastically. At the same time, with the digital revolution, software has become part of the critical infrastructure of the entire economy; software is a core asset of many companies and is responsible for their success.  
 How can these trends and new research support and enhance agile software development and its operation in the future? Are the agile values and principles described in the manifesto still valid and/or sufficient?  
 What other trends, innovations, and research do you see emerging in the development and operation of valuable software products? Do you want to help shape the future of software development? Do you have ideas, and solutions or have you done experiments and research to solve a specific problem?  
  Call for Submissions   
 For XP 2025, we are interested in talks and papers, especially those on this year’s theme:  
 Adapt - Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products     
 To find out more about a particular track and to enter a submission, please click on the relevant track in the tracks menu. Each track page includes a list of deadlines, guidelines, requirements, and other submission information.  
 Stay tuned and see you in Switzerland!

 MT Summit 2025: CALL FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST   
 June 30, 2023 (updated on June 30, 2023) 
    
 The European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT) invites expressions of interest to host the MT Summit 2025 conference, to be held in Europe, the Middle East or Africa (EMEA) between Summer and Autumn 2025. This will be the 20th Machine Translation Summit, which takes place bi-annually and its organisation and is overseen by the International Association for Machine Translation (IAMT), rotating between the sister organisations: EAMT, AMTA (Association for Machine Translation in the Americas) and AAMT (Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation).  
 At this stage, we seek draft proposals from prospective bidders. These will be evaluated and promising bidders will be asked to provide additional information for the final selection. The EAMT president will act as general chair and will work together with local organisers to design and shape the conference, including the appointment of chairs.  
 Draft proposals (due August 20, 2023) should include information on all of the following items:  
  1. Proposed dates: between Spring and Autumn 2025  
  2. Location: city and conference venue. Indicate whether the conference would be held at a university, hotel or convention centre. Bear in mind that EAMT is growing and we expect the same will happen with MT Summit. While Ghent (EAMT 2022) had around 120 registered participants, Tampere (EAMT 2023) had around 190 registered participants. The last in person MT Summit (Dublin, 2019) had around 300 participants. So please suggest a location that could host 400+ people for the main conference sessions, plus at least 4 conference rooms hosting parallel workshops and tutorials (100 people each), a large poster or exhibit room; and room for registration  
  3. Local arrangements team: local chair/co-chair, committee (identifying a coordinator to be co-opted as EAMT executive committee member), volunteer labour (e.g. students), registration handling. The local arrangements team will be responsible for activities such as arranging meeting rooms, equipment, refreshments, accommodation, on-site registration, participant internet access, the reception, the conference dinner, and working with the other chairs and the EAMT Board to develop the budget and registration materials. Indicate whether any national/regional Computational Linguistics association would be on board of the local organisation  
  4. Computing/wifi/audiovisual: whether there will be desktop/laptop in conference rooms and high-speed wireless Internet access, what the audiovisual facilities are  
  5. Food catering including breaks, reception, poster sessions and conference dinner  
  6. Social events including infrastructure for banquet/other social event and reception  
  7. Potential for local sponsorships  
  8. Opportunities for co-location with other meetings  
  9. The costs related to all of the above items, which should be indicated in the expenses spreadsheet (template provided below).  
 Proposals will be evaluated with respect to a number of criteria (unordered):  
  ● Adequacy of conference and exhibit facilities for the anticipated number of registrants  
  ● Adequacy of accommodations and food services (in a range of price categories) and proximity to the conference facilities  
  ● Adequacy of expenses projections and expected surplus  
  ● Appropriateness of proposed dates  
  ● Geographical and national balance with regard to previous EACL and ACL conferences, and other major Natural Language Processing conferences held in EMEA  
  ● Co-location with national/regional conferences  
  ● Experience of the local arrangements team  
  ● Local CL community support  
  ● Local government and industry support  
  ● Appropriateness of expected registration fees  
  ● Accessibility of proposed site  
 Please send your expressions of interest electronically to the EAMT president:  
 Helena Moniz: helena.moniz  campus.ul.pt  
 The EAMT board encourages groups who intend to submit a proposal to ask questions about how to prepare the proposal.  
 Important Dates:  
 August 11th, 2023: Deadline for bids 
  August 18th, 2023: Feedback to bidders and announcement of shortlist of bidders 
  August 25th, 2023: Final bids with implemented feedback

 About  

 11th Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science  
 CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. It is a high-level bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS  (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science), and WADT  (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Swansea  (Wales, 2005), Bergen  (Norway, 2007), Udine  (Italy, 2009), Winchester  (UK, 2011), Warsaw  (Poland, 2013), Nijmegen  (The Netherlands, 2015), Ljubljana  (Slovenia, 2017), London  (United Kingdom, 2019), Salzburg  (Austria, 2021), Bloomington  (USA, 2023).

 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March  
  IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions.  
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

 Fun with Algorithms  
 Algorithms and data structures are the base of all computing, from CRUD APIs to highly optimized data processing.  
 Software Design   
 Fun   
   
 Most of us probably have forgotten more than we remember about them though from college (or maybe never learned them in the first place) because we don't necessarily use them on a daily. But just like math, good knowledge about data structures and algorithms lay the foundation for how to think about difficult problems, and how to understand where and what to optimize.  
 This session is a programming language agnostic journey through problem solving - graph algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, representations and data structures. How to build solutions from first principles and combine algos to build up from easy to medium to hard leet code or advent of code style problems.  
 I'll also share how algorithm puzzles and competitive programming brought the fun back into programming for me, and how I use these skills in my day job.

 *** CoNLL 2025: 1st Call for Papers ***  
 Vienna, Austria, July 31 - August 1, 2025 (co-located with ACL)  
 SIGNLL invites submissions to the 29th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2025). The focus of CoNLL is on theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics, rather than on work driven by particular engineering applications. We welcome work targeting any aspect of language and its computational modeling, including:  
 * Computational Psycholinguistics, Cognition and Linguistics  
  * Computational Social Science and Sociolinguistics  
  * Interaction and Dialogue  
  * Language Acquisition, Learning, Emergence, and Evolution  
  * Multimodality and Grounding  
  * Typology and Multilinguality  
  * Speech and Phonology  
  * Syntax and Morphology  
  * Lexical, Compositional and Discourse Semantics  
  * Theoretical Analysis and Interpretation of ML Models for NLP  
  * Resources and Tools for Scientifically Motivated Research  
 We do not restrict the topic of submissions to fall into this list. However, the submissions’ relevance to the conference’s focus on theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches will play an important role in the review process.  
 Submitted papers must be anonymous and use the same template as the ACL 2025. Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content plus unlimited space for references. Authors of accepted papers will have an additional page to address reviewers’ comments in the camera-ready version (9 pages of content in total, excluding references). Optional anonymized supplementary materials and a PDF appendix are allowed. The appendix should be submitted as a separate PDF file (reviewers are not required to consider the materials in the appendix so it should not include any essential content to the understanding of the paper). Please refer to the ACL 2025 Call for Papers for more details on the submission format. Note that, unlike ACL, we do not mandate that papers have a discussion section of the limitations of the work. However, we strongly encourage authors to have such a section in the appendix.  
 Submission will be via OpenReview. CoNLL 2025 will also accept ARR submission depending on the full review to be completed by May 19 2025. Please note that CoNLL 2025 is an in-person conference. We expect all accepted papers to be presented physically and presenting authors must register through ACL (workshop).  
 ** Timeline **  
 (All deadlines are 11:59pm UTC-12h, AoE)  
  * Direct submission deadline: Friday, March 14 2025  
  * ARR Commitment deadline: Monday, May 19 2025  
  * Notification of acceptance: Friday, May 23 2025  
  * Camera ready papers due: Wednesday, June 25 2025  
  * Conference: July 31 - August 1, 2025  
 ** Venue **  
 CoNLL 2025 will be held in-person, along with ACL in Vienna, Austria.  
 ** Multiple submission policy **  
 CoNLL 2025 will refuse papers that are currently under submission, or that will be submitted to other meetings or publications, including ACL. Papers submitted elsewhere and papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere will be rejected. Authors submitting more than one paper to CoNLL 2025 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.  
 ** Further information **  
 Further information (such as travel visas) will be announced in the 2nd Call for Papers.

 About FedCSIS  
 Conference webpage: Home | FedCSIS 2025   
 The mission   of the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area of computer science.  
 The FedCSIS conference consists of the  Main Track   and  Thematic Tracks  . Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned by their authors to  Topical Areas   which are managed by  Topical Area Curators  . Basing on a paper’s scope, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from the  Main Track  Program Committee   . Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Tracks which are announced in their own  Calls for Thematic Track Papers   and are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community.  
 FedCSIS Conference Series Timeline  
 2005: the story begins  
 The first event that the history of FedCSIS conference series can be traced to, took place in 2005. It was the Scientific Session organized within the scope of the 2005 Autumn Meeting of the Polish Information Processing Society (PIPS).  
 2006: first full-blown conference  
 In 2006, the first event under the name International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Systems (IMCSIT) took place. It was co-located with the 2006 Autumn Meeting of the Polish Information Processing Society. The IMCSIT multiconference was co-located with the Autumn Meetings of PIPS till 2010, when IMCSIT became an independent event under the new name (FedCSIS) and with a somewhat modified formula.  
 2007: data loss  
 In 2007 computers holding data related to the 2005 and 2006 events have been sabotaged by hackers and the web sites for the two events have been lost. What remained intact, were the 2005 and 2006 proceedings, which can be found in conference archive  .  
 2009: IFAC Workshop  
 In 2009, within the scope of the IMCSIT conference, the 30 th  IFAC Workshop on Real-Time Programming was organized. It resulted in an  independent proceedings volume  .  
 2011: FedCSIS is born  
 In 2011, the first edition of the Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS) took place. The change in name was related to the recognition that the term multiconference became questionable, due to a number of bad quality multiconferences organized around the world. It was also an initial attempt to bring more structure to the event.  
 2014 and 2015: special events  
 In 2014 and 2015 two special (dissemination) workshops have been organized within the scope of respective FedCSIS conferences. They were: “E2LP Workshop Application of Innovative Teaching Methods in Embedded Engineering” and “QMR Workshop on Logics for Qualitative Modelling and Reasoning”. Both those events resulted from funded projects and produced their own proceedings, which can be found in the conference archive  . We plan to host dissemination events in the future and welcome proposals to organize them.  
 2014: position papers introduced  
 In 2014, for the first time, a separate volume containing position papers was produced. Position papers relate to an ongoing research or experience. There are two types of position papers:  
 Challenge papers  propose and describe research challenges in theory or practice of computer science and information/intelligence systems. The papers in this category must be based on deep understanding of existing research or industrial problems. Based on such understanding and experience, they need to define new exciting research directions and show why these directions are crucial to the society at large.  
 Emerging research papers  present preliminary research results from work-in-progress based on sound scientific approach but presenting work not completely validated as yet. They must describe precisely the research problem and its rationale. They must also define precisely the intended future work including the expected benefits from solution to the tackled problem. Subsequently, they may be more conceptual than experimental.  
 2014: data minining competition  
 2014 was also the first time we organized a data mining competition associated with the FedCSIS conference. Since then, such FedCSIS data-science-style challenges have been organized almost every year, using the specialized online platform KnowledgePit  . Every year, one can find in the FedCSIS program – and in the FedCSIS proceedings – Technical Sessions focused on the discussion of competition results and descriptions of the winning solutions submitted by the data science teams from around the world.  
 2017: communication papers introduced  
 In 2017, communication papers were introduced as a separate category of contributions (in a separate volume). They report on research topics worthy of immediate communication. They may be used to mark a hot new research territory or to describe work in progress in order to quickly present it to scientific community. They may also contain additional information omitted from the earlier papers or may present software tools and products in a research state.  
 2019: numbering of conferences  
 In 2019, we realized that the number of conferences that had been organized in the series has reached the level where it may be valuable to indicate that this is the 14 th  edition of the event.  
 2020: adjusting conference structure  
 In 2020, conference structure was evaluated on the basis of 14 years of experiences. As a result, five tracks were introduced, while events that had been loosely grouped into areas, were aligned within tracks, becoming their Technical Sessions. This structural alignment resulted in dropping the term “federated” from the name, while keeping the acronym FedCSIS. The latter was a deliberate decision, aiming at showing historical continuity of the event.  
 2021: CORE B ranking  
 During the 2020–21 evaluation cycle the FedCSIS conference series has obtained category B  in the CORE ranking.  We are very proud that we have reached this recognition, while not being part of earlier ranking. This shows that we have developed a valuable scientific event. This also gives us guidance how to proceed to obtain even higher ranking in the next round.  
   
 2021: adjusting conference name  
 FedCSIS conference series is evolving with the world. This evolution is based on recognizing changes in the world around us. One of them is the raise of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics. As a result, it is our belief that “information systems” of the old are becoming “intelligence infused systems” of today. As a matter of fact, it becomes difficult to point to information systems that do not contain components realizing some form of, broadly understood, artificial intelligence. Hence, we have decided that from this year on the name of the conference series will become “Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS)”. As can be seen, we are the same FedCSIS, but adjusted to the world of 2020s.  
 2021: Professor Zdisław Pawlak Award becomes an all-FedCSIS recognition  
 The Zdzisław Pawlak Awards   have been always of great importance for the FedCSIS community. In his research, late Professor Pawlak – undoubtedly one of the fathers of computer science and intelligence systems – has always emphasized a need of cross-disciplinary, cross-country and cross-generation cooperation. Therefore, in 2021, we decided to broaden the range of awards and established the following categories as eligible for all Tracks and all Technical Sessions  of the FedCSIS conference:  
 Best Paper Award  (€600): the best out of all papers accepted to the conference; 
  Young Researcher Paper Award  (€400): the best out of papers whereby all authors are younger than 40 years; 
  Industry Cooperation Award  (€400): the best out of papers whereby there are at least two different authors, one working in academia and another one in industry; 
  International Cooperation Award  (€400): the best out of papers whereby there are at least two different authors working in institutions located in two different countries. 
  We believe that all these new categories reflect the principles of Professor Pawlak’s work. This is also the belief of our new long-term strategic partner – the QED Software  company – which co-finances the above awards.  
 2022: anniversaries  
 The FedCSIS story becomes longer and longer. We believe in continuity, tradition and evolution. Accordingly, we appreciate other long-term conference initiatives and we always welcome them if they want to join our FedCSIS community. In 2022, two out of FedCSIS Technical Sessions are particularly worth mentioning with this respect:  
 The first of them is the CS&P  symposium. Although held within FedCSIS for the first time, this is going to be actually the 30th event organized in the CS&P series  !  
 The second anniversary goes back to Professor Zdzisław Pawlak again. In 2022, it is 40 years since he has founded Rough Sets, one of his most recognized achievements. With this respect, it is our great pleasure to re-establish the RSTA  series focused on foundations and applications of this theory.  
 Such anniversaries will always have the very special place in the FedCSIS conference program.

 Overview The 23rd USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST '25) brings together researchers and practitioners to explore new directions in the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of systems related to storage. The program committee interprets storage-related systems broadly: submissions on low-level storage devices, distributed storage systems, information and data management, as well as other systems interconnected with storage are all of interest. The conference will consist of technical presentations including refereed papers and poster sessions. Topics The topics of interest to FAST are various aspects of systems related to storage. These include and overlap with, but are not limited to, the following topics: Archival systems AI for storage and storage for AI Auditing and provenance Big data, analytics, and data sciences Caching, replication, and consistency Cloud, multi- and hybrid-cloud environments Data deduplication and compression Database storage Distributed and networked storage (wide-area, grid, peer-to-peer) Emerging memory hierarchy design Empirical evaluation Experience with deployed systems File system design Hardware design and prototypes HPC systems, including parallel I/O Key-value and NoSQL storage Management Memory-only storage systems Mobile, personal, embedded, and home storage Networking Novel and emerging storage technologies (e.g., DNA and glass storage) Performance and QoS Power-aware storage architectures RAID and erasure coding Reliability, availability, and disaster tolerance Search and data retrieval Security  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-05-26

  Call for Proposals: CoNLL Shared Task  
   
 July 27, 2024 | BY Antske Fokkens   
 Event Notification Type:   
 Call for Proposals   

 Contact Email:   
 proposals@signll.org    

 Submission Deadline:   
 Tuesday, 1 October 2024    

 SIGNLL (ACL's Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning) invites proposals for the CoNLL Shared Task 2025.   
 Background   
  Since 1999, CoNLL (the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning) has regularly included a shared task in which training and test data are provided by the organizers, which allows participating systems to be evaluated and compared in a systematic way. Descriptions of the participating systems and an evaluation of their performance are presented both at the conference and in the proceedings.  
 Previous shared tasks   
 Previous shared tasks have been devoted to:  
 Chunking (1999, 2000) 
  Clause identifications (2001) 
  Named entity recognition (2002, 2003) 
  Semantic role labeling (2004, 2005) 
  Dependency parsing (2006, 2007) 
  Joint parsing of syntactic and semantic dependencies (2008, 2009) 
  Hedge detection (2010) 
  Co-reference resolution (2011, 2012) 
  Grammatical error correction (2013, 2014) 
  Universal morphological reinflection (2017, 2018) 
  DMultilingual parsing from raw text to universal dependencies (2017, 2018) 
  Cross-framework Meaning Representation Parsing (2019, 2020) 
  BabyLM Challenge (2023) 
  Submission guidelines   
 For CoNLL-2025 proposals are invited for any shared task involving natural language learning and processing, that will directly contribute to theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics  (rather than driven by particular engineering applications).  
 Proposals should contain the following information:   
 Names and affiliations of the members of the organizing committee (including a designated contact person). 
  Description of the shared task, including its relevance to theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics. 
  Description of the process for selecting, acquiring and preparing the data for training and evaluation, including conditions of availability. 
  Description of the procedure for evaluating the performance of participating systems, including the availability of evaluation software. 
  Description of any ethical or licensing issues that may arise from the organization and participation in the proposed task. 
  Any other relevant information. 
  The exact timeline of the shared task will be determined according to the venue CoNLL will be collocated with (either NAACL, ACL or EMNLP; aiming for ACL)  .  
 Proposals should be submitted by October 1, 2024  .  
 Proposals should be submitted by e-mail to proposals  [at] signll.org   , from the email of the contact person, with the subject “CoNLL-2025 Shared Task Proposal”.  
 A tentative timeline for the CoNLL Shared Task 2025 is as follows:   
 October 1, 2024: deadline for proposals 
  October 15, 2024: confirmation of acceptance 
  December 15, 2024: first version of task website online 
  December 15, 2024: first call for papers out 
  January 30, 2019: all trial datasets (plus documentation and scorer) available 
  February 15, 2025: test data available 
  April 15, 2025: test phase ends 
  April 22, 2025: submission of system description papers 
  Proposals should make clear that a similar schedule can be implemented, especially for the preparation of resources (trial/training/development/test data sets).  
 Proposals should be 2 to 3 pages long, in PDF format. We encourage proposers to include appendices with examples that help understanding the data and type of evaluation.  
 Proposals will be reviewed by the SIGNLL steering committee. Proposers might be contacted during the reviewing period to provide further information. Potential proposers should feel free to indicate the intention to submit by emailing proposals  [at] signll.org   . We are also happy to answer your questions about the process, or to solicit early feedback for a proposal.

 CoNLL 2024   

 May 24, 2024   
 CoNLL is a yearly conference organized by SIGNLL  (ACL's Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning), focusing on theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics. This year, CoNLL will be colocated with EMNLP 2024  . Registrations for CoNLL can be made through EMNLP (workshop 1).  
 Submission page available here  .  
 Papers that have received reviews in current or previous ARR cycles can be committed to CoNLL 2024  here   by August 30, 2024.

 The program for CoNLL 2024 is available here  .  
 Call for Papers  
 SIGNLL invites submissions to the 28th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2024). The focus of CoNLL is on theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics, rather than on work driven by particular engineering applications  . Such approaches include:  
 Computational learning theory and other techniques for theoretical analysis of machine learning models for NLP 
  Models of first, second and bilingual language acquisition by humans 
  Models of sign language acquisition, understanding, and production 
  Models of language evolution and change 
  Computational simulation and analysis of findings from psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic experiments 
  Analysis and interpretation of NLP models, using methods inspired by cognitive science or linguistics or other methods 
  Data resources, techniques and tools for scientifically-oriented research in computational linguistics 
  Connections between computational models and formal languages or linguistic theories 
  Linguistic typology, translation, and other multilingual work 
  Theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches to text generation 
  We welcome work targeting any aspect of language, including:  
 Speech and phonology 
  Syntax and morphology 
  Lexical, compositional and discourse semantics 
  Dialogue and interactive language use 
  Sociolinguistics 
  Multimodal and grounded language learning 
  We do not restrict the topic of submissions to fall into this list. However, the submissions’ relevance to the conference’s focus on theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches  will play an important role in the review process.  
 Submitted papers must be anonymous  and use the EMNLP 2024 template  . Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages  of content plus unlimited space for references. Authors of accepted papers will have an additional page to address reviewers’ comments in the camera-ready version (9 pages of content in total, excluding references). Optional anonymized supplementary materials and a PDF appendix  are allowed. The appendix should be submitted as a separate PDF file (reviewers are not required to consider the materials in the appendix so it should not include any essential content to the understanding of the paper).

  Invited speakers  
   
 Thamar Solorio  (Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, MBZUAI)  
 Title:  Towards AI models that can help us to become better global social beings  
 Abstract:  Cultural norms and values fundamentally shape our social interactions. Communication within any society reflects these cultural contexts. For example, while direct eye contact is often seen as a sign of confidence in many Western cultures, it may be viewed as disrespectful in other parts of the world. Moreover, human-human interactions include so much more than just the words we utter; nonverbal communication, including body language and other cues, provides rich signals to those around us.   
 As vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into user-facing applications, it is becoming relevant to wonder if and to what extent this technology can robustly process these signals. My research group is interested in developing evaluation frameworks to assess the abilities of VLMs concerning interpreting social cues and in developing new approaches that can assist us and, perhaps, enhance our cross-cultural human-human interactions.   
  
 Bio:  Thamar Solorio is a professor in the NLP department at MBZUAI. She is also a tenured professor of Computer Science at the University of Houston. She is the director and founder of the RiTUAL Lab. Her research interests include NLP for low-resource settings and multilingual data, including code-switching and information extraction. More recently, she was moved towards language and vision problems, focusing on developing inclusive NLP. She received a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award for her work on authorship attribution and was awarded the 2014 Emerging Leader ABIE Award in Honor of Denice Denton. She served two terms as an elected board member of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics (NAACL) and was PC co-chair for NAACL 2019. She is an Editor in Chief for the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) initiative and was a member of the advisory board for ARR. She serves as general chair for the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.   

  Lorna Quandt  (Gallaudet University)  
 Title:  Integrating AI-Driven Sign Language Technologies in Education: Recognition, Generation, and Interaction  
 Abstract:  This talk explores integrating AI-driven technologies in sign language research, covering the unique challenges of sign language recognition and generation. Dr. Quandt will explore these cutting-edge considerations through the lens of two research projects, ASL Champ! and BRIDGE. Both projects focus on sign language recognition and generation, which is crucial for advancing interaction in virtual and educational environments. ASL Champ! utilizes a dataset of 3D signs to enhance deep-learning-powered sign recognition in virtual reality. At the same time, BRIDGE extends this work by incorporating both recognition and generation of signs to create a more robust, interactive experience. This dual focus underscores the importance of pursuing recognition and generation in tandem rather than treating them as entirely distinct challenges. By leveraging advances in AI and natural language processing (NLP), we can create technologies that recognize and generate signs and facilitate deeper understanding and use of signed languages. These advancements hold great educational potential, particularly in providing more accessible tools for deaf students and enabling broader instruction in sign language. The talk will also address how these innovations can reshape the NLP field by widening the focus beyond spoken/written language and into multimodal, signed, and nonverbal aspects of language, which can inform all linguistic research.  
 Bio:  Dr. Lorna Quandt is the Action & Brain Lab director at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. She serves as Co-Director of the VL2 Research Center alongside Melissa Malzkuhn. Dr. Quandt is an Associate Professor in the Ph.D. in Educational Neuroscience (PEN) program and the Science Director of the Motion Light Lab. Dr. Quandt founded the Action & Brain lab in early 2016. Before that, Dr. Quandt obtained her BA in Psychology from Haverford College and a PhD in Psychology, specializing in Brain & Cognitive Sciences, from Temple University. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Dr. Anjan Chatterjee. Her research examines how knowledge of sign language changes perception, particularly visuospatial processing. Dr. Quandt is also pursuing the development of research-based educational technology to create new ways to learn signed languages in virtual reality.

 General Information  
 The Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR was run every two years starting 2003, becoming the premier conference for practical data systems work. From 2020 on, the conference is organized every year, alternating between Amsterdam and the USA. CIDR 2025 will be held in Amsterdam.  
 The CIDR program consists of single-track keynote, paper and demo presentations. There are also evening sessions, including a lively gong show, and plenty of time for interaction among the delegates, who are researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry. CIDR encourages papers about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insight resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. Papers are encouraged to present novel approaches to data systems architecture and usage, to inspire discussions on the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field. Authors are encouraged to submit their best systems work, and are limited to submit at most two papers.  
 Please check the Call for Papers  for more information on important dates and submission guidelines.

  Important Dates  
 (all deadlines are 11:59pm Pacific Time)  August 2nd, 2024:  submission deadline for all contributions  October 4th, 2024:  author notification for all contributions  January 19-22, 2025:  conference    
  Overview  
 The annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference, complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field.  
 We invite contributions on novel approaches to data management systems, architecture, and usage including cloud based systems for data processing as well as related system issues such as data storage, networking, hardware acceleration, custom processors, memory hierarchies processor interconnects, etc. in the context of data processing. We also encourage new approaches to data management and system building based on or in support of ML/AI technologies. CIDR encourages contributions about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insights, resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based insight, and vision.  
 CIDR 2025 invites two kinds of contributions:  
 Papers (at most 6 pages). We invite both regular research papers and more visionary papers that promote interesting ideas and ongoing work. 
  Demos (a video or a description of the demo in at most 6 pages). 
  To encourage authors to submit only their best work, each person can be an author or co-author of at most one  submission of any kind   . Authors who feel their work is best captured through a demo should submit a demo proposal. Demos and papers will be interweaved in a single-tracked program.  
 Papers, and demos will be reviewed by the program committee, who will select the final program in co-operation with the organizing committee.  
 The number of participants at CIDR is limited to allow an intimate single-track experience. In the past, CIDR reached maximum capacity several weeks before the conference. As in the past, registration for the 2025 conference will be carried out in two phases. Authors who co-authored a paper or demo submission are invited to register first. Then, registration is on a first-come-first- serve basis until the conference capacity is reached.  
 Submission  
 Papers should be electronically submitted in PDF format to CMT  .  
 Similarly to previous years, conference submissions must be formatted using the double-column ACM sigconf style   (see the ACM Template  ), and must not exceed 6 pages in length including all references and appendix   . Videos can be submitted in HTML or MPEG format. Submissions will be reviewed by the program committee which will make acceptance and rejection decisions. Final versions of accepted submissions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the CIDR conference and by the VLDB Endowment. The final versions of accepted papers and demos have no page limit and can be significantly expanded from the submitted form. At least one author of an accepted paper or demo will be expected to attend the conference in person to present the paper. For accepted papers and demos with several co-authors, the program committee reserves the right to select the co-author who should present the paper at the conference as a condition of acceptance (this typically means a senior author will be chosen as the presenter).  
 Camera-Ready Guidelines  
 Camera-ready papers need to follow the formatting instructions above. Additionally, they need to include the following copyright notice at the bottom left of the first page:  
 This paper is published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0) license. Authors reserve their rights to disseminate the work on their personal and corporate Web sites with the appropriate attribution, provided that you attribute the original work to the authors and CIDR 2025. 15th Annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR '25). January 19-22, 2025, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.   
 This LaTeX style file  and this Word template file  include the copyright notice. We recommend that you use them. Both will display the copyright notice.  
 Diversity and Inclusion  
 As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) are crucial for the data management community. Please refer to D&I in DB  for the details of the coordinated D&I efforts across our community. Paper writing can make a material difference. So, we would like to strongly plead with the authors to follow the D&I writing instructions  when drafting the paper submissions.

 Welcome Message from ICIN 2025 Chairs    
 It is with great pleasure to welcome you to The 28th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks  (ICIN 2025)  which will be held from March 11 to 14, 2025 in Paris, France  
 Digital transformation is at the heart of our society. This evolution is made possible by the deployment of a network, computing and service infrastructure that is highly sophisticated in terms of its size, the diversity of its components and the range of uses it allows. Such an infrastructure is made of a large set of heterogeneous hardware/software components resulting in a system of systems whose availability, reliability, performance, interoperability and energy efficiency are becoming major challenges. In order to overtake them, there is a need to automate the full cycle of the continuum. A special focus will be set on the conference theme “ Towards full life cycle automation in the IoT-edge-cloud continuum  ”.   
 Interested authors are invited to submit papers presenting novel technical research, business studies in impact, or mechanisms and new technologies, as well as broader position and visionary papers. Contributions that discuss lessons learnt and best practices, describe practical deployment and implementation experiences as well as demonstrating innovative use-cases are also encouraged.
