 The International Conference on Computational Science  is an annual conference that brings together researchers and scientists from mathematics and computer science as basic computing disciplines, as well as from other various application areas, who are pioneering computational methods in sciences such as physics, chemistry, life sciences, and engineering, as well as in arts and humanitarian fields, to discuss problems and solutions in the area, identify new issues, and shape future directions for research.  
 ICCS 2025 in Singapore, will be the twenty-fifth edition in this series of highly successful conferences.  
 Since its inception in 2001, ICCS has attracted increasingly higher quality and numbers of attendees and papers. The average attendance each year is about 350 participants. The proceedings series have become a major intellectual resource for computational science researchers and serve to define and advance the state of the art of the field. An archive of the previous meetings is available through the Previous ICCS conferences page  .  
 Out of the submitted full papers to the main conference and workshops, we will select some 30% high-quality papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings. These are published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series  and indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services  . The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers.  
 As the conference theme this year is “Making Complex Systems tractable through Computational Science”  , papers highlighting the role of Computational Science in tackling the complex problems of today and tomorrow are particularly welcome.  
 This conference will be a unique event focusing on recent developments in: scalable scientific algorithms; advanced software tools; computational grids; advanced numerical methods; and novel application areas. These innovative novel models, algorithms and tools drive new science through efficient application in areas such as physical systems, computational and systems biology, environmental systems, finance, and others.  
 ICCS is co-organised with the Workshops on Computational Science, a set of thematic satellite events that focus on particular aspects of computational science. These workshops provide a way to explore novel areas of computational science and bring communities together around particular sub-topics of the field. For more information please see the call for workshops.  
 ICCS is committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion in the conference, without regard to race, age, religion, ethnicity, nationality, ability, gender identity, sexual orientation, or gender expression.  
 We look forward to welcoming you to ICCS 2025 in Singapore!

 ICCS is co-organised with the Workshops on Computational Science, a set of thematic satellite events that focus on particular aspects of computational science. You can submit your paper to either the Main Conference or any of the Workshops via the same EasyChair link. You can also choose to submit a Full/Short Paper  or an Abstract  . Please see the table above for the differences between each submission type.  
 Do also note that:   
  1.  ICCS and WCS (Workshops on Computational Science) papers will be published in separate proceedings, that is, there will be a LNCS publication for the Main Conference, and a different LNCS publication for the Workshops. But both ICCS and WCS will be published by LNCS, and indexed in the same way.  
  2.  The only difference between Full and Short papers is the number of accepted pages. They are otherwise published and indexed in the exact same way.  
 While we encourage full paper submissions, the “ Abstract Only  ” option caters to researchers who can only publish in specific journals or work for companies in circumstances such that they cannot publish at all, but still want to present their work and discuss it with their peers at ICCS. In the “Abstract Only” option, a short abstract is included in the conference program, but not in LNCS.  
 After the conference, the best papers will be invited for a special issue of the Journal of Computational Science  (Impact Factor: 3.1)  
  Instructions for Authors  
 The manuscripts of up to 15 pages  , written in English  and formatted according to the Springer LNCS templates, should be submitted electronically via EasyChair.  .  
 The most recent versions of the Templates  are available for download from this link  .  
  The LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates  are also available in the scientific authoring platform Overleaf.  
  Please also make sure to follow Springer’s authors’ guidelines  , as well as Springer’s Book Authors’ Code of Conduct  .  
 Papers must be based on unpublished original work and must be submitted to ICCS only. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper.   
 Do also note that ICCS lays crucial emphasis on the explicit relevance of submitted contributions to Computational Science  . All submissions to the conference, whether to the main conference or to the workshops, will be evaluated for this relevance (through a mandatory field in the submission form). Papers that are more relevant to specialized conferences on very specific topics will be desk-rejected before the standard review process begins.  
 To promote open science and to facilitate reproducibility, ICCS encourages data and code sharing. Please keep this in mind when submitting your papers.  
 Deadlines  for draft paper submission, notification of acceptance, camera-ready paper submission and registration may be found in the Important Dates  section.  
 For the camera-ready version, please note that:   
 ICCS authors interested in | open access for their papers (open choice) | have the possibility to do so. When you submit your camera-ready paper, if you intend to make it open access, | contact us | and we will tell you how to proceed. 
  Springer encourages authors to include their | ORCIDs | in their papers. 
  Springer is now offering the inclusion of | embedded videos | in proceedings papers.

 ICIDS Interactive Storytelling  

 International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling  
 From 2001 to 2007, two European conference series addressed the open challenges of Interactive Storytelling, serving as annual meeting points for scientists, researchers and developers from diverse disciplines.  
 In 2008, these conferences merged into ICIDS: the International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling.  
 In 2018, the Association for Research in Digital Interactive Narratives (ARDIN) was formed. ARDIN ( https://ardin.online/  ) supports research into Interactive Digital Narratives (IDN). ICIDS is the main academic conference of ARDIN.  
 This page provides information related to these conference series.  
 Published rules for the ICIDS review process are available here  (PDF).

 In this editorial, the quintessential requirements for successful interactive story systems are examined and discussed. As part of the discussion, a brief prescription for interactive story research and development is suggested.   

 Interactive Narrative, Plot Types, and Interpersonal Relations    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.6-13 

 The design of an interactive narrative begins with the choice of a type of story. In this paper I examine the potential of three kinds of plot for active user participation: the epic plot, which focuses on the struggle of the individual to survive in a hostile world, the dramatic plot, which deals with the evolution of a network of human relations, and the epistemic plot, which is propelled by the desire to solve a mystery. I distinguish two basic types of immersion—ludic and narrative, the latter subdivided into spatial, temporal and emotional variants, and I discuss the ability of the three kinds of plot to generate these various forms of immersion.

  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.32-40 

 Interactive storytelling is an interesting cross-disciplinary area that has importance in research as well as entertainment. In this paper we explore a new area of interactive storytelling that blurs the line between traditional interactive fiction and collaborative writing. We present a system where the user and computer take turns in writing sentences of a fictional narrative. Sentences contributed by the computer are selected from a collection of millions of stories extracted from Internet weblogs. By leveraging the large amounts of personal narrative content available on the web, we show that even with a simple approach our system can produce compelling stories with our users.

 Jan 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.41-43 

 Locating Drama is a collaborative project between the Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts at Middlesex University and the BBC Radio Drama department. The aim of the project is to investigate narrative strategies that utilise locative technologies principally GPS enabled devices, without being tied to a specific location, allowing listeners to experience immersive, location-aware (but non-location-specific) dramas in suitable locations near their homes, which may eventually be downloaded as interactive pod-casts from the BBC website. The demonstration will present a working drama originally produced for the BBC’s Free Thinking festival 2008.

 Nov 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.51-54 

 This paper reflects on the design and production of an multimodal, environmental storytelling experiment constructed in the first-person game engine Source. Rather than being based around the resolution of conflicts and acheiving goals, Dear Esther presents a sparse environment with no embedded agents, relying purely on the player’s engagement with and interpretation of a narrative delivered through semi-randomised audio fragments. Dear Esther was released for free download via a number of modding sites in June and this paper reflects on the experience of building and the response by gamers.

  pp.59-70 

 Many projects featuring intelligent virtual agents have emerged in last years, but not many reports on their advances in education. This paper presents the curricula of a university course on Modelling Behaviour of Human and Animal-like Agents, including a seminar in which students develop their own virtual agents using a toolkit we have developed. This course has been also scaled for a workshop with computer science high-school students. An evaluation of the course is presented and main lessons learned overviewed. The paper also explicitly formulates the teaching methodology underpinning the course and outlines several general questions hoping to start a broader discussion on educational issues related to the field of intelligent virtual agents.   

 Exploring Non-verbal Behavior Models for Believable Characters    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.71-82 

 Believable characters constitute an important component of interactive stories. It is, therefore, not surprising to see much research focusing on developing algorithms that enhance character believability within interactive experiences, such as games, interactive narrative, and training environments. These efforts target a variety of problems, including portraying and synchronizing gestures with speech, developing animation tools that allow artists to manipulate and blend motions, or embed emotions within virtual character models. There has been very little research, however, devoted to the study of non-verbal behaviors, specifically mannerisms, patterns of movement including postures, gaze, and timing, and how they vary as a function of character attributes. This paper presents a work in progress of a study conducted to (1) identify key character characteristics recognized by animators using an acting model, and (2) formalize non-verbal behaviors patterns that animators use to express these character characteristics.   

 Revisiting Character-Based Affective Storytelling under a Narrative BDI Framework    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.83-88 

 Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) is a well-known cognitive theory, especially in the field of Software Agents. Modelling characters using software agents has been proven to be a suitable approach for obtaining emergent and autonomous behaviours in Interactive Storytelling. In this paper it is claimed that an effective extension of previous models to the BDI framework is useful for designing intelligent characters. An example shows how internal thoughts and motivations of Madame Bovary’s main characters can be more naturally formalised as a cognitive side of the story. A narrative reformulation of BDI theory is needed to avoid the implicit complexity of other proposals.   

 VirtualActor: Endowing Virtual Characters with a Repertoire for Acting    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.89-91 

 The research project VirtualActor will develop Virtual Actors, with focus on creating linear 3D stories. Virtual Actors are virtual characters that can follow abstract directions on how to act, in analogy to a real actor that follows commands of a movie director. The Virtual Actors will be part of a framework called Creactor, which will enable Virtual Actors that employ different AI technologies to be used together, thus providing a test-bed for virtual actor technologies. The authoring process will encompass innovative features that support an iterative and intuitive production of CG-movies. An important technology to be tested for virtual actor behavior control will be Case-Based Reasoning which shall allow exploring the concept of a “repertoire” of behaviors for a virtual actor.   

 Steps towards a Generic Interface between Interactive Storytelling Applications and Character Animation Engines    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.92-95 

 We present first results for the development of a general interface to believable agents. Central element of our approach is CharanisML, a character animation system meta language, which draws from a number of previous proposals for the description of interactive 3D content. To demonstrate the general character of this interface, we implemented two different clients in 2D and 3D that are able to interpret CharanisML. These clients may be adapted as animation engines for interactive digital storytelling engines like Scenejo. Using CharanisML it is possible for an author to control characters independently from both, storytelling engines and two or three-dimensional representations.

  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.96-107 

 The topic of interactive narrative has been under research for many years. While there has been much research exploring the development of new algorithms that enable and enhance interactive narratives, there has been little research focusing on the question of how players understand and internalize their interactive narrative experiences. This paper addresses this problem through conducting a phenomenological study on participants playing Façade; we specifically chose a phenomenological methodology due to its emphasis on the participants" lived experience from the participants" viewpoint. We chose Façade, because it is the only accessible example of an experience that revolves around social relationships, conflict, and drama as its core mechanics. In this paper, we discuss sixteen themes that resulted from the analysis of the data gathered through the study. In addition, we reflect on these themes discussing their relationship to participants" backgrounds, and project implications on the design of future interactive narratives.   

 Play and Narration as Patterns of Meaning Construction: Theoretical Foundation and Empirical Evaluation of the User Experience of Interactive Films    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.108-113 

 The central scope of the research project is a theoretical qualification (and empirical evaluation) of play and narration as different patterns of meaning construction. Based on cognitive film theory and theories of play an opposing specification of playful and narrative perception patterns is developed. Playful and narrative meaning construction are understood as interdependent constructs whose interferences/ interactions are to be analyzed. The theoretical concept is empirically surveyed by comparing the user experiences of a linear fictional film with those of two interactive versions of the same film. The initiating hypothesis is that interactivity enforces playful perception patterns and diminishes the relevance of narrative patterns for the users’ experience.   

 Trying to Get Trapped in the Past --- Exploring the Illusion of Presence in Virtual Drama    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2008 
  Proceedings of the 1st Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling: Interactive Storytelling 
  pp.114-125 

 This article presents the prototype of a virtual cultural heritage installation that employs dramatic storytelling to give visitors a sense of personal presence in a reconstructed historical situation. A cinematic story is delivered through stereoscopic video and spatial audio featuring human actors in a virtual environment. This `light' version of virtual reality offers a chance to study some mechanisms of immersion available to virtual story designers. The immersive effect of stereoscopic vision and 3D audio is explored and opportunities to heighten the effect through dramatic storytelling are discussed. Trading a realtime perspective for the presence of `holographic' human actors, the installation focuses on the impact of dramatic narrative in an immersive environment. The article suggests that virtual storytelling allows designers to take the spectator's illusion of personal concern with the proceedings one step further than traditional drama, enabling the spectator to feel personally present and thus `physically' concerned. The opportunities and limitations of this spatially `situating' effect are evaluated in the context of the installation.   

 The Functions of Music in Interactive Media

  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008 
  pp.126-131 

 In this media theoretical and critical elaboration we intend to close the gap between music in static linear and non-linear interactive media. We will give a brief overview on media music perception and its historical development that enables us to recognize parallels between music in films and games and, thereby, uncover future perspectives of interactive media music. According to this, we will elaborate its narrative functions and potentials in order to widen the scope of the field where music meets interactivity.   

 Adaptive Musical Expression from Automatic Realtime Orchestration and Performance    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008 
  pp.132-143 

 When scoring an interactive scene or narration music has to follow its events and development organically. Approaches toward musical nonlinearity are needed. Therefore, the means of orchestration and expressive performance provide a big potential that has not been tapped even a little yet. In this paper we will show how to translate them into the interactive context. But to change musical expression it is not feasible to simply switch hard between different instrumentations and performative styles. We introduce and discuss a new style-independent method for organic and musically believable transitions of compositional and performative expression characteristics.   

 Narrative Generation for Suspense: Modeling and Evaluation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2008 
  Interactive Storytelling, First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008, Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings 
  pp.144-155 

 Although suspense contributes significantly to the enjoyment of a narrative by its readers, there has been little res earch on the automated generation of stories that evoke specific cognitive and affective responses in their readers. The goal of this research is to deve lop and evaluate a system that produces a narrative designed specifically to evoke suspense from the reader. The system takes as input a plan data structure rep resenting the goals of a storyworld's characters and the actions they perfor m in pursuit of them. Adapting theories developed by cognitive psychologists, the system uses a plan-based model of narrative comprehension to determine the final content of the story in order to manipulate a reader's level o f suspense in specific ways. This paper outlines the various components of the s ystem and describes an empirical evaluation. The evaluation provides stron g support for the claim that the system is effective in generating suspenseful s tories.   

 A Use of Flashback and Foreshadowing for Surprise Arousal in Narrative Using a Plan-Based Approach

 This paper describes work currently in progress to develop a computational method for generating flashback and foreshadowing specifically targeted at the evocation of surprise in the reader’s mind. Flashback provides a backstory to explain what caused the surprise outcome. Foreshadowing provides an implicit hint about the surprise. Our study focuses on surprise as a cognitive response rather than as an emotional response. The reader’s story construction process is simulated by a plan-based reader model that checks unexpectedness and postdictability of the surprise.   

 Story Planning with Vignettes: Toward Overcoming the Content Production Bottleneck

 Storytelling is prominent part of the daily lives of humans. Entertainers, educators, and trainers often concern themselves with the production of novel stories for entertainment, education, and training. However, it is possible for the consumption of story content by end-users to outpace the rate of production of story content. One solution is to instill greater creativity in computer systems in the form of story generation. We present an incremental advancement to planning-based story generation that increases the space of narratives that can be automatically searched in an attempt to make planning-based story generation more creative. The VB-POCL story planning algorithm implements a form of case-based planning that can incorporate vignettes – plot fragments that are a priori known to be “good” – into a narrative planning process. We show that VB-POCL can generate narratives with favorable structural properties that cannot be generated reliably with previous attempts at planning-based narrative generation.

 A common problem in creating interactive drama is the au- thoring bottleneck. If pre-authored stories are directly incorporated into an interactive virtual environment then there is a need to consider all possible interactions and story twists, which for a sizeable drama is in- feasible. One proposed solution to this problem is to use search and planning algorithms along with narrative structures. This leads to a huge state space and planning becomes intractable for real-time solutions. A way to address this problem is to distribute the story planning to au- tonomous characters so that the drama emerges from their interactions. However without predened structure or directives the drama is unlikely to emerge into the intended story or even the intended genre. We propose to divide the drama into narrative episodes which we call schemas. Schemas are used by a director and a set of actors to struc- ture the drama so that it emerges into a fully developed drama. The schemas are pre-authored in an abstract way such that they can be de- ployed multiple times in the same drama, which removes the authoring bottleneck. In this article, we dene the structure of the schemas and how the director and actors use schemas in Directed Emergent Drama (DED).

 A growing research community is working towards employ- ing drama management components in interactive story-based games. These components gently guide the story towards a narrative arc that improves the player's experience. In this paper we present our Drama Management architecture for real-time interactive story games that has been connected to a real graphical interactive story based on the An- chorhead game. We also report on the natural language understanding system that has been incorporated in the system and report on a user study with an implementation of our DM architecture.

 Interactivity, coherence and diversity of the stories are key issues for the development of interactive storytelling systems. When stories are to be told via interactive TV, special interaction methods are also necessary in order to cope with high responsiveness requirements. In this paper, we describe the ex-tension of the interactive storytelling system Logtell we have developed to run in an interactive TV environment. Planning algorithms have been applied to provide coherence and diversity for the stories at levels of both plot composi-tion and dramatization. A new architecture was designed to combine these algo-rithms with special interaction methods incorporated to achieve high respon-siveness.   

 Exploiting Structure and Conventions of Movie Scripts for Information Retrieval and Text Mining

 Movie scripts are documents that describe the story, stage direction for actors and camera, and dialogue. Script writers directors, and cinematographers have standardized the format and language that is used in script writing. Scripts contain a wealth of information about narrative patterns, character direction, blocking, and camera control that can be extracted for various applications in interactive storytelling. In this short paper, we propose the creation of an automatically annotated corpus of movie scripts and describe our initial efforts in automating script annotation. We first describe the parts of a movie script that can be automatically annotated and then describe the use of an existing language processing toolkit to automatically annotate specific parts of a movie script.

 This paper describes the analysis of the narrative generation aspect of the Generator of Adaptive Dilemma-based Interactive Narratives (GADIN). This system automatically generates narratives that are focused around dilemmas to create dramatic tension. The dilemmas are based on those clichés encountered in many of today’s soap operas. A story planner creates sequences of actions that lead to dilemmas for storyworld characters. A narrative generated by GADIN is compared to that which took place in a television soap opera. The stories were subjected to a Turing-style test, with 127 participants, which showed that the readers could not determine which narrative had been written by a computer.

 In this paper we address the issue of how to transform a set of actions and behaviors generated by autonomous characters into a meaningful and interesting story. To do that, we consider the issues involved in developing an architecture that is generic enough to be applied to entertainment/educational applications that convey stories through the interactions between intelligent graphical characters and a user. As such, issues in organizing the emergent content are discussed and a generic story facilitator (a kind of game master) is described. Finally two storytelling applications that use the architecture are described demonstrating the generality of the approach.

 Of all forms of storytelling, interactive storytelling presents authors with a unique opportunity: while most traditional stories must rely on having general high appeal, the nature of interactive stories to encourage audience interaction allows aspects of each individual’s state to be automatically inferred. Given such information, an author’s decisions would become more informed, and his ability to affect the audience would be improved. In this paper, we present an analysis of the decision-making process in interactive storytelling, and construct a method for characterizing storytelling systems based on features of their design. We demonstrate our method by comparing four recently published systems, and review related literature on inferring player information. Finally, we present Delayed Authoring, a new perspective on the design of interactive storytelling systems which takes advantage of their opportunity to make stories player-specific.

 Abstract. Multi-player role-playing games form one of the key examples of interactive, emergent and collaborative storytelling systems available. These games and the collaborative stories that they create, are commonly facilitated by a specialized participant, the game master. In the current study, the verbal communication of game masters in a series of role-playing game sessions is categorized and analyzed depending on form and content, using protocol analysis, establishing a model for the verbal communication of game masters.

 One common metaphor for Interactive Storytelling has been the notion of Interactive Dramas, in which players assume the first-person role of the main character in a digitally mediated narrative. In this paper we explore the model of improvisation as a means of understanding the relationship between the author/designer and the reader/player of such narratives. This model allows for a new formulation of the notion of agency, by shifting the concept of the reader from a player-centric model to a performer-centric model. We also show how we can conceive of interactions between performers and authors as being governed by the same rules that are in play between multiple performers in a piece of improvisational theatre. We connect this idea to a phenomenological theory of human computer interaction and cognition which foregrounds the role of communication and commitment between interactors.

 We describe how autonomous character agents that inhabit a story world can make (out-of-character) decisions about its details filling in the story world as they go. We describe how we model these kind of late commitment decisions, and discuss how we use them to support action selection and to justify the adoption of character goals. Although a rigorous evaluation remains future work, we have implemented the approach presented here and have performed some exploratory testing.

 We highlight some of the characteristics of existing technical approaches to the management of interactive experiences and motivate computational models of influence, a technique we are developing to aid drama managers in the persuasion of players to make decisions that are consistent with an author’s goals. Many of the existing approaches to managing interactive experiences have focused on the physical manipulation of the environment, but we argue instead for the use of theories from social psychology and behavioral economics to affect the adoption of specific goals by the player.

 Emergent narrative (EN) is a narrative concept in virtual reality that relies on emergence for a flexible shaping of stories as opposed to fixed pre-determined plots. This has consequences for the creative role of the author in an EN system. In this paper, we aim to clarify the actual function of the author by investigating what is exactly mediated in ENs and how this can be filled in by an author at design time.

 Recent progress in Interactive Storytelling has been mostly based on the development of proof-of-concept prototypes, whilst the actual production process for interactive narratives largely remains to be invented. Central to this effort is the concept of authoring, which should determine the relationships between generative technologies underlying Interactive Storytelling engines, and the actual description of narrative content. In this paper, we report the development of an authoring technology on top of a fully-implemented Interactive Storytelling system. Although this system originated as a debugging tool for a Planning system, its interactivity as well as the high-level nature of the formalism it manipulates makes it a candidate to support collaboration between authors and technologists.

 The advances in computing technologies enable the computer users to create and share their own stories to the community at large. However, it is still regarded as complicated and laborious to author interactive narratives, where a story adapts as the user interacts with it. In authoring interactive narratives, two main approaches—branching graphs and AI planning—have been significantly used to augment interactivity into conventional linear narratives. Although each approach offers its own possibilities and limitations, few efforts have been made to blend these approaches. This paper describes a framework for authoring interactive narratives that employs an adapted branching narrative structure that also uses planning formalism to enable automated association between nodes. We expect that our work is valuable for non-expert users as well as AI researchers in interactive storytelling who need to create a large quantity of story contents for varied endings for a story.

 Multi-player Role-Playing Games form rare examples of interactive, collaborative storytelling systems, especially within the tabletop format. However, despite recent advances in the theory and general knowledge of the field, models of the operation of the storytelling process in multi-player non-digital role-playing games remains relatively unspecific. In this paper, a critical synthesis of the available theory is combined with observations from a series of experiments, in a detailed model for the gaming process.

 Role-Playing Game Mastering is one of the most cited examples of "ordinary life Interactive Storytelling" in scientific literature. There are some computer interfaces for game mastering, but most of them are designed as part of the toolkits that are used to control low-level events of specific videogame engines. In this paper a more abstract application has been developed, an intelligent graphic interface that allows human Game Masters to direct stories in virtual environments from a more comfortable and narration-oriented point of view.   

 StoryTec: A Digital Storytelling Platform for the Authoring and Experiencing of Interactive and Non-linear Stories

  Proceedings of the 1st Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling: Interactive Storytelling 

 Recently, within the information society and the upcoming, prospering creative industries, a lot of research has been investigated into Storytelling systems and authoring tools for the creation and representation of Storytelling based scenarios in a broad range of application domains, e.g. marketing and advertisement, training and simulation, ELearning, edutainment, serious games. Prominent examples are the EU funded projects U-CREATE, nm2 and INSCAPE, whose global aim was to allow even non-specialists the easy and efficient creation of interactive stories for various application domains. Based on the achieved RTD results of these projects, this paper introduces StoryTec as Digital Storytelling platform for the authoring and experiencing of interactive, non-linear stories. Apart from a brief description of the StoryTec platform as a whole and the difference to the INSCAPE approach, this paper focuses on two specific modules: The Story Editor and ICML as standardized descriptive format for any interactive stories.

 Interactive storytelling is also possible without a computer. Even a theatre play doesn’t need to be based on a predefined text in order to be performed. A storyline in an improvisational play evolves dynamically from the input of the audience from actions of the facilitator and from spontaneous ideas of the actors and actresses. The audience becomes an interactive element and - potentially - the actual author of the story. However, this doesn’t mean that an Impro theatre play would not need a predefined concept. Also, the players and performers need at least basic training in the skills for impromptu acting. Even the development of a story that unfolds right in the moment of the performance needs basic assumptions. [1][2]

 Over the last 30 years, a phenomenon of human-to-human interactive storytelling has developed, known as fantasy role-playing games (RPG), beginning with the publishing of the game Dungeons & Dragons in 1974. Since then, a role-playing culture has emerged, incorporating concepts from theatre, board games, history reenactment and storytelling, remixed in an almost post-modern way.

 At TIDSE 2006, we conducted a pre-conference demo workshop [1] that addressed the issue of developing accessible solutions for the creation of interactive storytelling artworks and applications. As a principle of the workshop, participants demonstrated their authoring systems using a shared story: the Grimm’s fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood. They were allowed to change and adapt the initial story in order to meet the underlying technical philosophy of their system, and in order to introduce interactivity. This exercise quickly made obvious that a) - not surprisingly - there are several ways and strategies to make a story interactive, and b) that the creative approaches suggested by these systems differ fundamentally, making it hard to get an integrated picture of ‘Interactive Storytelling’ from a creator’s point of view.

 ... While many authors focus on the player role in their definition of interactive narrative, other researchers point out the important role of the narrative or 'system' itself. They describe interactivity in storytelling as a cyclic process between agents: each agent (the user and the system) alternately listens, reflects and speaks (Crawford, 2008)  . This inclusion of the system as an active agent, brings the work of the designer/writer of the interactive narrative into focus. ...

 Digital simulations and scenario-based learning programmes are widely accepted as an effective educational approach where experiential learning is key. However, there is an acknowledged need to improve the narrative design of these educational interventions to make them both engaging for the learner and aligned with learning goals. This study turns for guidance to the expertise of narrative designers for games, where storytelling for interactive narrative has a long history of testing, iterating and perfecting. A collection of proven techniques described by game narrative practitioners will inform creative writing efforts to craft prototypes to test the transferability of those techniques to interactive narratives in a healthcare education context.

 Within Entertainment Computing, games research has grown to be its own area, with numerous publication venues dedicated to it. As this area evolves, it is fruitful to examine its overall development—which subcommunities and research interests were present from the start, which have come and gone, and which are currently active—to better understand the research community as a whole and where it may proceed. In this paper, we present a data-driven analysis and interactive visualization tool to shed light on how technical domains within the games research field have evolved from 2000 - 2013, based on publication data from over 8,000 articles collected from 48 games research venues, including Entertainment Computing, FDG, AIIDE, and DiGRA. The approach we present is descriptive. We first used data mining algorithms to group related papers into clusters of similar research topics and evolve these clusters over time. We then designed an interactive visualization system, named Seagull, comprised of Sankey diagrams that allow us to interactively visualize and examine the transition and coalescing of different clusters across time. We present our descriptive analysis in this paper and also contribute the visualization interface to allow other researchers to examine the data and develop their own analysis.

 The metaverse represents a post-reality universe that seamlessly merges physical reality with digital virtuality. It provides a continuous and immersive social networking environment, enabling multi-user engagement and interaction through Extended Reality (XR) technologies, which include Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). As a novel solution distinct from traditional methods such as mobile-based applications, the technical affordance of XR technologies in shaping multi-user social experiences remains a complex, multifaceted, and multivariate issue that has not yet been thoroughly explored. Additionally, there is a notable absence of mature frameworks and guidelines for designing and developing these multi-user socio-technical systems. Enhancing multi-user social engagement through these technologies remains a significant research challenge. This systematic review aims to address this gap by establishing an analytical framework guided by the PRISMA protocol. It analyzes 88 studies from various disciplines, including computer science, social science, psychology, and the arts, to define the mechanisms and effectiveness of XR technologies in multi-user social engagement. Quantitative methods such as descriptive statistics, correlation statistics, and text mining are used to examine the manifestation of mechanisms, potential system factors, and their effectiveness. Meanwhile, qualitative case studies identify specific measures by which system factors enhance multi-user social engagement. The study provides a pioneering framework for theoretical research and offers practical insights for developing cross-spatiotemporal co-present activities in the metaverse. It also promotes critical reflection on the evolving relationship between humans and this emerging digital universe.

 Building on the work series of Belitung VR, this article seeks to explore a narrative framework for digital cultural heritage storytelling. Belitung VR is a serious game to disseminate Belitung-related cultural knowledge in VR, where users can freely explore in the reconstructed Arab dhow shipping between China and West Asia to collect clues to the causes of the wreck. The proposed framework consists of narrative goals (the physical and meta-physical), narrative elements (character, world and plot), and narrative grammar (immersion, interaction, rhetoric and factuality). This work can serve as a practice guide and evaluative framework for designers/artists with an aspiration to digitally disseminate cultural heritage.

 In a society where advances and innovations occur on a daily basis, outreach and meaningful engagement with the general public become more challenging. The amount of information produced and repackaged surpasses existing systems in place to ensure truthful and factual engagement with the public, especially with complex matters regarding health science. This perspective paper discusses the value of contextualization and optimization for creating transparent and engaging content. We reflect on the innovative Transformative Storytelling Technique as a new category-creating hybrid content to guide audiences' experience, starting with the case of informal caregivers helping individuals living with neurological conditions. Moreover, we share our perspective on the important considerations for current and future development of highly targeted content using this technique. We include reflections around the risks and ethical principles needed in the utilization and dissemination of “guided” content for the general public.

 There is a long history of research exploring how augmented and mixed reality systems can be used to support visitors to cultural heritage locations, but the technological or application specific focus of much of this research means that our understanding of how these experiences work is more of a collection of insights, rather than a coherent theory about how the elements of the experience come together. There is a danger that without developing this knowledge further, our systems will be technologically complex, but experientially simplistic. In this article, we explore how one form of mixed reality experience, digital locative storytelling, can impact the experience of place, and in turn how place impacts the experience of story. We have analyzed 33 interviews, and 25 participant observations from 12 story deployments at 2 different sites. Our findings confirm that locative storytelling experiences not only impart information to readers, but also help them to rediscover familiar places and see hidden relationships—especially through time. But our findings also show how the success of the experience is reliant on the balance of attention between the virtual and real (the story and the place), and that issues with navigation, social interactions, and technology are problematic because they can disrupt this balance. Digital locative experiences therefore need to be designed carefully in order to create a balance of attention (e.g., by aligning the elements of the story with the topology and character of place). We call this a state of Loco-Narrative Harmony, in which place and story are working together and reader attention is balanced, creating an effect that is greater than the sum of its parts.

  Students learn by doing, but convincing them to ‘do’ is not always easy. While simulations can be an excellent tool for interpreting, discussing, and experiencing political concepts and ideas, they can only be successful if they engage the classroom. This paper seeks to help scholars construct increasingly immersive, relevant, and educational simulations by developing a conceptual framework for ... [Show full abstract]  creating and running simulations. It is organized in three parts. First, it offers a summary of a successful semester-long simulation of political behavior taught at a small liberal arts institution to non-political science majors. This course was organized into two-week thematic Units, which were in turn broken into halves. In the first half of each Unit, students learned in a traditional setting of reading, discussion, and lecture. In the second half, lessons and ideas were applied in weeklong simulations designed by the instructor. To accomplish this, students were permanently divided into groups of five which comprised ‘countries.’ Within these countries, each student was given a specialized role designed to suit their personality, such as military commander, artisan, or leader. These positions correlated to specific tasks within each simulation, as well as specific graded work that was rolled into a portfolio due the close of class. The nature of simulations varied from week to week. Countries were asked to confront a variety of challenges, including tackling domestic tragedies of the commons, designing regimes, attempting to build IGOs, and crafting political ideologies. Simulations were linked so that the outcome of one simulation affected outcomes in another. To heighten student interest and imagination, countries were also forced to contend with an ever-growing viral outbreak that transformed populations into zombies — an accessible proxy for any number of international and domestic crises with which governments regularly contend. By the second week of the course, the classroom resembled an international community — an ideal laboratory to explore questions of ideology, rationality, and strategy. The simultaneously cooperative and competitive aspects of simulations drove students to voluntarily form working groups out of class, develop complex propaganda campaigns, and continue to simulate events via e-mail between simulation weeks. Classroom engagement was extraordinary, student satisfaction very high, and student performance on exams and written assignments superlative. Next, drawing on analysis of this successful experience, this paper presents a framework for understanding simulation. This framework stresses four elements: accountability, artistry, immersion, and incentives. This paper argues that successful simulation construction is heavily dependent upon properly incorporating these elements into scenario design. First, to help ensure initial engagement, students must be held accountable for their participation in a concrete and measurable way. Second, instructors should recall that simulations require imagination, and that imagination is best fostered through creative artistry in scenario design. Third, simulations are most effective when they are pervasive — everything from instructions, evaluations, gameplay, and classroom etiquette should be conducted within the language of that simulation. Finally, simulation designers are advised to focus upon incentive structures embedded within simulations as a simple but important way to channel student behavior.Finally, this paper offers perspective on four successful strategies for managing simulations: adaptability, storytelling, consequences, and managing cooperation and conflict. In order to ensure productive simulation flow, instructors must be able to adapt to classroom mood. Some suggestions are offered to help instructors gauge classroom attitudes and adapt accordingly. As simulations progress, storytelling becomes increasingly important to maintain immersion; this paper provides advice on how to convert student work and actions into a cohesive and digestible storyline that is excellent fodder for serious discussion. Further, students are most deeply engaged when they feel that their actions in the simulated world have consequences, and so this paper provides examples of methods that make students feel that their decisions have impact. Finally, this paper offers some advice about managing cooperation and conflict — which, when balanced properly, are important tools to promote engagement as well as topics of learning in themselves.

 Sound Practices to Effectively Perform Electrolyte Leakage Assays, Poster Board #239   
 July 2013    
 Ayako Kusakabe 
  Juan Carlos Melgar 
  The effectiveness of electrolyte leakage assays was tested in order to develop simple and sound procedures and to evaluate cold tolerance in fruit tree research studies. Divergences in specific methodological details that may impact the accuracy of these types of assays have been found in the literature. In this methodological study, leaves from grapefruit trees grown in the field were used to ... [Show full abstract]  evaluate: 1) the adequate ratio between the number of leaf disks and the volume of water in a sample tube; and 2) the addition of ice chips. These trials showed that using less than one leaf disk per ml of water per tube resulted in too much variability in electrolyte leakage, which decreased the effectiveness of this method to estimate the lethal freezing temperature. The addition of ice chips into test tubes to nucleate the water-soaked tissues did not have any effect on electrolyte leakage compared to the non-addition of ice chips when this addition was done after the immersion of the test tubes in the refrigerated bath; however, electrolyte leakage was different when the ice chips were added before the immersion of the tubes in the refrigerated bath since the ice melted before leaf disks were subjected to freezing temperatures.

 La cartographie des zones submersibles au Québec. Entre urgence d'agir et défis scientifiques   
 May 2017    
 David Didier

  Dany Dumont 
  Depuis les « grandes marées » de 2010, le Saint-Laurent est très médiatisé : des tempêtes à répétition ont causé des dommages sur les côtes, et plusieurs résidences ont été submergées. Théoriquement, la submersion de 2010 avait une récurrence très faible, supérieure à 100 ans. Or, à la veille de l’année 2017, des submersions extrêmes ont massivement affecté l’Est du Québec en perturbant la ... [Show full abstract]  circulation routière et en causant de forts dommages aux infrastructures. Qu’en est-il de la gestion des zones fortement exposées aux phénomènes météo-marins au Québec, et seront-elles plus exposées dans le futur ? La réponse n’est pas simple. Cartographier les zones inondables le long du Saint-Laurent nécessite de prendre en considération cinq éléments : la morphologie des côtes, les niveaux d’eau (surcote+marée), la hausse appréhendée du niveau marin relatif, les vagues et la glace de mer. L’hétérogénéité des 3 500 km de côtes de l’estuaire et du golfe du Saint-Laurent complexifie cette tâche. L’utilisation de modèles est nécessaire pour déterminer les surfaces submersibles. Les modèles empiriques sont simples, peuvent couvrir de grands territoires, mais sont moins précis. Les modèles numériques intègrent des processus complexes, mais sont plus difficiles à utiliser et demandent plus de ressources. Y a-t-il une solution scientifiquement valable et socialement acceptable face au besoin urgent d’une cartographie de la submersion ? Pour tenter de répondre aux besoins des riverains et acteurs de la gestion du risque, cette présentation synthétise les connaissances sur la cartographie de la submersion par des exemples d’approches préconisées à l’international.

 PROBLEMS IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE BASAL METABOLISM OF MAN AND FACTORS AFFECTING IT   
 January 1970    
 Thorne M. Carpenter 
  Our lives are continually maintained by the processes of heat production. As long as we produce heat, we are alive, and when heat production stops, living ceases. Thus the end result of our various activities is heat production. There is a minimum level of heat production below which we can not live for any length of time. This minimum level of heat pro-*duction is the result of internal ... [Show full abstract]  glandular and cellular activity, and of respiration and circulation. When we measure this heat production with the body in a resting, quiet condition without external muscular activity, and after the effects of the last ingested food have ceased, we call it the basal metabolism. We shall consider in this lecture some of the problems in the measurement of basal metabolism and some of the factors that affect the basal metabolism. Effect of neutral bath. Ordinarily the basal metabolism is measured with the subject in a comfortable condition so far as the sensation of cold or warmth is concerned. In the laboratory this usually means with the ordinary clothing and, if the temperature is about 20° Centigrade, there may be a light covering of blankets. Usually, however, the amount of clothing and covering of the subject during basal metabolism measurements is not reported by the investigator, and Lefevre (1) has criticized this procedure. He maintained that in practically all basal metabolism measurements, as ordinarily made, the conditions for heat loss are such that the metabolism is higher than the true basal. According to him the true basal metabolism can be obtained only when the subject is immersed in a water bath at 35° to 36° C, because under other conditions there will be an excess heat production to combat the loss of heat to the environment. To meet this criticism tests were made by F. G. and C. G. Benedict (2) with several subjects in which the basal metabolism was first determined 315 316 THORNE M. CARPENTER Vol. XXXIII with the subjects lying clothed and lightly covered at a tem-perature of 15°, in order to accentuate the possible influence of a cool environmental temperature. After these measure-ments were made, the subjects entered a neutral bath at 34° to 35° C. in a warm room and the observations were repeated under these conditions. The results in Table I indicate that there was no decrease in the metabolism due to immersion in a bath at nearly body temperature. If anything, there was a slight tendency to an increase in the metabolism. After the bath the subject's metabolism returned to the basal value quickly. The con-tention of Lefevre was thus not substantiated. It is obvious that the determination of basal metabolism by immersion in a TABLE I.

  Artigo Completo A evolução das novas tecnologias permitiu a publicação de livros em formatos digitais e interativos. A categoria de ebook interativo destaca-se por explorar recursos de multimídia, interatividade e potencialidades específicas dos dispositivos digitais para contar histórias. Em um ebook interativo os diversos tipos de interatividades podem potencializar a imersão por meio de ... [Show full abstract]  agenciamento de ações e transformações ocorridas, assim como os resultados das ações do leitor. No entanto, caso as informações interativas não estejam coerentes com os acontecimentos da narrativa, o agenciamento do leitor poderá não contribuir para imersão no conteúdo, desviar sua atenção e dificultar a compreensão da história. O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar os tipos de interatividades que podem contribuir para a imersão em uma narrativa digital. Para tanto, a partir de uma abordagem exploratória e qualitativa, analisou-se o book app Jack and the Beanstalk na perspectiva das categorias estéticas da narrativa digital interativa: imersão, agência e transformação (MURRAY, 2003; RYAN, 2009; TANENBAUM, 2007), frente a aos tipos de interatividades comuns em narrativas digitais (MILLER, 2014). Observou-se que é fundamental alinhar a interatividade de forma significativa tendo em vista as consequências coerentes aos acontecimentos da história e assim possibilitar um maior envolvimento do leitor com o conteúdo. Artigo Completo The development of new technology has allowed the publication of books in digital and interactive formats. The interactive ebook category stands out to explore multimedia features, interactivity and the potential of digital devices for storytelling. In the children''s book app, an interactive ebook in application format, the various types of interactivity can enhance the immersion through agency actions and changes occurring as a result of player''s actions. However, if the interactive information is not consistent with the narrative of events, the agency reader can’t contribute to the immersion in the content, diverting his attention from the text and making it difficult to understand the story. The objective of this study was to determine the types of interactivity that can contribute to the immersion in a digital narrative. Therefore, from an exploratory and qualitative approach, was analyzed the book app Jack and the Beanstalk from the perspective of aesthetic categories of interactive digital narrative: immersion, agency and transformation (MURRAY, 2003; RYAN, 2009; TANENBAUM, 2007 ), compared to the common types of interactivity in digital storytelling (Miller, 2014). Noted that it is critical to align the interactivity significantly in view of the consequences consistent with historical events and thus enable a greater involvement of the reader to the content.

 Welcome Message from ICIN 2025 Chairs    
 It is with great pleasure to welcome you to The 28th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks  (ICIN 2025)  which will be held from March 11 to 14, 2025 in Paris, France  
 Digital transformation is at the heart of our society. This evolution is made possible by the deployment of a network, computing and service infrastructure that is highly sophisticated in terms of its size, the diversity of its components and the range of uses it allows. Such an infrastructure is made of a large set of heterogeneous hardware/software components resulting in a system of systems whose availability, reliability, performance, interoperability and energy efficiency are becoming major challenges. In order to overtake them, there is a need to automate the full cycle of the continuum. A special focus will be set on the conference theme “ Towards full life cycle automation in the IoT-edge-cloud continuum  ”.   
 Interested authors are invited to submit papers presenting novel technical research, business studies in impact, or mechanisms and new technologies, as well as broader position and visionary papers. Contributions that discuss lessons learnt and best practices, describe practical deployment and implementation experiences as well as demonstrating innovative use-cases are also encouraged.

 About ICIN Conference    
 Since 1989, the ICIN conferences have been bringing together leading internet and telecom experts from industry, academia, and government from across the globe. ICIN is a single-track conference that is both intimate and global, attracting 100+ delegates, from more than 20 countries. It focuses on leading-edge investigations into Internet technologies from basic networking and cloud services to novel architectures. ICIN uses a rigorous peer-review process and has become an established industry forum to discuss emerging trends in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). It offers an agora for one on one discussions and cross-fertilization between participants and leading network visionaries with the goal of promoting dialogue and ideation about the current and future trends in networking research and development. ICIN conferences are well known for their identification of research challenges and industry trends and their discussion on the impact of cutting-edge technologies on future intelligent and distributed networking and related computing services. ICIN has an enviable track record of identifying key technology and service – and analyzing their impact on business models – before they become widely recognized in the industry and government communication sectors. The interdisciplinary approach and the cross-fertilization of ideas are the main ingredients that made ICIN a recognized event in the cloud networking and Internet communities.  
 ICIN now a recognized event in its domain and successive venues have been as follows:

IEEE ICIP 2025, a flagship conference of the IEEE Signal Processing Society explores the latest technical innovations in image and video processing and covers cutting-edge topics involving computer vision.  
 Authors are encouraged to take note of the new conference initiatives, below, when preparing submissions.  
 Options to submit longer in-depth papers – IEEE ICIP track extended to five pages + one page for references, submission of IEEE ICIP papers of up to eight pages + one page for references to the Open Journal of Signal Processing, and presentation options for previously accepted journal papers 
  Spotlight Oral Sessions highlighting top papers with exceptional maturity and/or novelty 
  Top accepted papers with exceptional maturity and/or novelty as determined by the program committee, will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers for expedited review in select SPS journals 
  Rigorous review process using double-anonymous review and an author rebuttal period 
  Expanded scope through satellite workshops and special sessions 
  The IEEE ICIP program will feature insightful short courses and tutorials, engaging exhibits and demonstrations, satellite workshops by leading tech companies, career development opportunities, and networking events for practicing engineers, aspiring students, and young entrepreneurs.  
 IEEE ICIP 2025 offers several ways for authors to present their latest research:   
 1. Submit a conference paper  – Up to five pages for technical content and a sixth page containing only references. To maximize visibility and impact, accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® digital library and will be freely accessible and downloadable by all, in final format, beginning one month prior to the conference and through the conference end date (Open Preview). Top papers will be highlighted in Spotlight Oral Sessions along with an invitation to submit an extended version of the paper for expedited review in select SPS journals. Some top  accepted papers with exceptional maturity and/or novelty as determined by the program committee, will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers for expedited review in select SPS journals  .   
 2. Submit a journal paper to the IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing (OJ-SP)  – Submit up to eight pages of technical content and one page for references; for publication in the IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing (OJ-SP), the completely open-access journal of the SPS, instead of in the conference proceedings. Papers submitted to OJ-SP prior to the advertised submission deadline that are designated as being intended for presentation at the conference will receive expedited review to ensure that a decision is available in time for inclusion in the conference program. The article processing charge (APC) for open-access publication is paid after acceptance.  
 3. Present an accepted or published SPS journal paper  – Authors who have published or accepted a paper(s) in an eligible journal within the last year may submit an SPS Journal Paper Presentation Request to present the paper(s) at the conference.

    24th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks (ICIN 2021)   
  
 The theme of the conference for 2021 is the melding of network and computing services that is clearly demonstrated by the increasing softwarization of the network services in the the core and the access networks, the rise of computing in the network and the growth of cognition in networking for management and control as well as for value added services at the edge and in the data center. Several innovations are impacting the ongoing transformations toward the network of the future and the evolution of cloud services. More and more the network fabric itself emcompasses functionality usually associated with computing as increased intelligence and cognition are necessary to address emerging requirements of distributed services, automation and network reliability. At the same time, more and more, the cloud is extending to the edge adding a number of heterogeneous networked subsystems to the Internet with a variety of requirements that further highlight the need for novel architectures , e.g., IoT systems, augmented and virtual reality and service delivery platforms. The result is the networking and computing systems becoming one, melding, as a distributed cloud/edge continuum with cognition and intelligence for emerging services. This “Computing and Networking as a Service” is the paradigm that will be central to the deployment of immersive services in many different sectors, such as e-health, self-driving cars, industrial networks, agriculture and cloud robotics.  
 In this scenario and considering the many challenges that the aforementioned  
 paradigms and technologies will bring, the theme for ICIN 2021 is proposed as:  
 “ Services everywhere: melding networking and computing in an intelligent cloud-edge continuum  ”  
  
 The conference will foster discussion about new ideas and novel approaches for future service delivery in the emerging scenario of immersive intelligence. With this vision, the conference will look beyond the current state of the art and promote the advances of Computing as a Service technologies for different application service delivery platforms.  
 Interested authors are invited to submit papers presenting novel technical research as well as broader position and visionary papers. Contributions that discuss lessons learnt and best practices, describe practical deployment and implementation experiences as well as demonstrating innovative use-cases are also and especially encouraged.  
 ICIN 2021 is technically co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE ComSoc.  
  All accepted & presented papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.  
 The best technical papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an extended version for fast-track review in the following journals:  
 IEEE Transactions on Network Service and Management (Impact Factor: 3.878) 
  MDPI Sensors (Impact Factor: 3.275) 
  Particularly innovative and visionary papers will be invited to submit a magazine-style version suitable for a wider audience to:  
 IEEE Communications Magazine (Impact Factor: 11.052)

 IEEE Privacy Policy:  https://www.ieee.org/security-privacy.html   
 Refund Policy:  All registration fees covering a paper are non-refundable. For registration fees not covering a paper, a full refund, after a US$50 (equivalent) processing fee, will be given, provided the request is applied for prior to the last day of the Advance Registration deadline.  
 Author Registration:  Each accepted paper must be covered by at least one non-student registration by ( DATE TBD  ), and one non-student registration can cover up to four papers.  
 Non-Presented Paper (No-Show) Policy   : Any accepted paper included in the final program is expected to   have at least one author or qualified proxy attend and present the paper at the conference. If a paper is not   presented at the conference, the paper will not be published by IEEE on IEEE Xplore® or other public access   forums, but these papers will be distributed to conference attendees as conference proceedings and the   copyright of these papers will belong to IEEE. For poster sessions, if the speaker is not present in front of the   poster for most of the time during the poster session, this also implies the paper was not presented.   Conference organizers are required to collect attendance records and a list of any non-presented papers   and submit to IEEE SPS staff.    
 Exceptions to this policy will be made by the Technical Program Chair(s) of the conference only if there is evidence that the no-show occurred because of unanticipated events beyond the control of the authors, and every option available to the authors to present the paper was exhausted. The no-show authors may appeal the decision of the Technical Program Chair to the VP-Conferences.  
 Qualified Proxy Policy:  The presentation of papers by substitutes is highly discouraged and may only be made after permission is granted by the Technical Program Chair(s) of the conference based on solid evidence that none of the authors is available to present. Papers presented by substitutes without permission will be considered as no-shows.  
 Authors with Travel Restrictions Policy:  The Signal Processing Society values diversity. Authors who anticipate inability to travel to a conference because of a government-imposed travel restriction are still encouraged to submit papers. Such papers will be reviewed and accepted on their own merit for publication without any knowledge of the author’s travel restriction. Within one week of paper acceptance notification, travel-restricted authors must notify the Technical Program Chair of the conference with proof of their restriction. Substitute presenters may be possible or, depending on conference resources, other accommodations may be available, such as a remote presentation or pre-recorded video.

 Due to the perduring COVID-19 pandemic and taking into account the current contamination numbers in France, ICIN 2022 will be held as a virtual conference on March 07-10, 2022.    
 25th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks (ICIN 2022)    
 On behalf of the Organizing and Technical Program Committees, we are pleased to welcome you to the 25th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks (ICIN 2022)  will be held from March 7 to 10, 2022 in Paris, France.  
  For the 2022 edition, ICIN is focusing on the move towards “NextG” and the upcoming 6G that is clearly up-to-the-minute and probably happening faster than expected now that initial 5G deployments are a reality. The need for ambient connectivity at the network edge requires novel thinking and the already engaged convergence between Network, IT and Cloud systems is still an enabler for efficient cooperation between all network technologies (wireless, optic, satellite, IoT and low-power, etc). These tendencies are aligned with the growing adoption of cognitive approaches for management and control, as well as for specific services at the edge and at critical technical domains using highly optimized deployment models in terms of resource and energy use.  
 Several innovations are impacting the ways to address emerging requirements from all sectors of the social and economical domains (health, environment, agriculture, industry, banking, etc.) that are also evolving with digitalization. The extraction of valuable and tailored services along with the extension of the network reach and the software-based automation of its operation are 3 main axes to which schemes for high reliability and adaptability are extremely needed to capitalize on the openness and heterogeneity that beyond 5G and 6G networks would drive.  
 While pushing towards super connectivity, including responsible and social-oriented evolutions of networks is structural. In addition to technical drivers, addressing social aspects will be important for 6G. In this regard, there is a need for rethinking the requirements and use cases along with the evolution in all the above-mentioned sectors and rely on a variety of complementary mechanisms enabling the new generation of network and service offerings to act for a human then a digital world.  
  Considering the many challenges that the aforementioned paradigms and technologies will bring, the theme for ICIN 2022 is:  
 “Paving the way to an inclusive and sustainable 6G”    
 The conference will foster discussion about new ideas and novel approaches for future 6G networks and services and their enabling technologies and mechanisms in the emerging scenario of immersive connectivity, security and intelligence. With this vision, the conference will look beyond the current state of the art and promote the advances of network of networks with control and management approaches that foster reliability and optimality for applications and services that leverage societies and business.  
 Interested authors are invited to submit papers presenting novel technical research, research related to business impact or mechanisms of new technologies, as well as broader position and visionary papers. Contributions that discuss lessons learnt and best practices, describe practical deployment and implementation experiences as well as demonstrating innovative use-cases are also and especially encouraged.  
 ICIN 2021 is technically co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE ComSoc and ACM SIGMOBILE In-Cooperation.  
  All accepted & presented papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.  
 The best papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an extended version for fast-track review in the following journals:  
 IEEE Communications Magazine (Impact Factor: 10.356) 
  IEEE Transactions on Network Service and Management (Impact Factor: 4.682) 
   
 We are honored to organize ICIN 2022 in Paris, France and we are looking forward to your contributions to the continued success of the conference!

 The 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)  will take place in Anchorage, Alaska, USA, one of the most fascinating hidden gems of North America. IEEE ICIP 2025, a flagship conference of the IEEE Signal Processing Society explores the latest technical innovations in image and video processing and covers cutting-edge topics involving computer vision.  
 Authors are encouraged to take note of the new conference initiatives, below, when preparing submissions.  
 Options to submit longer in-depth papers – IEEE ICIP track extended to five pages + one page for references, submission of IEEE ICIP papers of up to eight pages + one page for references to the Open Journal of Signal Processing, and presentation options for previously accepted journal papers 
  Spotlight Oral Sessions highlighting top papers with exceptional maturity and/or novelty 
  Top accepted papers with exceptional maturity and/or novelty as determined by the program committee, will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers for expedited review in select SPS journals 
  Rigorous review process using double-anonymous review and an author rebuttal period 
  Expanded scope through satellite workshops and special sessions 
  The IEEE ICIP program will feature insightful short courses and tutorials, engaging exhibits and demonstrations, satellite workshops by leading tech companies, career development opportunities, and networking events for practicing engineers, aspiring students, and young entrepreneurs.  
 IEEE ICIP 2025 offers several ways for authors to present their latest research:   
 1. Submit a conference paper  – Up to five pages for technical content and a sixth page containing only references. To maximize visibility and impact, accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® digital library and will be freely accessible and downloadable by all, in final format, beginning one month prior to the conference and through the conference end date (Open Preview). Top papers will be highlighted in Spotlight Oral Sessions along with an invitation to submit an extended version of the paper for expedited review in select SPS journals. Some top  accepted papers with exceptional maturity and/or novelty as determined by the program committee, will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers for expedited review in select SPS journals  .   
 2. Submit a journal paper to the IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing (OJ-SP)  – Submit up to eight pages of technical content and one page for references; for publication in the IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing (OJ-SP), the completely open-access journal of the SPS, instead of in the conference proceedings. Papers submitted to OJ-SP prior to the advertised submission deadline that are designated as being intended for presentation at the conference will receive expedited review to ensure that a decision is available in time for inclusion in the conference program. The article processing charge (APC) for open-access publication is paid after acceptance.  
 3. Present an accepted or published SPS journal paper  – Authors who have published or accepted a paper(s) in an eligible journal within the last year may submit an SPS Journal Paper Presentation Request to present the paper(s) at the conference. For eligibility requirements, visit the IEEE Signal Processing Society  website under the “ Journal Paper Presentation at SPS Conferences and Workshops  ” section to view the criteria for eligibility.
