  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference is vital for its role in uniting computer science, biology, and bioinformatics. It accelerates discovery by leveraging intelligent systems to analyze complex molecular data, enabling precision medicine and revolutionizing drug discovery. ISMB addresses big data challenges, educates researchers, and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, making it a critical hub for advancing life science research and applications.  
 ISMB is the flagship meeting of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) and has become the leading global conference in the field. 2025 marks the 33rd year of ISMB and is combined with the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB), which is in its 24th year. The ISMB/ECCB conference series aims at attracting the top research contributions in all areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. Typical, but not exclusive, the topics of interest are: sequence analysis, evolution and phylogeny, comparative genomics, protein structure, molecular and supramolecular dynamics, molecular evolution, gene regulation and transcriptomics, proteomics, Systems biology, ontologies, databases and data integration, text mining and information extraction, and human health. The conference also aims to attract participants from related disciplines in order to understand the need that exists for computational approaches in related fields, and to gain from approaches taken in other disciplines that might be appropriate for computational biology.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.  
 - top -   
   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.   
    
 - top -   
   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.  
 - top -   
   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.

   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

  Call for Papers 
  The 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) will be held in Koblenz, Germany, (June 10-11, 2025) as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).  
 Aims and scope   
 The European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches.  
 Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results.  
 In the technical track, we invite high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results related to MBE.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:  
 Foundation Papers | , dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects. 
  Application Papers | , dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place. 
  Submission process   
 Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template ( https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip  ) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken.  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.  
 All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair (link to be published).  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Foundations of MBE | , including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc. 
  Novel paradigms | , formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc. 
  Interplay between MBE with and for | AI-based systems. 
  Application of MBE methods | , tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT. 
  Successful use of MBE | in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance. 
  Educational aspects of MBE. 
  Tools | and | initiatives | for the successful | adoption of MBE in industry. 
  Review criteria and process   
 The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigour, and suitability for the conference.  
 Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected.  
 Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission. Revisions that significantly lessen the contribution of the work or fail to address the reviewers’ original concerns adequately will result in the paper’s rejection. Papers not accepted but with a sufficient level of quality may be encouraged to be re-submitted next year, or alternatively as regular JOT articles, hence continuing their review process through the normal journal channels.  
 Papers will be published in the JOT journal as soon as they are accepted and one of their authors registers at the conference.  
 Artifacts   
 Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication.  
 Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.

 Topics   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following subjects:  
 General models of graph transformation (e.g. adhesive categories and hyperedge replacement systems) 
  Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems 
  Graph-based machine learning, including graph neural networks and models of rule inference 
  Graph theoretical properties of graph languages 
  Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages 
  Logical aspects of graph transformation 
  Computational models based on graphs 
  Structuring and modularisation of graph transformation 
  Hierarchical graphs and decomposition of graphs 
  Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformation 
  Term graph and string diagram rewriting 
  Petri nets and other models of concurrency 
  Business process models and notations 
  Bigraphs and bigraphical reactive systems 
  Graph databases and graph queries 
  Model-driven development and model transformation 
  Model checking, program analysis and verification, simulation and animation 
  Syntax, semantics and implementation of programming languages, including domain-specific and visual languages 
  Graph transformation languages and tool support 
  Efficient algorithms (e.g. pattern matching, graph traversal, network analysis) 
  Applications and case studies in software engineering (e.g. software architectures, refactoring, access control, and service-orientation) 
  Applications to computing paradigms (e.g. bio-inspired, quantum, ubiquitous, and visual) 
  Graph transformation and artificial intelligence (e.g., AI for graph transformations, applying graph transformations in AI engineering and search-based software engineering) 
  Important Dates   
 Abstracts: 28 Jan 2025 
  Paper Submission: 4 Feb 2025 
  Notification: 25 Mar 2025 
  Final version due: 15 Apr 2025 
  Conference: within 10-13 Jun 2025 
  All deadlines are by end-of-day, AoE  
 Submission Types   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. We are currently in discussion whether to go Open Access for ICGT 2025. We will update and detail the calls as soon as possible.  
 (1) Regular research papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), including papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (2) Tool presentation papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description (up to XX pages) which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings.  
 (3) Blue Skies  (up to XX pages), reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories.  
 Furthermore, there will also be a Journal-First track  allowing for previously published work (in book chapters, journals, or other conferences since 2021) to be presented at ICGT 2025.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA).

 The European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches.  
 Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results.  
 In the technical track, we invite high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results related to MBE.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:  
 Foundation Papers | , dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects. 
  Application Papers | , dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place. 
  Submission process   
 Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template ( https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip  ) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken.  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.  
 All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair (link to be published).  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Foundations of MBE | , including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc. 
  Novel paradigms | , formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc. 
  Interplay between MBE with and for | AI-based systems. 
  Application of MBE methods | , tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT. 
  Successful use of MBE | in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance. 
  Educational aspects of MBE. 
  Tools | and | initiatives | for the successful | adoption of MBE in industry. 
  Review criteria and process   
 The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigour, and suitability for the conference.  
 Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected.  
 Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission. Revisions that significantly lessen the contribution of the work or fail to address the reviewers’ original concerns adequately will result in the paper’s rejection. Papers not accepted but with a sufficient level of quality may be encouraged to be re-submitted next year, or alternatively as regular JOT articles, hence continuing their review process through the normal journal channels.  
 Papers will be published in the JOT journal as soon as they are accepted and one of their authors registers at the conference.  
 Artifacts   
 Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication.  
 Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.

 Call for Full Papers  

 Call for Full Papers   
 The European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is the prime European forum for the presentation of original research in the field of Information Retrieval.   
 Topics of Interest   
 ECIR 2025 invites the submission of high-quality and original papers in the broad field of Information Retrieval – this primarily includes textual or textual with multimodal information. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:   
 Search and ranking, | including retrieval models and ranking, query and content analysis, web search, and theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval; 
  User aspects in IR | , including information interaction, contextualisation, personalisation, simulation, characterisation, and behaviours; 
  System aspects | , including retrieval and recommendation architectures, efficiency and scalability; 
  Conversational search and recommender systems | , focusing on natural language understanding and generation, dialogue management, multimodal interaction, and user engagement in search processes; 
  Explainability methods | , addressing the transparency, interpretability, and accountability of AI-driven systems, particularly for information retrieval, recommendation, and personalisation; 
  Machine Learning and Large Language Models | for information retrieval and recommendation; 
  Applications | , such as web search, recommender systems, web and social media apps, professional and domain-specific search, novel interfaces to search tools, intelligent search, and conversational agents; 
  Evaluation research | , including new metrics and novel methods for the measurement and evaluation of retrieval and/or recommendation systems, users, and/or applications; 
  New social and technical challenges in IR | , such as bias, ethics, fake news, and hate speech, IR-focused trustworthy & explainable AI methodologies and techniques. 
  Full Paper Track   
 The Full Paper Track provides the opportunity for researchers to present their state-of-the-art research in Information Retrieval, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.   
 Full papers are up to | 12 pages in length | plus additional pages for references. Appendices count toward the page limit. Please put appendices | before | the references for paper submission. 
  Full papers will be refereed through | double-blind peer review | , with an initial first-stage review followed by a second stage of discussion led by a meta-reviewer. 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word (to be found at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   ), for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers (  https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid   ).   
 All submissions must be written in English. All papers should be submitted electronically through the EasyChair submission system (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecir2025   )   
 In addition, the corresponding author of each accepted paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the paper has been submitted, changes relating to its authorship cannot be made.   
 Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The proceedings will be distributed to all delegates at the conference. Accepted papers will have to be presented at the conference by one of the authors in person – and at least one author for each accepted contribution will be required to register and attend.   
 Dual Submission Policy   
 Papers submitted to ECIR 2025 should be substantially different from papers that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that are under review at other venues. Exceptions to this rule are:   
 Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings. 
  Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report (e.g., in institutional archives or preprint archives like arXiv). However, we discourage this since it places anonymity at risk; in particular, please do not publish your paper at arXiv and submit it to ECIR at the same time, some days before, or during the reviewing period of ECIR. If your paper already is available as a technical report, you might not want to use the exact same title and abstract for your ECIR submission (in case of acceptance at ECIR, the title of your submission still might be changed back). 
  Please do not cite your technical report and make some effort to avoid any issues that may harm the double-blindness of your submission. Reviewers will receive guidance that ask them to refrain from trying to break blindness if at all possible too, but be aware that the availability of an available technical report for an ECIR submission can cause issues. 
  Ethics and Professional Conduct   
 ECIR 2025 expects authors (as well as the PC, and the organising committee) to adhere to accepted standards on ethics and professionalism in our community, namely:   
 The | ACM’s Policy on Authorship | , 
  The | ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct | , 
  The | ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy Against Harassment | .

 Call for Full Papers  

 Call for Full Papers   
 The European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is the prime European forum for the presentation of original research in the field of Information Retrieval.   
 Topics of Interest   
 ECIR 2025 invites the submission of high-quality and original papers in the broad field of Information Retrieval – this primarily includes textual or textual with multimodal information. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:   
 Search and ranking, | including retrieval models and ranking, query and content analysis, web search, and theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval; 
  User aspects in IR | , including information interaction, contextualisation, personalisation, simulation, characterisation, and behaviours; 
  System aspects | , including retrieval and recommendation architectures, efficiency and scalability; 
  Conversational search and recommender systems | , focusing on natural language understanding and generation, dialogue management, multimodal interaction, and user engagement in search processes; 
  Explainability methods | , addressing the transparency, interpretability, and accountability of AI-driven systems, particularly for information retrieval, recommendation, and personalisation; 
  Machine Learning and Large Language Models | for information retrieval and recommendation; 
  Applications | , such as web search, recommender systems, web and social media apps, professional and domain-specific search, novel interfaces to search tools, intelligent search, and conversational agents; 
  Evaluation research | , including new metrics and novel methods for the measurement and evaluation of retrieval and/or recommendation systems, users, and/or applications; 
  New social and technical challenges in IR | , such as bias, ethics, fake news, and hate speech, IR-focused trustworthy & explainable AI methodologies and techniques. 
  Full Paper Track   
 The Full Paper Track provides the opportunity for researchers to present their state-of-the-art research in Information Retrieval, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.   
 Full papers are up to | 12 pages in length | plus additional pages for references. Appendices count toward the page limit. Please put appendices | before | the references for paper submission. 
  Full papers will be refereed through | double-blind peer review | , with an initial first-stage review followed by a second stage of discussion led by a meta-reviewer. 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word (to be found at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   ), for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers (  https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid   ).   
 All submissions must be written in English. All papers should be submitted electronically through the EasyChair submission system (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecir2025   )   
 In addition, the corresponding author of each accepted paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the paper has been submitted, changes relating to its authorship cannot be made.   
 Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The proceedings will be distributed to all delegates at the conference. Accepted papers will have to be presented at the conference by one of the authors in person – and at least one author for each accepted contribution will be required to register and attend.   
 Dual Submission Policy   
 Papers submitted to ECIR 2025 should be substantially different from papers that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that are under review at other venues. Exceptions to this rule are:   
 Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings. 
  Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report (e.g., in institutional archives or preprint archives like arXiv). However, we discourage this since it places anonymity at risk; in particular, please do not publish your paper at arXiv and submit it to ECIR at the same time, some days before, or during the reviewing period of ECIR. If your paper already is available as a technical report, you might not want to use the exact same title and abstract for your ECIR submission (in case of acceptance at ECIR, the title of your submission still might be changed back). 
  Please do not cite your technical report and make some effort to avoid any issues that may harm the double-blindness of your submission. Reviewers will receive guidance that ask them to refrain from trying to break blindness if at all possible too, but be aware that the availability of an available technical report for an ECIR submission can cause issues. 
  Ethics and Professional Conduct   
 ECIR 2025 expects authors (as well as the PC, and the organising committee) to adhere to accepted standards on ethics and professionalism in our community, namely:   
 The | ACM’s Policy on Authorship | , 
  The | ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct | , 
  The | ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy Against Harassment | .

However, we discourage this since it places anonymity at risk; in particular, please do not publish your paper at arXiv and submit it to ECIR at the same time, some days before, or during the reviewing period of ECIR. If your paper already is available as a technical report, you might not want to use the exact same title and abstract for your ECIR submission (in case of acceptance at ECIR, the title of your submission still might be changed back). 
  Please do not cite your technical report and make some effort to avoid any issues that may harm the double-blindness of your submission. Reviewers will receive guidance that ask them to refrain from trying to break blindness if at all possible too, but be aware that the availability of an available technical report for an ECIR submission can cause issues. 
  Ethics and Professional Conduct   
 ECIR 2025 expects authors (as well as the PC, and the organising committee) to adhere to accepted standards on ethics and professionalism in our community, namely:   
 The | ACM’s Policy on Authorship | , 
  The | ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct | , 
  The | ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy Against Harassment | .

  Call for Papers 
  The 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) will be held in Koblenz, Germany, (June 10-11, 2025) as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).  
 Aims and scope   
 The European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches.  
 Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results.  
 In the technical track, we invite high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results related to MBE.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:  
 Foundation Papers | , dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects. 
  Application Papers | , dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place. 
  Submission process   
 Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template ( https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip  ) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken.  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.  
 All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair (link to be published).  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Foundations of MBE | , including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc. 
  Novel paradigms | , formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc. 
  Interplay between MBE with and for | AI-based systems. 
  Application of MBE methods | , tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT. 
  Successful use of MBE | in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance. 
  Educational aspects of MBE. 
  Tools | and | initiatives | for the successful | adoption of MBE in industry. 
  Review criteria and process   
 The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigour, and suitability for the conference.  
 Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected.  
 Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission. Revisions that significantly lessen the contribution of the work or fail to address the reviewers’ original concerns adequately will result in the paper’s rejection. Papers not accepted but with a sufficient level of quality may be encouraged to be re-submitted next year, or alternatively as regular JOT articles, hence continuing their review process through the normal journal channels.  
 Papers will be published in the JOT journal as soon as they are accepted and one of their authors registers at the conference.  
 Artifacts   
 Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication.  
 Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.

 Chairs can be contacted using the following email address: ecmfa2025@easychair.org

  ECOOP 2025  ( series  ) /  Technical Papers ECOOP 2025   
   
 Call for Papers   
 ECOOP is a conference about programming originally focused on object orientation, but now including all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. ECOOP solicits innovative solutions to real problems as well as evaluations of existing solutions.  
 Authors are asked to pick one of the following categories:  
 Research. | The most traditional category for papers that advance the state of the art. 
  Replication. | An empirical evaluation that reconstructs a published experiment in a different context in order to validate the results of that earlier work. 
  Experience. | Applications of known PL techniques in practice as well as tools. Industry papers will be reviewed by practitioners. We welcome negative results that may provide inspiration for future research. 
  Pearls/Brave New Ideas. | Articles that either explain a known idea in an elegant way or unconventional papers introducing ideas that may take some time to substantiate. These papers may be short. 
  Submissions   
 Submission must not have been published, or have major overlap with previous work. In case of doubt, contact the chairs. Proceedings are published in open access by Dagstuhl LIPIcs in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs LaTeX-style template  . To reduce friction when resubmitting, ACM’s PACMPL and TOPLAS formatted papers can be submitted as such (with the understanding that if accepted, they will be reformatted).  
 ECOOP uses double-anonymous reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must omit author names and institutions, and use the third person when referencing the authors’ own work. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the FAQ  . If in doubt, contact the chairs.  
 There is no page limit on submissions, but authors must understand that reviewers have a fixed time budget for each paper, so the length of the feedback is likely to be unaffected by length. Brevity is a virtue. Authors also have to consider that the camera-ready version must be (at most) 25 pages  in LIPIcs format (not including references).  
 Authors will be given a three-day period to read and respond to the reviews of their papers before the program committee meeting. Responses have no length limit.  
 ECOOP will continue to have two deadlines for submissions. Papers submitted in each round can be (a) accepted, (b) rejected, or (c) asked for revisions. Rejected papers that are submitted to the immediate next round can be desk-rejected if they do not sufficiently differ from the previous submission. Revisions can be submitted at any later round. Papers retain their reviewers during revision.  
 Review Criteria   
 Each paper will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 Soundness: How well the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods; 
  Significance: The extent to which the paper’s contributions are novel, original, and important, with respect to the existing body of knowledge; 
  Presentation: Whether the paper’s quality of writing meets the high standards of ECOOP. 
  After author response and reviewer discussion, papers will be accepted if the PC decides that the paper meets our high bar for Soundness and Presentation, and if ONE reviewer judges the paper to meet the bar for Significance. The goal of this process is to ensure quality of writing and confidence in results, while assuming that if one reviewer finds the paper to be significant then there will be readers who do so as well.  
 Artifact Evaluation and Intent   
 To support replication of experiments, authors of research papers may submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. They will be asked whether they intend to submit an artifact at submission time. It is understood that some papers do not have artifacts. AEC members will serve on the extended review committee.  
 Journal First and Journal After   
 We have Journal First/After arrangements with ACM’s Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), Elsevier’s Science of Computer Programming (SCP) and AITO’s Journal of Object Technology (JOT).  
 Only new research papers are eligible to be Journal First (JF). JF papers will have an extended abstract in the ECOOP proceedings. The deadline is the same as Round 1 of submissions and the notification is aligned with Round 2 notification. TOPLAS JF papers should be submitted according to this announcement. SCP JF papers should follow this call for papers. JF papers are presented at the conference and eligible for awards.  
 Journal After (JA) papers are papers for which the authors request to be considered for post conference journal publication. Once accepted by the ECOOP PC, these papers will be forwarded to the journal editors. Reviews and reviewers will be forwarded and used at the editor’s discretion. JA papers will have an extended abstract (up to 12 pages) in the conference proceedings.

  Welcome to the 9 th  International Workshop on Context-Oriented Programming   
 Contextual information plays an ever-increasing role in our information-centric world. Current-day software systems adapt continuously to changing execution and usage contexts, even while running. Unfortunately, mainstream programming languages and development environments still do not support this kind of dynamicity very well, leading developers to implement complex designs to anticipate various dimensions of variability.  
 Context-Oriented Programming directly supports variability at the programming level, depending on a wide range of dynamic attributes. It enables run-time behaviour to be dispatched directly on any detected properties of the execution or user context. Since more than a decade, several researchers have been working on a variety of notions approaching that idea. Implementations ranging from first prototypes to mature platform extensions used in commercial deployments have illustrated how multidimensional dispatch can be supported effectively to achieve expressive runtime variation in behaviour.  
 The previous editions of this workshop at ECOOP 2009–2016 have shown to be well-received, each attracting around 30 participants. The goal of the 9th Workshop on Context-Oriented Programming is to further establish context orientation as a common thread throughout language design, application development, and system support.

 Contextual information is playing an ever-increasing role in our information-centric world. Current-day software systems need to adapt continuously to changing execution and usage contexts, even while they are running. Unfortunately, mainstream programming languages and development environments still do not support this level of dynamic adaptivity very well, leading developers to implement complex designs to anticipate various dimensions of variability.  
 Context-Oriented Programming directly supports variability at the programming level, featuring dedicated programming abstractions enabling programmers to write software applications that adapt dynamically to a wide range of dynamic attributes. It enables run-time behaviour to be dispatched directly on any detected properties of the execution or user context. Since more than a decade, several researchers have been working on a variety of notions approaching that idea.  
 Implementations ranging from first prototypes to mature platform extensions used in commercial deployments have illustrated how multidimensional dispatch can be supported effectively to achieve expressive runtime variation in behaviour. Our series of International Workshops on Context-Oriented Programming (COP) at ECOOP 2009–2016 have proven to be very successful, each attracting around 30 participants, so continuing this workshop in 2017 in the beautiful city of Barcelona is an obvious next step to advance this vibrant research domain.  
 Topics   
 Topics of interest to the workshop include, but are not limited to:  
 Interesting application domains and scenarios for COP; 
  Programming language abstractions for COP (e.g. dynamic scoping, roles, traits, prototype-based extensions); 
  Implementation techniques and mechanisms for COP (e.g. different kinds of dynamic, contextual and multi-dimensional dispatch or pre-dispatch); 
  Implementation issues for COP such as optimisation, VM support, JIT compilation etc.; 
  Implemented use cases, case studies or prototypes of COP; 
  Theoretical foundations for COP (e.g., semantics, type systems); 
  Configuration languages (e.g. feature description interpreters, transformational approaches); 
  Interaction between non-functional programming concerns and COP (e.g. security, persistence, concurrency, distribution); 
  Modularisation approaches for COP (e.g. aspects, modules, layers, plugins); 
  Guidelines to include COP in programs (e.g. best practices, patterns); 
  Runtime support for COP (e.g. reflection, dynamic binding); 
  Tool support (e.g. design tools, IDEs, debuggers); 
  Support for COP at the modelling level; 
  Beyond context-oriented behaviour adaptation (e.g., UI adaptation, DB adaptation). 
  Submission guidelines   
 COP invites submissions of high-quality papers reporting original research, or describing innovative contributions to, or experience with context-oriented programming, its implementation, and application. Papers that depart significantly from established ideas and practices are particularly welcome.  
 Submissions must not have been published previously and must not be under review for any other refereed event or publication. The program committee will evaluate each contributed paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality.  
 Papers are to be submitted via EasyChair   . They must be written in English, provided as PDF documents, and follow the new ACM Master Article Template   with the sigconf option. They should not exceed 6 pages  .  
 Dissemination of Workshop results   
 Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.  

 Previous Editions  
   
 This is the 9 th  edition of the COP workshop.  
 In the past, context-oriented programming topics have been presented at several international venues:  
 LASSY, the Live Adaptation of Software Systems workshop (co-located with Modularity or Programming), 
  DLS, the Dynamic Languages Symposium (co-located with OOPSLA, ECOOP or SPLASH), 
  the International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems, 
  the International and Interdisciplinary conference on Modelling and Using Context, 
  the Symposium on Software Variability, and 
  the International Conferences on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organising Systems. 
  As a confirmation of the maturity of the field, papers on Context-oriented programming have also appeared in journals:  
 Elsevier Journal of Systems and Software, 
  ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS), and 
  Elsevier Science of Computer Programming. 
  In our COP workshop series, we aim at broadening the spectrum of application fields, and the International Workshops on Context-oriented Programming we have been organizing at ECOOP since 2009-2016 have proved to be an essential step in achieving that goal successfully.

  37th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS’25)  
 July 8–11, 2025 | Brussels, Belgium | ecrts.org  
  Submission deadline: February 28, 2024 (23:59 AoE)  
  Submission website: tba  
  
   ECRTS is the premier European venue in the area of real-time systems and, alongside RTSS and RTAS, ranks as one of the top three international conferences on this topic. ECRTS has a rich history, with the first edition held in 1989 and this year’s edition being the 37th run of this annual event. As in previous editions, ECRTS attracts researchers from both academia and industry whose work tackles foundational and practical challenges at the intersection of real-time scheduling, time-critical systems, real-time operating systems, hardware/software co-design, security in time-sensitive systems, real-time networking, AI and machine learning methods for real-time systems, and more.   
 ECRTS 2025 will be held as a physical conference on July 8-11, 2025 in Brussels, Belgium.    
 Scope and topics of interest  
 Papers on all aspects of timing requirements in computer systems are welcome. Systems of interest include not only hard real-time systems but also time-sensitive systems in general (e.g., systems with soft requirements expressed in terms of tail latency, latency SLAs, QoS expectations, etc.). Typical applications are found not only in classical embedded and cyber-physical systems, but also increasingly in cloud or edge computing contexts and often stem from domains such as automotive, avionics, telecommunications, healthcare, robotics, and space systems, among others.   
 To be in scope, papers must address some form of timing requirement, broadly construed.  Prospective first-time authors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with works accepted in past editions of the conference, which are publicly available at drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS    
 ECRTS welcomes theoretical and practical contributions (including tools, benchmarks, and case studies) to the state of the art in the design, implementation, verification, and validation of time-sensitive systems. We particularly encourage papers on industrial case studies (such as the examples at  ecrts.org/industrial-challenge   ) and the application of real-time technology to real systems. We welcome practical contributions even without novel theoretical insights or formal proofs, provided they are of interest to the research community and/or industry. Whenever relevant, we encourage authors to present experimental results (preferably based on real data, but synthetic test cases are acceptable when adequately motivated).   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:   
 all elements of time-sensitive | SOFTWARE SYSTEMS | , including operating systems, hypervisors, middlewares and frameworks, programming languages and compilers, runtime environments, networks and communication protocols, etc.; 
  COMPUTER HARDWARE | design and hardware/software integration for embedded systems, including time-predictable hardware architecture, GPU and accelerators, FPGA prototyping, SoC design, novel memory architectures, hardware/software co-design, etc.; 
  REAL-TIME NETWORKS | : including wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN), industrial IoT, Software Defined Network (SDN), 5G, end-to-end latency analysis, etc.; 
  REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS | , including modeling, design, simulation, testing, debugging, and evaluation in domains such as automotive, avionics, control systems, industrial automation, robotics, space, railways telecommunications, multimedia, etc.; 
  foundational | SCHEDULING | and | PREDICTABILITY | questions, including schedulability analysis, algorithm design, synchronization protocols, computational complexity, temporal isolation, probabilistic guarantees, multi-core scheduling, resource co-scheduling, etc.; 
  static and dynamic techniques for | RESOURCE DEMAND ESTIMATION | , including stochastic and classic worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis, analyses to bound memory and bandwidth needs, and methods for determining the energy, power, or thermal footprint of real-time applications, etc.; 
  MACHINE LEARNING | techniques in safety-critical systems, including explainable AI, the application of machine learning to the design and optimization of real-time systems, methods for real-time AI computing, etc.; 
  FORMAL METHODS | for the verification and validation of real-time systems, including model checking, computer-assisted proofs, and runtime monitoring systems, etc.; 
  SECURITY | aspects of real-time systems, including techniques to strengthen security guarantees, concerns that affect the operation of safety-critical systems, privacy-enhancing techniques, methodologies to protect the temporal envelope of critical software against malicious threats, etc.; 
  the interplay of timing predictability and other | NON-FUNCTIONAL QUALITIES | such as reliability, quality of control, energy/power consumption, environmental impact, testability, scalability, etc. 
  The above list of topics is intended only as a coarse summary of recent proceedings and should  not   be understood as an exclusive list of interests. On the contrary,  papers breaking new ground, departing from established subfields, or challenging the status quo are most welcome and highly encouraged.   
  Open access  
 The ECRTS organizers and community strongly believe that a conference best serves the research community and the public when results are accessible to the largest audience without restrictions. In line with this belief, all accepted papers will be published again this year as open-access proceedings in collaboration with LIPIcs (Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics). Once published, the proceedings of ECRTS 2025 will be publicly accessible at  drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS   where the previous proceedings since 2017 are available.   
 Paper submission  
 Submitted manuscripts are limited to 20 pages of technical content, excluding the bibliography. Every accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors at the conference.   
 ECRTS papers follow the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics paper template. You can download the  LIPIcs template and see the typesetting instructions here.    
 To submit a paper to ECRTS, please carefully review and follow the  submission instructions and guidelines   .   
 Double-blind peer reviewing   
 In the interest of maximizing fairness and the meritocratic nature of the evaluation process, ECRTS will follow a double-blind peer reviewing process. Authors will submit blinded manuscripts (that do not reveal author identity or affiliation), and reviewers will not be made aware of author identities.   
 See the  double-blind submission policy   for more details.   
 Shadow peer review process  
 For the first time this year, ECRTS will offer the authors a Shadow Technical Program Committee (TPC) option. The Shadow TPC is designed to train future reviewers by providing them with hands-on experience in the paper review process. Authors who choose to participate (on an opt-in basis) will have their submissions reviewed by both the regular TPC and the Shadow TPC, although the reviews from the Shadow TPC will not impact the final decision on the paper.   
 Artifact evaluation   
 To improve the results’ reproducibility and encourage reuse, authors of accepted papers with a computational component will be invited to submit their code and/or their data to an optional  artifact evaluation   process.

  The term “human agent” combines concepts such as artificial societies, virtual crowds and synthetic populations. These concepts are used in various fields, such as smart city planning, emergency management and national security. Agent-based simulation models involving human agents can capture the decision-making processes of individuals as they interact with and respond to other individuals and their environment. They are also used for various research tasks, such as policy decision support, what-if scenarios, predictive modeling, and guiding data collection.  
 Of particular interest are artificial societies in which the behavior of individual agents is guided by findings from computational social sciences and calibrated using data from the real world. These heterogeneous, often cooperative agents participate in social networks, which can be physical (e.g. workplaces, schools, sporting events) or virtual (e.g. chat groups with shared interests). Human agents are generally mobile in an environment where they are exposed to social factors and physical constraints. Since multi-agent systems are based on the distributed AI paradigm, autonomy and learning, e.g. in the form of reinforcement learning, are essential components of the system.  
 Despite the many applications and resulting publications, there remain basic methodological challenges in modeling realistic human behavior. These challenges include agent representation, construction of behavioral rules, incorporation of behavioral theories and their assumptions, validation and calibration of models representing complex social phenomena, and the detection and management of emergent behavior at the societal level.  
 Therefore, authors are encouraged to submit papers related to, but not limited to, the following areas:  
 Design and implementation of human agents and artificial societies (e.g., case studies, analyses of moral and ethical considerations). 
  LLM (Large Language Model)-based agents. 
  Learning / intelligent agents. 
  The role of the non-stationary environment for the simulation result. 
  Applications of human agents and cooperative artificial societies (e.g. modeling of group decisions and collective behavior, emergence of social structures and norms, dynamics of social networks). 
  Data collection for artificial societies (e.g., using simulations to identify data gaps, population simulations with multiple data sources, use of the Internet of Things). 
  Participatory modeling and simulation 
  Policy development and evaluation through simulations 
  Improved models of social behavior 
  Simulations of societies as public educational tools 
  Mixed-methods (e.g., analyzing or generating text data with artificial societies, combining machine learning and artificial societies) 
  Models of individual decision-making, mobility patterns, or socio-environmental interactions 
  Testbeds and environments to facilitate artificial society development 
  Addressing longstanding challenges (model validation, re-use, communication)

 The past two decades have brought about a dramatic increase in the deployment of simulation-based techniques in medicine, healthcare, and human performance models. Simulation scenarios are used extensively for training of medical personnel, students, first responders, and emergency response coordinators. Rapid advances in computer technologies, biomedical engineering, and systems engineering drive the development of cyber-physical systems that serve as simulation-based training platforms. Discrete-event and agent-based models are applied to representing population-based scenarios ranging from clinics to geographical epidemiology scenarios and asking what-if questions for improved outcomes. Physiological processes are modeled and discretized through coupled equations, both in isolation and in integrative physiology contexts. Increasingly, there is also an interest in modeling these processes at several scales, spanning the molecular, to cellular, to tissue and organ-wide scales. However, it is clear that methodological and theoretical foundations need to be strengthened to provide integrated, connected, and cross-cutting solutions for modeling and simulation in medicine, healthcare and human performance optimization. Thus, this meeting will attempt to “connect” researchers, developers, and medical practitioners to define unifying themes conducive to such solutions.  
 The conference will focus on (but is not limited to) the following topical areas:  
 Modeling and simulation in medicine: fundamental research. 
  Training and education. 
  Care delivery, outcomes, and patient’s safety. 
  Robotics and its applications in training and “in vivo”. 
  Life-critical systems. 
  Systems integration: “connected health”. 
  Cybersecurity and healthcare. 
  Human performance and ergonomics models. 
  Discrete-event and agent-based approaches to healthcare. 
  Physiological modeling, from single-system to integrative approaches. 
  Multi-scale modeling and simulation in medicine.

 Simulation-Based Learning (SBL): SBL refers to the use of simulation models and tools to enrich teaching and learning. SBL offers a wide range of opportunities for experiential learning and to practice critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. Research shows that SBL is among the most effective ways to learn complex skills across different domains as it enables knowledge application in a virtual yet realistic environment. Moreover, SBL educational experiences can be made available to geographically dispersed students in support of remote and online learning. All learning situations are of interest (formal/informal, in-person/distance learning, K-12, Higher Education, Professional Training, Continuing Education, etc.)  
 We encourage contributions that explore emerging trends in both Simulation Education and SBL, highlighting the potential of these tools to reshape education in the years ahead. Submissions from educators, academic researchers, industry professionals, instructional designers, educational technologists, and interdisciplinary teams are welcome, as we seek to uncover the full potential of simulation in transforming educational practices.

  The Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference (ANNSIM) offers conference attendees a stimulating and informative selection of tutorials reflecting current topics in the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) domain. Therefore, we invite experts in the M&S domain to present engaging tutorials at the ANNSIM 2025 conference. Tutorials provide researchers and practitioners with the opportunity to introduce their applications, tools, methodologies, or theories in 90-120 minute sessions.  
 Tutorials can be introductory, oriented toward participants who are interested in broadening their knowledge, or advanced, for participants who seek the latest advances in M&S. We encourage M&S researchers and practitioners in academia, government agencies, or industry to submit proposals for tutorials. Topics of interest include M&S theories, methodologies, and tools applied to any domain.  
 While both tutorials and workshops are designed to educate participants, they differ in their format and focus. A tutorial typically focuses on teaching specific skills, tools, or methodologies through structured presentations and demonstrations. It is more lecture-based, with the primary goal being to provide practical knowledge or insights to the attendees. In contrast, a workshop is more interactive and collaborative, often involving group discussions, hands-on activities, or problem-solving sessions. Workshops aim to engage participants more directly and may include the submission of papers or other contributions.  
 Proposals should be one to two pages and must include the following information:  
 Title of the workshop/tutorial and description (max 2 pages) 
  Organizers and their affiliations (including short bios) 
  Expected duration of the workshop/tutorial: 90 minutes, 120 minutes, a half-day, or full day. 
  If the proposal type is:   
 Workshop: Provide a sample call for papers, including workshop main topics. 
  Tutorial: Provide an abstract of the tutorial (up to 2 pages). A tutorial may submit a full paper to one of the related technical tracks, and if accepted after peer-review, it will appear in the conference proceedings. 
  Tutorial/workshop proposals should be submitted to the tutorial/workshop section in the conference system.

 ANNSIM’25 Call For Papers   
   
 The 2025 Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference (ANNSIM’25) is the annual conference sponsored by The Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS), which covers state-of-the-art developments in Modeling & Simulation (M&S). The conference includes keynote speeches presented by technology and industry leaders, technical sessions, and tutorials for professional development. Scientists, engineers, managers, educators, and business professionals who develop or use M&S methodologies and tools are invited to participate and present original contributions.  
 ANNSIM’25 invites original contributions to the theory, methodology, and practice of modeling and simulation in any scientific or engineering discipline. Original, high-quality technical papers are solicited for peer review, presentation, and subsequent publication in the conference proceedings if accepted. Technical papers are max 12 pages long with single column format. Tutorials and Ph.D. Colloquium submissions are 2 pages long. Papers must not have appeared before (or be pending) in a journal or conference with published proceedings, nor may they be under review or submitted to another forum during the ANNSIM’25 review process.  
 Authors of accepted papers are expected to register by the time of camera-ready submission, attend the conference, and present their work to their peers. Accepted technical papers will be submitted to the appropriate Digital Libraries for archiving and will be indexed in Scopus/DBLP and ACM databases.  
 Evaluation criteria: Double-blind submissions will be assessed with respect to their overall contributions, strengths and weaknesses. Feedback will include qualitative comments on these three dimensions as well as quantitative scores. Both qualitative and quantitative feedback will be used by track chairs to suggest a decision, which will then be reviewed by the organizing committee.

 Below you will find PDF forms including general guidelines for preparing and submitting your paper, the required transfer of copyright and author certification form, tips for writing a quality paper, as well as tips for giving a high-quality presentation (all presenters are encouraged to read this). We encourage all submissions to use LaTeX, and we have provided an Overleaf template to simplify the process of starting your paper. Authors are also able to use Word. Please note that these paper templates have changed significantly from previous versions. Please do not use a template from a previous year, as this will cause your manuscript to not be submitted.  
 LaTeX and Word Template and Guidance 
  Overleaf LaTeX template (preferred) 
  Upon Acceptance: | Author’s Kit Forms-Transfer of Copyright and Author Certification 
  At the Conference: | Guidelines for Writing a Good Paper | for the Proceedings of the Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS) 
  At the Conference: | How to Give a Great Presentation 

 General Process to Prepare and Submit a Paper      
   
 Once you decide on a paper template, the general process for preparing and submitting a conference paper is as follows:   
 Decide on a format (LaTeX is recommended but Word and Overleaf is allowed). The overleaf template is a quick way to start. 
  Modify those files to produce your submission. Remember to stay within the page limit and to remove all identifying information, as submissions are double-blind. 
  If your paper is accepted, you will have to submit to the paper submission site the final material: final version of paper (ZIP file), completed & signed Transfer of Copyright form, completed & signed Author Certification form, and a copy of your registration receipt. At least one author must register in advance for each accepted paper and come present it at the conference. 
  Submission link for ANNSIM 2025: | https://softconf.com/sim/ANNSIM25 | to submit your paper. 
    
 Policy on the use of AI in research papers:  The use of Generative AI to help with writing some of the paper must be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an SCS publication. Generative AI includes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT. If this use is specific to certain sections of the paper, we encourage authors to identify such sections (e.g., “We used GPT 4 to draft section 3.2”). The policy applies to conferences such as the Annual Modelling & Simulation Conference (ANNSIM), or extended versions submitted to the Society’s journals (Simulation: Transactions of the SCS, The Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation).  

 Since 1952, SCS has been a multidisciplinary society made up of working scientists, researchers, designers, and managers that are focused on promoting the use of computer simulation. Each year, our organization holds multiple events where M&S professionals from around the world come together to advance their career development, share ideas, benchmark processes, and network with each other.  
 SCS hosts or sponsors a number of conferences each year where participants may do the following:  
  • Present Papers  
  • Attend Technical Sessions  
  • Visit Exhibit Areas  
  • Interface with Vendors  
  • Network with Other M&S Professionals  

 What We Do  
 At any of the SCS-sponsored conferences, you may present a paper or attend technical sessions. Either way, you benefit from the professional exchange of information and camaraderie created by the social environment. The conference locations are picked with the family in mind so that they can enjoy the surroundings while you participate in the event.  
 SCS also publishes the proceedings of each conference for distribution to attendees and resale to other M&S professionals. A listing of all our international publications, provided to members free of charge, can be obtained from our office.

  37th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS’25)  
 July 8–11, 2025 | Brussels, Belgium | ecrts.org  
  Submission deadline: February 28, 2024 (23:59 AoE)  
  Submission website: tba  
  
   ECRTS is the premier European venue in the area of real-time systems and, alongside RTSS and RTAS, ranks as one of the top three international conferences on this topic. ECRTS has a rich history, with the first edition held in 1989 and this year’s edition being the 37th run of this annual event. As in previous editions, ECRTS attracts researchers from both academia and industry whose work tackles foundational and practical challenges at the intersection of real-time scheduling, time-critical systems, real-time operating systems, hardware/software co-design, security in time-sensitive systems, real-time networking, AI and machine learning methods for real-time systems, and more.   
 ECRTS 2025 will be held as a physical conference on July 8-11, 2025 in Brussels, Belgium.    
 Scope and topics of interest  
 Papers on all aspects of timing requirements in computer systems are welcome. Systems of interest include not only hard real-time systems but also time-sensitive systems in general (e.g., systems with soft requirements expressed in terms of tail latency, latency SLAs, QoS expectations, etc.). Typical applications are found not only in classical embedded and cyber-physical systems, but also increasingly in cloud or edge computing contexts and often stem from domains such as automotive, avionics, telecommunications, healthcare, robotics, and space systems, among others.   
 To be in scope, papers must address some form of timing requirement, broadly construed.  Prospective first-time authors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with works accepted in past editions of the conference, which are publicly available at drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS    
 ECRTS welcomes theoretical and practical contributions (including tools, benchmarks, and case studies) to the state of the art in the design, implementation, verification, and validation of time-sensitive systems. We particularly encourage papers on industrial case studies (such as the examples at  ecrts.org/industrial-challenge   ) and the application of real-time technology to real systems. We welcome practical contributions even without novel theoretical insights or formal proofs, provided they are of interest to the research community and/or industry. Whenever relevant, we encourage authors to present experimental results (preferably based on real data, but synthetic test cases are acceptable when adequately motivated).   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:   
 all elements of time-sensitive | SOFTWARE SYSTEMS | , including operating systems, hypervisors, middlewares and frameworks, programming languages and compilers, runtime environments, networks and communication protocols, etc.; 
  COMPUTER HARDWARE | design and hardware/software integration for embedded systems, including time-predictable hardware architecture, GPU and accelerators, FPGA prototyping, SoC design, novel memory architectures, hardware/software co-design, etc.; 
  REAL-TIME NETWORKS | : including wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN), industrial IoT, Software Defined Network (SDN), 5G, end-to-end latency analysis, etc.; 
  REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS | , including modeling, design, simulation, testing, debugging, and evaluation in domains such as automotive, avionics, control systems, industrial automation, robotics, space, railways telecommunications, multimedia, etc.; 
  foundational | SCHEDULING | and | PREDICTABILITY | questions, including schedulability analysis, algorithm design, synchronization protocols, computational complexity, temporal isolation, probabilistic guarantees, multi-core scheduling, resource co-scheduling, etc.; 
  static and dynamic techniques for | RESOURCE DEMAND ESTIMATION | , including stochastic and classic worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis, analyses to bound memory and bandwidth needs, and methods for determining the energy, power, or thermal footprint of real-time applications, etc.; 
  MACHINE LEARNING | techniques in safety-critical systems, including explainable AI, the application of machine learning to the design and optimization of real-time systems, methods for real-time AI computing, etc.; 
  FORMAL METHODS | for the verification and validation of real-time systems, including model checking, computer-assisted proofs, and runtime monitoring systems, etc.; 
  SECURITY | aspects of real-time systems, including techniques to strengthen security guarantees, concerns that affect the operation of safety-critical systems, privacy-enhancing techniques, methodologies to protect the temporal envelope of critical software against malicious threats, etc.; 
  the interplay of timing predictability and other | NON-FUNCTIONAL QUALITIES | such as reliability, quality of control, energy/power consumption, environmental impact, testability, scalability, etc. 
  The above list of topics is intended only as a coarse summary of recent proceedings and should  not   be understood as an exclusive list of interests. On the contrary,  papers breaking new ground, departing from established subfields, or challenging the status quo are most welcome and highly encouraged.   
  Open access  
 The ECRTS organizers and community strongly believe that a conference best serves the research community and the public when results are accessible to the largest audience without restrictions. In line with this belief, all accepted papers will be published again this year as open-access proceedings in collaboration with LIPIcs (Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics). Once published, the proceedings of ECRTS 2025 will be publicly accessible at  drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS   where the previous proceedings since 2017 are available.   
 Paper submission  
 Submitted manuscripts are limited to 20 pages of technical content, excluding the bibliography. Every accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors at the conference.   
 ECRTS papers follow the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics paper template. You can download the  LIPIcs template and see the typesetting instructions here.    
 To submit a paper to ECRTS, please carefully review and follow the  submission instructions and guidelines   .   
 Double-blind peer reviewing   
 In the interest of maximizing fairness and the meritocratic nature of the evaluation process, ECRTS will follow a double-blind peer reviewing process. Authors will submit blinded manuscripts (that do not reveal author identity or affiliation), and reviewers will not be made aware of author identities.   
 See the  double-blind submission policy   for more details.   
 Shadow peer review process  
 For the first time this year, ECRTS will offer the authors a Shadow Technical Program Committee (TPC) option. The Shadow TPC is designed to train future reviewers by providing them with hands-on experience in the paper review process. Authors who choose to participate (on an opt-in basis) will have their submissions reviewed by both the regular TPC and the Shadow TPC, although the reviews from the Shadow TPC will not impact the final decision on the paper.   
 Artifact evaluation   
 To improve the results’ reproducibility and encourage reuse, authors of accepted papers with a computational component will be invited to submit their code and/or their data to an optional  artifact evaluation   process.

 The 19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2025) will be held from September 15 to 19, 2025. ECSA 2025 is planned as an in-person conference taking place in the beautiful city of Limassol (Cyprus).   
  
  Scope    
 The theme for ECSA 2025 is “impactful software architecture”. The software architecture discipline has had a critical role in shaping robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. We are interested in learning about software architecture principles and practices, emergence trends and case studies highlighting strategic architectural choices that can lead to enhanced performance, improved collaboration, and long-term sustainability. The overarching question is how these architectural principles and practices, both well-established and emerging, are making an impact in real-world systems, and how that impact is being felt across various domains, from enterprise systems to more novel areas like, e.g., AI-driven or autonomous applications?   
 The Program Committee of 19th European Conference on Software Architecture seeks submissions of original and unpublished high-quality papers describing fundamental and applied research; new methods, approaches, and processes; novel applications; education and training in software architecture; and experience reports on all topics related to software architecture.   
 We particularly encourage papers that demonstrate that diversity in gender, culture, religion, country, etc. are key factors for success and innovation in software architecture.   
   Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:   
 Foundational principles of software architecture 
  Relationship of requirements engineering and software architecture 
  Quality attributes and software architectures 
  Architecture practices for secure, explainable, and trustworthy software 
  Architecture design and analysis 
  Architecture description languages and meta-models 
  Architecture verification and validation 
  Management of architectural knowledge, decisions, and rationale 
  Architecture patterns, styles, and tactics; reference architectures 
  Architecture viewpoints and views 
  Architecture conformance 
  Software architecture virtualization and visualization 
  Architecture-centric process models and frameworks 
  Software architecture and agile, incremental, iterative, and continuous development 
  Component-based models and deployment; middleware 
  Software architecture and system architecture 
  Software tools and environments for architecture-centric software engineering 
  Ethics, cultural, economic, business, social, human, and managerial aspects of software architecture 
  Architecture and technical debt 
  Architecting for sustainable and environment friendly systems 
  Applying AI and LLMs in software architecture and architecting for AI and LLM intensive systems. 
  Software architecture education 
  Cross-disciplinary approaches to software architecture 
  Architectures for reconfigurable and self-adaptive systems 
  Architectural concerns of autonomic systems 
  Software architecture applied to new and emerging areas, such as the cloud/edge, big data, blockchain, cyber-physical systems, IoT, autonomous systems, systems-of-systems, energy-aware software, quantum computing, AI-enabled systems 
  Empirical studies, systematic literature reviews, and mapping studies in software architecture 
  Diversity, equity, and inclusion in activities related to software architecture 
   
  Paper Submissions    
 ECSA 2025 seeks four types of papers for the research track:   
 Research papers   (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) which describe novel contributions to software architecture research (submissions should cover work that has a sound scientific/technological basis and has been validated) 
  Education and training papers   (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) that address methodologies, experiences and best practices for teaching and training software architecture 
  Experience reports   (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) that cover innovative implementations, novel applications, insightful performance results and experience in applying software architecture research advances to practical situations and systems 
  Short papers   (max. 8 pages in LNCS style) that present novel and preliminary work-in-progress or challenges in a topic of software architecture research, education, and training. Submissions must have a sound basis, but not necessarily be validated in full. 
  All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind peer review process. Papers will be selected based on originality, quality, soundness, and relevance. All contributions must be original, not published, accepted, or submitted for publication elsewhere. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. Plagiarism checking will be conducted and any paper reporting more than a 20% match with published work will be desk-rejected.   
 To note is that research papers, education and training papers, and experience reports that are rejected in their categories may be re-evaluated as short papers only if the committee decides on rejection of the full paper on the basis that it presents preliminary work.   
 The research track of ECSA 2025 supports an Open Science policy. We encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data/artifacts to increase reproducibility. Note that sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. Upon submission to the research track, authors are required:   
 To make their artifacts available to the program committee (via a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
  To include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
  To indicate why they do not intend to make their data or study materials publicly available upon acceptance, if that is the case. 
  While sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, authors are required to include a Data Availability statement after the Conclusions section in a section named "Data Availability". This statement should explain whether or not data and/or artifacts are available or how they could be accessed (or not). Upon acceptance, papers with Open Science artifacts (e.g., data, tools, etc.) will be invited to upload their artifacts into the ECSA Zenodo community (https://zenodo.org/communities/ecsa) to make them accessible and visible to the ECSA community. Sharing artifacts via the ECSA Zenodo community is required for authors to be eligible for the best Open Artifact award.   
 All contributions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0. Page limits include figures and references.   
 Contributions need to be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair to the ECSA 2025 Research Track:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecsa2025    . Please select the “Research Track” in EasyChair for your submission and click "Continue".   
 The proceedings will be published by Springer as part of the LNCS series. We also plan to organize a Special Issue on the theme of ECSA 2025 and to invite authors of selected papers to submit an extended version of their research.

  19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA'2025)  
   
 From: Announce <announce@ucy.ac.cy> To: concurrency <concurrency@listserver.tue.nl> Date: Sun, 20 Oct 2024 14:10:25 +0000 Subject: [Concurrency] 19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2025): First Call for Paper Submission and Workshop Proposals *** First Call for Paper Submission and Workshop Proposals *** 19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2025) September 15-19, 2025, 5* St. Raphael Resort and Marina, Limassol, Cyprus https://conf.researchr.org/home/ecsa-2025  (*** Proceedings to be published by Springer in LNCS ***) The European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA) is the premier European software architecture conference, providing researchers, practitioners, and educators with a platform to present and discuss the most recent, innovative, and significant findings and experiences in the field of software architecture research and practice. The 19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2025) will be held from September 15 to 19, 2025. ECSA 2025 is planned as an in-person conference taking place in the beautiful city of Limassol (Cyprus). SCOPE The theme for ECSA 2025 is "impactful software architecture". The software architecture discipline has had a critical role in shaping robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. We are interested in learning about software architecture principles and practices, emergence trends and case studies highlighting strategic architectural choices that can lead to enhanced performance, improved collaboration, and long-term sustainability. The overarching question is how these architectural principles and practices, both well-established and emerging, are making an impact in real-world systems, and how that impact is being felt across various domains, from enterprise systems to more novel areas like, e.g., AI-driven or autonomous applications? The Program Committee of the 19th European Conference on Software Architecture seeks submissions of original and unpublished high-quality papers describing fundamental and applied research; new methods, approaches, and processes; novel applications; education and training in software architecture; and experience reports on all topics related to software architecture. We particularly encourage papers that demonstrate that diversity in gender, culture, religion country, etc. are key factors for success and innovation in software architecture. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: - Foundational principles of software architecture - Relationship of requirements engineering and software architecture - Quality attributes and software architectures - Architecture practices for secure, explainable, and trustworthy software - Architecture design and analysis - Architecture description languages and meta-models - Architecture verification and validation - Management of architectural knowledge, decisions, and rationale - Architecture patterns, styles, and tactics; reference architectures - Architecture viewpoints and views - Architecture conformance - Software architecture virtualization and visualization - Architecture-centric process models and frameworks - Software architecture and agile, incremental, iterative, and continuous development - Component-based models and deployment; middleware - Software architecture and system architecture - Software tools and environments for architecture-centric software engineering - Ethics, cultural, economic, business, social, human, and managerial aspects of software architecture - Architecture and technical debt - Architecting for sustainable and environment friendly systems - Applying AI and LLMs in software architecture and architecting for AI and LLM intensive systems - Software architecture education - Cross-disciplinary approaches to software architecture - Architectures for reconfigurable and self-adaptive systems - Architectural concerns of autonomic systems - Software architecture applied to new and emerging areas, such as the cloud/edge, big data blockchain, cyber-physical systems, IoT, autonomous systems, systems-of-systems, energy- aware software, quantum computing, AI-enabled systems - Empirical studies, systematic literature reviews, and mapping studies in software architecture - Diversity, equity, and inclusion in activities related to software architecture PAPER SUBMISSIONS ECSA 2025 seeks four types of papers for the research track: - Research papers (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) which describe novel contributions to software architecture research (submissions should cover work that has a sound scientific/technological basis and has been validated) - Education and training papers (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) that address methodologies experiences and best practices for teaching and training software architecture - Experience reports (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) that cover innovative implementations novel applications, insightful performance results and experience in applying software architecture research advances to practical situations and systems - Short papers (max. 8 pages in LNCS style) that present novel and preliminary work-in- progress or challenges in a topic of software architecture research, education, and training. Submissions must have a sound basis, but not necessarily be validated in full. All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind peer review process. Papers will be selected based on originality, quality, soundness, and relevance. All contributions must be original, not published, accepted, or submitted for publication elsewhere. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. Plagiarism checking will be conducted and any paper reporting more than a 20% match with published work will be desk-rejected. To note is that research papers, education and training papers, and experience reports that are rejected in their categories may be re-evaluated as short papers only if the committee decides on rejection of the full paper on the basis that it presents preliminary work. The research track of ECSA 2025 supports an Open Science policy. We encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data/artifacts to increase reproducibility. Note that sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. Upon submission to the research track, authors are required: - To make their artifacts available to the program committee (via a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or - To include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and - To indicate why they do not intend to make their data or study materials publicly available upon acceptance, if that is the case While sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, authors are required to include a Data Availability statement after the Conclusions section in a section named "Data Availability". This statement should explain whether or not data and/or artifacts are available or how they could be accessed (or not). Upon acceptance, papers with Open Science artifacts (e.g., data, tools, etc.) will be invited to upload their artifacts into the ECSA Zenodo community ( https://zenodo.org/communities/ecsa  ) to make them accessible and visible to the ECSA community. Sharing artifacts via the ECSA Zenodo community is required for authors to be eligible for the best Open Artifact award. All contributions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0.  Page limits include figures and references. Contributions need to be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair to the ECSA 2025 Research Track: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecsa2025.  Please select the "Research Track" in EasyChair for your submission and click "Continue". The proceedings will be published by Springer as part of the LNCS series. We also plan to organize a Journal Special Issue on the theme of ECSA 2025 and to invite authors of selected papers to submit an extended version of their research. WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops and tutorials held in conjunction with ECSA 2025. Workshops and tutorials will be held on September 15-16 2025 (right before the main conference on September 17-19, 2025).

 Events/Conferences »  ECSCW – The EUSSET Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work  

 “ECSCW – The EUSSET Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work”  is a series of conferences on computer-supported cooperative work organised in Europe. The conference is known to be the International venue on practice-centred computing and the design of cooperative and collaborative technologies. From 1989 to 2017 ECSCW took place bi-annually in different towns in Europe (see below). From 2018 and onwards, ECSCW merged with COOP  and become an annual conference held in late May/early June under the aegis of EUSSET – The European Society for Socially-Embedded Technologies. Until 2025 the conference was called “The European Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work”. In 2025 the conference was renamed to highlight its international nature.  
 To learn about the history of ECSCW, have a look at the introduction from the Conference Chair to the first ECSCW in 1989  .  
 As stated in the preface to the ECSCW 1991 proceedings, CSCW is committed to grounding technological development and systems design in an understanding of “ the specifics of practical, situated action  “. ECSCW remains committed to this program.  
 ECSCW has been instrumental in defining the agenda of CSCW research since the beginning, and it still is. It has been the key forum for identifying and exploring issues such as  
 the situated nature of action and interaction and its implications; 
  the role of ethnography in CSCW and in computing in general, 
  the role and nature of ‘awareness’ in cooperative work; 
  the role of paper-based and other material artifacts in cooperative work; 
  highly flexible collaboration infrastructures and tailorable systems. 
  The ECSCW conferences are single-track conferences in order to facilitate critical discussion across the disciplinary and national subdivisions of the field.  
 Currently, ECSCW considers three kinds of work being presented at the main technical tracks of the conference:  
 “Exploratory Papers” report on smaller, focused studies, works-in-progress, or design probes, based on provocative ideas that explore a topic in new and possibly multiple ways. These contributions are published in the EUSSET Digital Library, with a DOI. 
  “Conference Papers” refer to papers making a specific, explicit contribution on their own but not as deep or broad as the ones expected from journal contributions. These papers are published in the EUSSET Digital Library, with a DOI. 
  “Journal Papers” are full length contributions, with deep and elaborated conceptual or theoretical contributions. published as ECSCW contributions in the | CSCW Journal  . 
  For a detailed information on the journal publication process, see this page  .  
 See https://www.facebook.com/ECSCW/  for the conference series Facebook page.  
 To provide a feeling for the (potential) impact of the different kinds of papers, we have collected some download statistics over the last years – the statistics are downloads per year (excluding downloads by robots) in average over all the papers:  
 ECSCW exploratory papers: For ECSCW2019 we had an average of 136 downloads/paper/year in the first year, for ECSCW2018 we had an average of 168 downloads/paper/year over two years and for ECSCW2017 we had an average of 83 downloads/paper/year over three years.  
  Regarding citation counts one could find on Google Scholar an average of 1 citation for ECSCW2019 exploratory papers after one year (max: 6), and an average of 5 citations for ECSCW2018 exploratory papers after two years (max: 12).  
 ECSCW journal papers: For the preprints stored in the EUSSET DL we had an average of 64 downloads/paper/year for ECSCW2019 and an average of 61 downloads/paper/year over two years for ECSCW2018.  
 To set these numbers in context: In the ACM Digital Library you can find average downloads for C&T of about 90/paper/year, and for ACM CSCW and ACM GROUP of about 100/paper/year.  
 Call for proposals to host ECSCW  
 We wish to invite the community to prepare proposals to host ECSCW in future years at European locations.  
 Expected duties of the ECSCW general chair(s) include: overseeing the overall organisation of the event; putting in place local arrangements for the conference and pre-conference events (booking rooms, catering, registration desk, etc.); assembling an organising committee (in consultation with the EUSSET steering group); liaising with the chairs of specific submission venues and with the members of the organising committee; budgeting and monitoring the financial status of the conference; helping in promoting the conference in collaboration with the other committee members and with EUSSET.  
 Proposals to host the ECSCW conference should include:  
 Which year the proposal refers to 
  A brief description of the proposed host organization; 
  Committee plans: the general co-chair(s) must be specified and described through short biographical sketches. 
  Additional information on suggested scientific chairs is welcome, if available; 
  Description of the proposed venue: Describe the conference location and facilities, as well as availability of accommodation options, travel infrastructure, location attractions and potential social/leisure activities; 
  Any other relevant issues: for example, any proposed innovations, additional information on venue/location, link to other events/activities organised by the proposed hosts, etc. 
  … and be sent to the chairman of the EUSSET steering committee – see Contact Information  .

 Membership »  EUSSET Position Paper  

  There is a paradigm shift in the computing field towards an anchoring of technology design in human activity that has been slowly gathering momentum over the past quarter century, and is now beginning to move from the periphery of the computing field to a central role. The issues at stake here are substantive and have profound implications for the understanding of the computing field. Thus it is not simply the need to (occasionally) talk about issues of computers and society, nor simply the need to incorporate user interface design or human-computer interaction. Rather, what is involved is a radical re-thinking of the computing field, and a shift in emphasis from aspects of the hardware and software to aspects of the human, social and organizational contexts within which information and communication technologies are both being designed and used.  
 Many people have been involved in the attempt to shift the focus of computing – and informatics more generally – away from a purely technical approach concerned with hardware and software only, to one that considers the human activities of design and use of information systems as being of central concern.  
  The reasons for this shift in perspective is the fact that IT artifacts are pervading almost all aspects of our daily lives. The very nature of the new technologies themselves, such asubiquitous computing and developments around open source software, Web 2.0, mash-ups, collaborative environments, massive multi-player gaming systems, recommender systems, and the rapid dissemination and take-up of social software sites such as YouTube, Flickr, illustrate this argument. However, the need for a stronger focus on socially embedding technologies also pertains to more traditional application fields, such as for example health care, education, manufacturing, as these become increasingly more computer-supported. Research in these domains requires a dialogue with practise. Compared to the US, Europe has a stronger tradition in cooperative research linking IT industries, application partners, and research institutions.  
  Over the past 20 years, within Europe, there has developed a large base of expertise coming from a variety of disciplines that has developed an approach to information systems (conceived both in the large – in terms of corporate or community infrastructures, to the small – in terms of home appliances, consumer products, mobile personal devices) conception, design and use that is built on a large corpus of fieldwork in a variety of domains and with a variety of stakeholders. Such work is evident in a number of highly regarded research conferences, such as European CSCW (ECSCW) conference series, the Participative Design Conference (PDC), a variety of Human-Computer Interaction events, such as NordiCHI, British HCI or MobileHCI, Workplace Studies meetings, the Community & Technologies conference series, and various Information Systems Conferences. From these practise-based lines of thinking, Europe has a competitive advantage when leveraging towards a new approach to engaging with design and use of technologies. Additionally, its cultural diversity engenders sensitivity towards the complexities of human activity.  
 Our approach  
 focuses on understanding human activity, from a variety of perspectives, all of which seek to provide useful and pertinent observations on human action in the world. What is common amongst this work is a highlighting of the user perspective, examining how people accomplish their goals – with and through other people, and at times, other media. While technology may play an important role in these human activities, often the use of the technology is as an intrinsic mediating influence, rather than being the goal of the activity. The relevance of this approach to technology development is that it provides a distinct perspective that encompasses many of the key issues being faced by computing technology developers today – issues such as awareness, context, interaction, engagement, emotion  . All of these aspects concern the activities of human actors in a (variety of) setting(s).  
 A Look Into The Future  
 Despite the rhetoric concerning the Information Society, what is remarkable is how little human beings have changed their goals, aspirations and even activities over the past half-century. New technologies are appropriated to fit into these more enduring concerns, of working, learning, meeting friends, searching for meaning in our lives. We need a rich understanding of the human, social and cultural world in order to design technological artefacts and environments that people find useful, usable and engaging. It is our belief that there needs to be significant research work to provide more integrated conceptual frames for understanding human activity in the world, which can serve as an inspiration and motivation for developing design scenarios involving ‘ubiquitous technology’ that can in turn orient technological developments.  
  This document argues for the need for a re-structuring of the research agenda in the fields of information technology in Europe. There is extensive support by the European Union for research on supporting the development of a knowledge-based economy in Europe. Much of this support is channeled through EU Framework Programmes for the Knowledge Economy. Within these programmes, significant resources are put into developing the underlying technical infrastructure – in terms of telecommunications and computing. More limited funding, often in other programs, is given for smaller projects investigating the economic, social, cultural, and political impact of these developments. There is a large gap, however, between the two poles of this continuum, from purely technical development to ‘social impact’ studies, and it is in this in-between space that we wish to position our approach, which is one that engages with design and construction of media and technologies  , but does so from a perspective where an understanding of individual and social use patterns and activities is primary. In other words, our aim is to support and leverage of human and social capabilities through augmenting these capabilities with new artefacts, media and infrastructures. In fact, we believe that our approach is essential in order ot ensure that our visions are grounded in knowledge of user needs and an understanding of workplace, home, and leisure activities. This is a distinct vision from certain other research programmes and perspectives currently in-vogue in Europe, such as Ambient Intelligence, Presence, and Robotics research agendas.  
 While there is significant work in mobile technologies, one of the areas where Europe has a lead, much of the work within the ubiquitous computing paradigm could benefit from a stronger grounding in practical human activities. Living Labs are an interesting design approach which could allow investigating into experimental appropriation activities of different stakeholders. However, this approach needs to be further worked out. We need to explicitly address questions such as: how can we arrive at a more holistic view of human-systems interaction that begins to privilege the human, social and cultural aspects of computing; how can we respond to the inescapable ‘permanent tension’ between the need for global systems and the enduring or emerging local concerns and issues, how can we design in support of cultural diversity, social inclusion, as well as social and environmental sustainability; how can we design for new forms of engagement and participation?  
 In Europe, we have a strong philosophical, sociological and anthropological research tradition that should be able to make a significant contribution to the articulation of more realistic scenarios for life in the future than those derived purely from technological fetishism. We are beginning to see the emergence of an approach to technology that is informed by an understanding of our social and cultural world. This can be seen in our developing understanding of how work gets done, of how people live in the home, of the importance of human networks, of how knowledge is not viewed simply as a thing to be delivered, of what motivates people. We need to build on this understanding, rather than ignore it. Thus we argue for a new paradigm for research within the EU on issues of the knowledge society and its underpinning infrastructures and media, in a nutshell, an exploration of socially-embedded technologies for the new European society of the 21 st  Century.

 Call for papers   
 The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners, CSCW 2025 will explore topics across sociotechnical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, design, entertainment, and ethics, including social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, and technologies for co-located or remote collaboration, communication, education, work articulation, coordination, awareness, and information sharing.  
 Papers are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems; or introduce new approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems. Submissions exploring how computing technologies — including those linked to recent developments in AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR — relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, providing they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues  . Submissions by members of underrepresented groups are particularly welcome. Authors exploring historical and sociotechnical perspectives on CSCW systems are also encouraged to submit.  
 We invite contributions to CSCW across a variety of human-centered research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including:  
 Social and crowd computing. | Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds, or collaborative information behaviors. 
  CSCW and social computing system development. | Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that are explored and discussed within the context of building new social and collaborative systems and experiences. 
  Methodologies and tools. | Novel human-centered methods, or combinations of approaches and tools used in building collaborative systems or studying their use. 
  Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses. | Studies of technologically enabled social, cooperative, and collaborative practices within and beyond work settings illuminating their historical, social, and material specificity, and/or exploring their political or ethical dimensions. 
  Empirical investigations. | Findings, guidelines, and/or studies of social practices, communication, cooperation, collaboration, or use, as related to CSCW and social technologies. 
  Domain-specific social, cooperative, and collaborative applications. | Including applications to healthcare, transportation, design, manufacturing, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains. 
  Ethics and policy implications. | Analysis of the implications of sociotechnical systems in social, cooperative and collaborative practices, as well as the algorithms that shape them. 
  CSCW and social computing systems based on emerging technologies. | Including mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, computer-aided or robotically-supported work, and sensing systems. 
  Crossing boundaries. | Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across fields of research, disciplines, distances, languages, generations, and cultures to help better understand how CSCW and social systems might help transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries. 
  Send queries about paper submissions to papers2025@cscw.acm.org  .  
 To promote work-life balance, we have set all deadlines on Tuesdays to avoid weekends at any time zone.  
 SUBMISSION PROCESS   
 SUBMISSION MODEL   
 To support diverse and high-quality contributions, CSCW uses a two-cycle review process with the opportunity for major revisions reviewed by the same reviewers. Accepted papers are published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction  (PACM HCI) Journal.  
 CSCW 2025 will follow the half-yearly submission model implemented in CSCW 2022. Thus, new paper submissions will be only possible for the July 2024  and October 2024  deadlines. We have four additional deadlines in December, March, April, and July for revisions only. Failure to submit a revised version of a paper by the associated deadline means that the paper has been withdrawn.  
 Below is an overview of the submission timeline. All a  ccepted papers from these two cycles will be invited to present at CSCW 2025.

 PROCESS DETAILS   
 CSCW 2025 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com  . Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the SIGCHI Submission and Review Policy, including, but not limited to:  
 That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. 
  Occasionally, a paper may have some overlap with a prior publication (for example, there is some overlap with the datasets used, but the analyses in each paper are considered to be a completely different and substantial contribution). This | must | be disclosed to the editorial team at the time of submission. Authors must provide a detailed explanation of the overlap and distinct contribution of each paper in the “Comments (optional)” field on the submission form. Please make sure to refer and adhere to the ACM policy in reuse of content from prior publications available at: | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions 
  Similarly, for parallel submissions (authors submitting multiple papers related to the same study), authors also need to provide information about the relationship between submissions, as well as how they are different from one another in the “Comments (optional)” field of the submission form. Please make sure to refer and adhere to the ACM policy in simultaneous submissions available at: | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions 
  That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. 
  For information about re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to section 1.5.4 of the ACM SIGCHI policy.  
 Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the PACM HCI and the ACM Digital Library.  
 Authors should adhere to the new ACM policy in authorship, available at https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship  .  
 PAPER GUIDELINES REGARDING SCOPE   
 CSCW is a broad and interdisciplinary field, covering many methods, theories, and epistemologies. It is difficult to draw explicit disciplinary boundaries of what counts and what does not count as CSCW research. Nonetheless, in the spirit of welcoming those new and not as familiar to CSCW, we believe it is beneficial to offer some guidelines when deciding whether your submissions are appropriate for CSCW.  
 In general, contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation  and be  properly contextualized   in the CSCW literature  , with clear reference to CSCW concepts and/or theories informing, being affected or being proposed. Please note that papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to individual users will be considered out of scope. For example, this would include papers whose major contribution is on user research findings that inform the design of a system primarily focused on benefiting a sole, individual user. Also, systems-based or algorithmic research not making explicit how it involves aspects of cooperative, collaborative or social computing are not within the scope of CSCW.  
 Therefore, authors should clearly answer yes to the following:  
 Does your work build upon, bridge, discuss, or cite prior CSCW work in a significant manner? Does it make clear how it offers new knowledge of benefit to the CSCW community? 
  Have you clearly elaborated on how the results of your work are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions? 
  Authors must make sure that their submission is within the scope of the conference. During the submission, authors will be asked to write a short paragraph explaining how this is the case. Contributions out of scope will be desk rejected.   The scope statement should be fully anonymized to ensure the double-blind review process – see section on anonymous review policy below. Please ensure your statement does not contain any information that can identify any of the authors, their institutions, partners, or cities.  
 ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   
 Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names  and affiliations  removed, including references to universities, institutional review boards,   companies, labs, and cities  . Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Furthermore, obvious identifying statements and information that might confuse reviewers regarding the authors (e.g., mock authors’ names originally in templates provided to demonstrate formatting) should be removed. Images used in the paper must NOT disclose the authors identity or suggest affiliation. This policy includes all submitted materials, including supplemental materials and the scope statement. Papers that violate this policy will be desk rejected.    
 Please check in particular the first page, headers and footers, images, the acknowledgements section, AND meta-data of all   submitted file   s   .  For resubmissions, make sure that the authors’ identities are not disclosed in the annotated document submitted in addition to the clean version. If possible, check the document with tracked changes in different PDF readers. It is possible that some tracked-change information that is visible in a reader (e.g., Adobe Acrobat) is not visible in others (e.g., Preview).  
 Citations to authors’ own relevant work should NOT be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work…”  
 CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the peer review process, we ask that no authors publicize the work until the review process is complete  . Please do not share any confidential information specific to a current review process publicly or on social media, with the exception of doing public exhibitions, festivals, and performances as part of the research where the name is integral to the work.  
 When submitting your papers to PCS, please also ensure your scope statement follows the anonymous review policy.  
 We also ask reviewers to refrain from taking steps to learn about authors’ identity during the peer review process.  
 FORMATTING AND LENGTH   
 Word authors:  Because CSCW papers are published in PACM HCI, which uses the Sheridan service, authors need to use the old interim ACM Small template,  which is ONLY available at the following link:  
  https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates   
 LaTeX authors  need to use the template at  
  https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions  , and insert the acmsmall call.  
 Overleaf authors  need to use the template at  
  https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf  , and use the acmsmall call.  
 Papers that use a completely different template will be  desk rejected.    Small variance on font styles, which is possible when authors do not have particular fonts installed in their computers, will be tolerated for the initial submission but will have to be fixed in case the paper is accepted for publication.  
 Note:  In preparing revisions, authors should continue using the template they had used for their original submissions. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. If a paper is shorter than 5000 words or exceeds 12,000 words, it will be submitted to additional scrutiny. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be  rejected   .  Note that additional materials can be submitted as appendices but be aware that reviewers are not bound to decide based on these materials.  
 POLICY ON USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs) AND OTHER AI TOOLS   
 If AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were used in the writing of the paper beyond a simple grammar check, their use should be acknowledged and described in the text of the submitted version. ACM policy  states that authors must be the “creator or originator of an idea” and/or work, so relying on AI-tools to generate ideas in the manuscript is not allowed. Note that we will investigate submissions brought to our attention for undeclared use of LLMs or other AI-tools.  
 DECISIONS AND DEADLINES   
 CSCW will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 2-4 months from the initial submission (depending on the cycle). For the July 2024 submission deadline, we hope to send out all final notifications by Mar 26, 2025, i.e., after final acceptance of papers that receive a Major Revisions notification after initial submission. For the October 2024 submission deadline, all final notifications should be out by Aug 6, 2025, i.e., after final acceptance of papers that initially received a Major Revisions recommendation for that cycle.  
 Accept: | Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted for verification by the corresponding Associate Chair (1AC). The submission will appear in an upcoming issue of the PACM HCI. 
  Minor revision: | Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication. The revised submission MUST be submitted along with a brief response to the reviewers’ comments. The revision will be verified by the corresponding Associate Chair (1AC) and if approved, the submission will be promoted to an accepted paper. 
  Major revision: | Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, then re-reviewed. For July 2024 submissions receiving a Major Revision decision must be resubmitted by the December 2024 deadline. For October 2024 submissions, major revisions are due in April 2025. The authors must ensure that the paper has been revised sufficiently to warrant re-review. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same AC and reviewers for re-review. Upon re-review, submissions can receive one of two decisions: Accept with minor revisions or Reject. Unlike most journals, the current CSCW review process does NOT allow for more than one major revision recommendation due to reviewer availability and time constraints. 
  Reject: | Authors of rejected papers are allowed to resubmit their papers under special conditions. Please refer to the section | Resubmission of Rejected and Withdrawn Papers. 
  Desk / Quick Reject: | Authors should only submit completed work of | publishable quality | and | within the scope of ACM CSCW | . Editors will | desk reject | papers that do not comply with such requirements. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will also be | desk rejected | without review. Finally, the ACs, in cooperation with the Editors, may Quick Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. While we endeavor to notify authors early in the process, desk or quick rejects may happen at | any time | throughout the review process up until notifications. 
  RESUBMISSION OF REJECTED AND WITHDRAWN PAPERS   
 Papers in the following categories can be resubmitted at the next submission deadline:  
 Papers that have been desk or quick rejected 
  Papers that got Minor Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn) 
  Papers that gets rejected after resubmitting Major Revisions 
  On the other hand, papers that fall in one of the following categories must wait an extra deadline to be resubmitted:  
 Papers that get rejected in first review round 
  Papers that got Major Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn) 
  For example, if the paper was rejected after the initial submission in July 2024, authors cannot re-submit in the October 2024 cycle, but can resubmit the paper after    the October 2024 cycle.  
 Please notice that all resubmitted papers will be treated as a new submission, meaning they will most likely be assigned to a new Editor, new ACs, and new reviewers. Papers resubmitted with no or marginal changes (except resubmission of minor revisions papers that missed the resubmission deadline) will be desk rejected  without review.  
 Authors must describe the paper’s submission history and briefly outline the changes in a designated field in PCS when resubmitting. Failure to disclose the paper’s submission history may lead to a desk reject  decision. ACs and reviewers will have access to this description of the paper’s submission history and may also request to review the detailed submission history.  
 DECISION APPEAL PROCESS   
 We recognize that authors may sometimes feel a review is unfair, inappropriate, or problematic in other ways. CSCW has implemented the following process for authors who wish to appeal a decision:  
 Either: | Authors directly contact the Papers Chairs to officially appeal a decision 
  A committee member (1AC / 2AC / Editor / Papers Chair) raises an issue about the decision or decision-making process, possibly in response to a communication from an author 
  The appeal involves motivating the case with evidence 
  Papers Chairs assess the situation and make an initial call to bring it up for discussion with the Editors 
  The Editor assigned to the submission reviews the paper, the reviews, and the discussion in PCS to determine if the case is valid. The Editor may choose to involve the ACs at this stage 
  Other Editors weigh in and review the case 
  The Editors come to a collective decision and share their decision with the Papers Chairs 
  The Papers Chairs discuss the Editors’ decision. If a change is agreed, Papers Chairs record the updated decision in PCS 
  The Papers Chairs communicate the final decision to the authors. Decisions are final and further appeals will not be pursued. 
  Appeals must be submitted no later than seven days after the decision notification is out. Any appeal submitted after that time limit will not be pursued.   
 PRIMARY RESEARCH PARADIGM   
 When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be asked to indicate the primary research paradigm of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment. Currently there are six paradigm choices available:  
 Technical/Systems, e.g., building novel CSCW systems, algorithms, implementing novel features in existing systems, etc. 
  Empirical–Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, workplace studies, qualitative user studies, etc. 
  Empirical–Quantitative, e.g., “big data,” quantitative user studies, statistical methods, etc. 
  Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research, design explorations combined with technical feature development, etc. 
  Design, e.g., design implications, guidelines, methods, techniques, etc. 
  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning CSCW studies/domains, theoretical analysis, literature reviews, and essays, etc. 
  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE   
 Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. Authors are encouraged to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors are also encouraged to use open access repositories and make their data and other material FAIR when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to describe efforts to make their work more reproducible. Reviewers are encouraged to support evolving approaches to supporting open and transparent research practices.  
 VIDEO FIGURES   
 Authors may consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission (no more than three minutes long). Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.  
 PRESENTING AT THE CONFERENCE   
 Accepted papers are invited to present at the corresponding conference, and authors can choose whether or not they wish to present. If a situation arises and an author who is scheduled to present at the conference is no longer able to, they should immediately reach out to the Papers Chairs to discuss alternative options. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 Welcome to the Web site of the EDBT Association (edbt.org)   
 The Association  
 The EDBT Association is a non-political and non-profit organization for promoting and supporting research and progress in the fields of databases and information systems technology and applications. It was formed in 1990 to provide a stable structure to support the continuity of the EDBT Conference series; it changed its legal status in 1995, assuming the current legal form of an association according to Italian laws.  
 Our major activity is the promotion of the International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT), which has been held every two years since 1988. From 2008 on, the Conference is being held annually.  
 The EDBT Association has close relationships with other organizations in the database field, including ACM SIGMOD  , IEEE TC on Data Engineering  , VLDB Endowment  , and the ICDT Council  .  
   
 Conference Proceedings  
 In the beginning, the Conference Proceedings have been published by Springer-Verlag  as part of the LNCS  Series. We have also promoted a series of Summer Schools, started in 1991.  
 From 2008 to 2013, the Conference Proceedings have been published in the ACM Digital Library (part of the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series, AICPS); Open Access copies are located on this EDBT.org server in Germany.  
 In the year 2014, EDBT Proceedings moved to a new, fully Open Access publication platform they started in cooperation with the University of Konstanz Library: OpenProceedings.org  . From this publication site, copies of all papers can be freely (re-)distributed under a Creative Commons License.  
 All EDBT Proceedings are listed in the Computer Science Bibliography at dblp.org  .

 In Memoriam  
 2022  
 Joachim W. Schmidt  was a founding member of the EDBT Association and long term member of the Executive Board. He has always given valuable advice for further developping the format, the scientific quality, and the attractiveness of our Conferences and Summer Schools. For many of us, he has been a true friend. Joachim passed away in May 2022. We are missing him.  
 2019  
 Christine Collet  was a senior member of the EDBT community, a long term member of the Executive Board and past President of the EDBT Association. Christine carried out these roles with good humour and enthusiasm, while still making sure that things were done. Christine passed away in early 2019. We are missing her.

 New Publication Schedule of EDBT Conferences 2022 ff.    
 3 Submit/Review Cycles  
 Starting with the 2022 edition of the EDBT Conference, we switched to a model of multiple review cycles like many other major conferences in our field. In the future, there will be 3 cycles each year. For the 2022 transition period, only 2 of them could be implemented, also the working period of the 2022 PC was extended to also cover the first cycle of the 2023 conference. The 2023 PC will only handle the last two cycles of Volume 26. Accepted papers of early cycles will be published in early numbers of the Proceedings volume.  
 The following picture explains the future scheme for submission/review cycles and the publication of 3 numbers per volume of the EDBT Proceedings.  
    
 12 Month Resubmission Ban  
 EDBT, like other conferences in our field with multiple submit/review cycles, follows a "12 month resubmission ban" model for rejected and withdrawn papers in each of its track formats:  
 EDBT conferences typically have tracks with short and long paper formats. Resubmission of work is not allowed to any track of EDBT if the work - or any work with substantial overlap with the submitted paper and with the same or overlapping sets of authors - was previously rejected from a track of EDBT in the same paper format, within 12 months. A paper withdrawn by the authors after a revision decision will be considered as rejected and the 12-month resubmission ban applies to such papers as well.

 Test of Time Awards   
 In 2014, EDBT began to give a Test-of-time Award for the paper (or a small number of papers) that has had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, conceptual contribution, or transfer to practice since it appeared in the proceedings of EDBT.

 x   Statutes  
   
 STATUTES -- with changes as of 26 March 2006 included -- TITLE I - GENERAL DISPOSITIONS Article 1 An association is founded, which is denominated "ASSOCIATION EDBT". The association has its seat in ... [Text removed from original to preserve privacy. Webmaster edbt.org]. Article 2 The association is non-political and does not have any intended use of profit. It makes as its object to promote and favour in Europe the progress and study of the technology and applications concerning the databases. To this end the association will be able to: 1. contribute to the advanced vocational training by promoting training courses and advanced continuity studies of problems, innovations and/or developments in the databases; 2. favour the exchange of experiences, information and data between the specialists of the branch . no matter how they are linked to the databases; 3. promote and coordinate studies and research in the field of the databases either directly in co-operation with the associates or with similar European or international corporations and institutes; 4. spread the knowledge of modern technologies concerning the databases and known problems with their introduction and their application, also by granting scholarships to young researchers, students and scientists; 5. unfold other useful activities with attaining indicated purposes under the condition that they do not represent a commercial activity. Article 3 Always to reach the proper objective the association can promote the institution of a meeting having an international character that is called .International Convention Extending Data Base Technology.. But the association cannot charge itself with organising the convention, what must thus be carried out by natural persons or corporations, in comparison to whom/which the association will maintain the fullest independence. The association will instead occupy itself . also by means of the right own associates . with the obliged scientific aspects at the to-be-provided, to-be-required convention, also at the scientific directorate. Article 4 In order to carry out the appropriate purpose the association will take care of the initial assets made available by the founding members, and also of the voluntary contributions meanwhile effected by the other associates or other corporations interested in the activities of the association. Article 5 The organs of the association are: a) assembly of the associates; b) the Managing Board. TITLE II . THE ASSOCIATES Article 6 The natural persons of the association and the juridical persons, who due to their work activity or study are interested in the activities of the association itself, can participate. The admission to the association at the proposal of the Managing Board will be decided at the discretional procedure of the assembly of the associates. In particular those, who will have covered the positions of General Chairperson, Program Committee Chairperson, Organisation Committee Chairperson in the international convention EDBT, will be invited by the Managing Board to make available their experiences at the end of the meeting by becoming members of the association, if they should not yet have been such associates. Article 7 Associates can resign from the Association by written notice. The Managing Board can exclude associates upon repeated failure to attend the annual meeting or otherwise participate in the association's activities. Exclusion by such a decision needs to be brought to the associate's attention with appropriate notice in advance. Associates are responsible for keeping their contact information up-to-date. Associates who are not reachable due to failure of doing so are not counted on voting quotas and may be excluded from the association TITLE III . MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATES Article 8 The statutory/ordinary meeting of the associates convoked upon deliberate resolution of the Managing Board not less than twenty days before the date fixed for the session reconvenes in the locality to be indicated in the memorandum of convocation, at least once a year, to provide and to deliberate about the financial reporting, about the state of assets and all other arguments of general character entered to the order of the day by initiative of the Managing Board, otherwise upon request of at least five associates. The meeting will stipulate the criteria, to which the executive committee must adhere in promoting the scientific activity of the association and moreover the convention EDBT concerning art. 3. The date and agenda of the meeting are communicated to the associates by registered letter or whatever other means, which the Managing Board will deem to consider appropriate. Article 9 All associates are authorised to intervene in the meeting; each one of the associates will be able to represent one or more other associates provided he is furnished with regular instruction in writing. For the legal convocation of the meeting and for the validity of the resolutions the support operation of at least 50% of the registered associates is required. In lack of the legal number in the second convocation the meeting is valid with any number of associates being present or represented. The date of this session will be fixed in the same notification of convocation as of the first one. The Managing Board can admit the vote for concurrence on determined arguments to the order of the day and on the election of the corporate charges/positions. Two associates nominated by the chairman when opening the assembly will execute the recount of the cast ballots. Article 10 The meeting makes resolutions by a majority of votes of the associates present or represented by means of regular delegation in writing issued to the other associate. The vote for concurrence must arrive at least on the day before the meeting and will be contained in the count of the associates who are present at the end of the legal establishment of the meeting. Article 11 The assembly/meeting elects from the associates who are present a chairman and a secretary at the beginning of each session. The secretary provides to draw up the minutes of the resolutions of the assembly. The minutes must be signed by the chairman of the assembly, by the secretary and by the polling clerks, if here the voting is done. Article 12 Extraordinary and ordinary meetings can be convoked by deliberation of the Managing Board or upon demand of such associates who do represent not less than the tenth part of the inscribed ones. Article 13 The members assembled in the meeting can modify the present statute, but cannot modify the purposes of the association as fixed by the preceding articles 2 and 3. For the validity of the resolutions, as of the preceding passage . no matter whether in the first or second convocation . the presence of at least half of the associates and favourable vote of three fifths of the present, cast or represented votes is required. TITLE IV . THE MANAGING BOARD Article 14 The Managing Board is nominated by the meeting and is composed of not less than three members, the number of the members of the Managing Board will be determined by the assembly itself. For the first time the determination of the number of the members and their assignment will be effected in the constituting act. The Managing Board endures in office for four years. In case of dismissal of councillors before expiry of the mandate the Managing Board will provide for their substitution by co-option. The councillors so nominated remain in office until the successive orderly meeting. If for some reason the number of councillors is reduced to less than two thirds, the whole Managing Board must be renewed. The office of councillor is gratuitous. Article 15 The Managing Board is endowed with every power to decide on initiatives to be assumed and the criteria to be followed for the pursuit and attention of the purposes of the association and for its management and ordinary and extraordinary administration. In particular the board: a) fixes the directives for the execution of the statutory tasks, hence stabilises the terms and responsibilities of execution and verifies the execution itself; b) decides concerning the questions of assets; c) can stabilise the founding of the technical committees and commissions for the studying of various problems that are pertinent to the purposes of the association; d) decides on the activities and initiatives of the association and its collaboration with third persons at the norm of art. 2 and determines the amount of eventual contributions on deficit account to the organisers of the EDBT convention; e) approves the projects of the budget, financial plan and status of assets to be presented to the meeting of the associates. Article 16 The Managing Board nominates from among their members a chairman who stays in office for the whole period of the council. This meeting takes place whenever this is necessary, by initiative of the chairman or at least a quarter of the board members. Article 17 The resolutions of the Managing Board are taken by the majority of votes of the councillors who are present. In case of a parity of votes that of the chairman has prevalence. The decisions of the meeting are valid, if at least half of the councillors take part at the meeting. Article 18 The signature and legal representation of the association as against any judicial and administrative authority and as against third persons are conferred to the chairman of the Managing Board. By statute all powers necessary for the bank activities and financial activities of the association - as there exist at exemplified and not exhaustive title . are attributed to the chairman, the opening and closing of current bank accounts, stock deposit, the faculty of operating also through cheques on same accounts, effecting payments and drawings within the limits of the conceded entrusted documents, collection of sums of any title, issuance of receipts and actuating in general all that would be necessary for the economic and financial management of the association, nothing excluded nor excepted. The chairperson of the Managing Board can delegate parts of his or her responsibility to another member of the Managing Board. Article 18 a) Whenever these Statutes require "written" notice, e.g., for votes or other communication, reliable electronic communication (such as, for example, signed e-mail or secured, authenticated Web-site interaction) is explicitly included. TITLE V . FINAL PROVISIONS Article 19 All charges are gratuitous. Article 20 The duration of the association is an unlimited period of time. Article 21 In case of dissolution of the association after deduction of the charges for managing the association and the liabilities the residual assets will be appropriated in favour of cultural initiatives and research indicated by the Managing Board Article 22 The association can at any time request the acknowledgment only, if all lawful obligations are observed. Article 23 For all that has not been provided expressly, reference is made to the dispositions of the substantive law.

 x   Test of Time Award 2014  
   
 Starting in 2014, EDBT gives a Test-of-time Award for the paper (or a small number of papers) that has had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, conceptual contribution, or transfer to practice since it appeared in the proceedings of EDBT.  
 The EDBT ToT award for 2014 will be presented during the EDBT/ICDT 2014 Joint Conference, March 24-27, 2014 in Athens, Greece ( http://www.edbticdt2014.gr/  ).  
 The EDBT 2014 Test of Time Award committee was formed by Gustavo Alonso, Torsten Grust and Walid Aref, all members of the EDBT 2014 PC and chaired by Sihem Amer-Yahia, the EDBT 2014 PC chair. The committee was charged with selecting a paper or a small number of papers from the EDBT 2004 proceedings that has had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, conceptual contribution, or transfer to practice over the past decade. After careful consideration, the committee has decided to select the following paper as the EDBT ToT Award winner for 2014:  
 Charu C. Aggarwal, Philip S. Yu   
  A Condensation Approach to Privacy Preserving Data Mining   
  EDBT 2004, pp. 183-199 ( electronic edition  )   
 The paper addresses the topic of privacy-preserving data mining and proposes a framework for anonymization in contrast to perturbation approaches that introduce noise. The approach advocated in this paper takes into consideration the correlated nature of multi-dimensional data and also that is not problem-specific, i.e., the framework is generic and many mining operations can be formulated and solved given the same framework.  
 The paper is seminal and covers a topic which has not lost relevance today. It constitutes a prime example of how far a simple idea (in this case condensation: reduce a group of records to a number of carefully selected statistical properties of that group) can carry a whole line of original research. Condensation comes with a naturally built-in "privacy dial" (namely the group size) and is practical (easily implemented, maintainable under updates). It established general techniques that have been taken up by many people in the area and outside the area. The results in this paper can be (and have been) generalized in many ways as they tackled a more general problem of grouping, aggregation, and sampling.  
 According to Google Scholar, the paper has been constantly cited in the period from 2005 until today (2013) with a remarkable peak in 2008 when privacy-preserving data mining and database security in general became research topics of core interest.

  Geo-Relational Algebra: A Model and Query Language for Geometric Database Systems   
  EDBT 1988, pp. 506-527 ( electronic edition  )   
 The paper addresses the user’s conceptual model of a database system for geometric data. It proposes to extend relational database management systems by integrating geometry at all levels: At the conceptual level, relational algebra is extended to include geometric data types and operators. At the implementation level, the wealth of algorithms and data structures for geometric problems developed in the past decade in the field of Computational Geometry is exploited. The paper starts from a view of relational algebra as a many-sorted algebra which allows to easily embed geometric data types and operators. A concrete algebra for two-dimensional applications is developed. It can be used as a highly expressive retrieval and data manipulation language for geometric as well as standard data. Also, geo-relational database systems and their implementation strategy are discussed.  
 The committee members unanimously agreed that this paper clearly stands out in terms of relevance, impact, and influence in databases. Of all the papers considered, this is the one that had had the most and longest lasting impact with results that are still relevant today and whose influence can be traced to many real systems and a significant amount of follow up work.  
 The paper pioneered an important application area well before it became mainstream and did it in a systematic and clean way that has been very influential in both research and practice. Modern commercial systems all support geographic data types that are nowadays used in a wide range of applications and use cases (maps locations based services, geographic information systems, mobility etc.).  
 The selection committee also appreciated very much the cleanliness completeness, insights, formalism, and systematic treatment of the problem as well as the approach followed by the author in selecting and solving a research problem.

  Bridging Physical and Virtual Worlds: Complex Event Processing for RFID Data Streams   
  EDBT 2006, pp. 588-607 ( electronic edition  )   
 The paper proposes an event-oriented approach to the processing of RFID data which makes it possible to automate the translation of RFID based application semantics through complex event detection. In particular, it demonstrates the ability to process complex events by capturing temporal constraints in an algebra. The resulting declarative event-based approach is shown to simplify RFID data processing and is shown to be scalable. The paper pioneers declarative event-based RFID processing. The simplicity and expressiveness of the proposed framework are admirable. For example, the framework makes it possible to express object tracking on historical data as well as to formulate real-time monitoring.  
 The committee and the EDBT executive board find that this paper stands out in terms of relevance, impact, and influence in databases. It has had substantial impact. In particular, it has impacted real systems, and the engine it proposes has been integrated into Siemens RFID Middleware. It is also the most cited EDBT 2006 paper, has spurred a significant amount of follow-up work, and remains relevant today.

  Mining Sequential Patterns: Generalizations and Performance Improvements   
  EDBT 1996, pp. 3-17 ( electronic edition  )   
  
 This paper has made substantial contributions to data mining, and has had great influence on the work of others, as reflected by over 2900 citations on Google Scholar.  
 The paper formalizes a new variant of the problem of mining sequential  patterns and develops and implements GSP, an algorithm to solve this problem. This paper extends the definition of sequence mining that was introduced by the same authors in a previous publication: Mining Sequential Patterns. ICDE 1995. The goal is to discover all sequential patterns with a user-specified minimum support from a database of sequences, where each sequence is a list of transactions ordered by transaction-time, and each transaction is a set of items. The proposed extensions are:  
 Time constraints: the authors generalised their previous definition of sequential patterns to admit max-gap and min-gap time constraints between adjacent elements of a sequential pattern. 
  Sliding windows: the authors relaxed the restriction that all the items in an element of a sequential pattern must come from the same transaction, and allowed a user-specified window-size within which the items can be present. 
  Taxonomies: the sequential patterns may include items across different levels of a taxonomy. 
  GSP guarantees that all rules that have a user-specified minimum support. It is shown to be much faster than the AprioriAll algorithm in the previous publication (on both synthetic and real data). GSP has been implemented as part of the Quest data mining prototype at IBM Research, and is incorporated in the IBM data mining product.

  Social ties and their relevance to churn in mobile telecom networks   
  EDBT 2008, pp. 668-677 ( electronic edition  )   
  
 This industry track paper reports on an analysis of mobile telecoms data, with a view to predicting which customers will leave. The analysis involves commercial mobile telephony data, in which nodes are customers and edges represent calls. The hypothesis tested is that it is possible to predict who will leave a network based on earlier departures among their connections. The main technique investigated is the use of spreading activation, to predict the heat of nodes based on the heat of connected notes. It is shown how the approach based on connections is more effective than classification techniques based on other properties of the nodes. As a result, the paper provides early and compelling experience on the combination an important real problem (churn in mobile telecom networks) with a powerful technique (social ties) and applies it on large real data (telecom operator network over 4 months). The approach has influenced many subsequent studies, for the same problem, but also for analyses involving different types of network and different hypotheses. Social network analysis continues as an important and active area ten years later, and this paper continues to be widely cited.

  Shore-MT: a scalable storage manager for the multicore era   
  EDBT 2009, pp. 24–35 ( electronic edition  )   
  
 The committee members agreed that this paper clearly stands out in terms of methodology, impact, and influ- ence. It has catalyzed and enabled substantial follow-up research and has demonstrated its high relevance to industry.  
 Abstract:   
  Historically, database engines focused on the ability to efficiently overlap many requests over a small number processor cores, with I/O latencies and scalability as the main design driver. However, the advent of increas- ingly multicore hardware circa 2000 brought new challenges because concurrent transactions begin to stress the limits of the storage manager’s thread scalability by accessing its internal structures simultaneously and in large numbers. This EDBT 2009 paper shows the results of experiments running benchmarks on four (then and still) popular open-source storage managers (Shore, BerkeleyDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL) on a multi- core machine. The results show that all systems suffer from scalability bottlenecks at the storage engine level. From that research emerged Shore-MT, an open-source multithreaded and highly scalable storage manager, built with Shore as a base. We learned that designers should favor scalability over single-thread performance, and we identified several other key principles for architecting scalable storage engines.  
 Ten years later, Shore-MT work has concluded, although the system still serves as a research platform in the space. Meanwhile, research on transaction processing scalability continues to mature, the move to main- memory transaction processing and their higher TPS increased the need for scalable storage managers, while the popular open-source systems, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, significantly improved their scalability. In particular, a significant amount of research and industrial developments in the ten years since the Shore-MT paper focused on improving the scalability of individual components of a storage manager, such as latches, the logging subsystem and access methods. This research was partly carried out by our research group as follow- on work, but other research groups and database vendors have made important contributions as well. Another significant amount of effort has focused on scalable concurrency control protocols, again both within and outside our research group. The knowledge that we have gained from building Shore-MT has been invaluable in maintaining scalability in this new, multi-dimensional ecosystem.

  Optimizing joins in a map-reduce environment   
  EDBT 2010, pp. 99-110 ( electronic edition  )   
  
 Abstract:   
  Implementations of map-reduce are being used to perform many operations on very large data. We examine strategies for joining several relations in the map-reduce environment. Our new approach begins by identifying the "map-key," the set of attributes that identify the Reduce process to which a Map process must send a particular tuple. Each attribute of the map-key gets a "share," which is the number of buckets into which its values are hashed, to form a component of the identifier of a Reduce process. Relations have their tuples replicated in limited fashion, the degree of replication depending on the shares for those map-key attributes that are missing from their schema. We study the problem of optimizing the shares, given a fixed number of Reduce processes. An algorithm for detecting and fixing problems where an attribute is "mistakenly" included in the map-key is given. Then, we consider two important special cases: chain joins and star joins. In each case we are able to determine the map-key and determine the shares that yield the least replication. While the method we propose is not always superior to the conventional way of using map-reduce to implement joins, there are some important cases involving large-scale data where our method wins, including: (1) analytic queries in which a very large fact table is joined with smaller dimension tables, and (2) queries involving paths through graphs with high out-degree, such as the Web or a social network.  
 This paper presented optimization strategies for executing multi-way joins in a map-reduce environment. It focused on large-scale data and provided algorithms to choose the number of map-keys and shares in order to minimize the communication cost among the map and reduce processes. The committee members agreed that this paper clearly pioneered the field of join processing in map-reduce environments. It has triggered substantial follow-up research and impact on big data processing in parallel and distributed architectures.

  SeMiTri: a framework for semantic annotation of heterogeneous trajectories   
  EDBT 2011, pp. 259-270 ( electronic edition  )   
  
 because it is one of the earliest papers to propose a general method for enriching moving object trajectories with semantics useful for supporting location-based services, which have been and still are in high demand across several application sectors. Since its publication, SeMiTri has generated significant interest, and follow-up work on semantic processing of mobile data and trajectories.  
 Abstract:   
  GPS devices allow recording the movement track of the moving object they are attached to. This data typically consists of a stream of spatio-temporal (x,y,t) points. For application purposes the stream is transformed into finite subsequences called trajectories. Existing knowledge extraction algorithms defined for trajectories mainly assume a specific context (e.g. vehicle movements) or analyze specific parts of a trajectory (e.g. stops), in association with data from chosen geographic sources (e.g. points-of-interest, road networks). We investigate a more comprehensive semantic annotation framework that allows enriching trajectories with any kind of semantic data provided by multiple 3rd party sources.  
  This paper presents SeMiTri - the framework that enables annotating trajectories for any kind of moving objects. Doing so, the application can benefit from a "semantic trajectory" representation of the physical movement. The framework and its algorithms have been designed to work on trajectories with varying data quality and different structures, with the objective of covering abstraction requirements of a wide range of applications. Performance of SeMiTri has been evaluated using many GPS datasets from multiple sources - including both fast moving objects (e.g. cars, trucks) and people's trajectories (e.g. with smartphones). These two kinds of experiments are reported in this paper.

  Efficient parallel kNN joins for large data in MapReduce

 The EDBT 2022 Test of Time Award committee was formed by Bill Howe, University of Washington, USA Julia Stoyanovich, New York University, USA Jens Teubner, TU Dortmund, Germany Xiaofang Zhou, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong.  
 Abstract:   
  In data mining applications and spatial and multimedia databases, a useful tool is the kNN join, which is to produce the k nearest neighbors (NN), from a dataset S, of every point in a dataset R. Since it involves both the join and the NN search, performing kNN joins efficiently is a challenging task. Meanwhile, applications continue to witness a quick (exponential in some cases) increase in the amount of data to be processed. A popular model nowadays for large-scale data processing is the shared-nothing cluster on a number of commodity machines using MapReduce [6]. Hence, how to execute kNN joins efficiently on large data that are stored in a MapReduce cluster is an intriguing problem that meets many practical needs. This work proposes novel (exact and approximate) algorithms in MapReduce to perform efficient parallel kNN joins on large data. We demonstrate our ideas using Hadoop. Extensive experiments in large real and syn- thetic datasets, with tens or hundreds of millions of records in both R and S and up to 30 dimensions, have demonstrated the efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of our methods.

  HIL: A High-Level Scripting Language for Entity Integration   
  EDBT 2013, pp. 549-560 ( electronic edition  )   
  
 The EDBT 2023 Test of Time Award committee was formed by Sihem Amer-Yahia Alon Halevy Divesh Srivastava.  
 Abstract:   
  We introduce HIL, a high-level scripting language for entity resolution and integration. HIL aims at providing the core logic for complex data processing flows that aggregate facts from large collections of structured or unstructured data into clean, unified entities. Such flows typically include many stages of processing that start from the outcome of information extraction and continue with entity resolution, mapping and fusion. A HIL program captures the overall integration flow through a combination of SQL-like rules that link, map, fuse and aggregate entities. A salient feature of HIL is the use of logical indexes in its data model to facilitate the modular construction and aggregation of complex entities. Another feature is the presence of a flexible, open type system that allows HIL to handle input data that is irregular, sparse or partially known. As a result, HIL can accurately express complex integration tasks while still being high-level and focused on the logical entities (rather than the physical operations). Compilation algorithms translate the HIL specification into efficient run-time queries that can execute in parallel on Hadoop. We show how our framework is applied to real-world integration of entities in the financial domain, based on public filings archived by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Furthermore, we apply HIL on a larger-scale scenario that performs fusion of data from hundreds of millions of Twitter messages into tens of millions of structured entities

  Reachability Queries in Very Large Graphs: A Fast Refined Online Search Approach

 The EDBT 2024 Test of Time Award committee was formed by Minos Garofalakis Davide Martinenghi Baihua Zheng.  
 Abstract:   
  A key problem in many graph-based applications is the need to know, given a directed graph G and two vertices u, v ∈ G whether there is a path between u and v, i. e., if u reaches v. This problem is particularly challenging in the case of very large real-world graphs. A common approach is the pre- processing of the graphs, in order to produce an efficient index structure, which allows fast access to the reachability information of the vertices. However, the majority of existing methods can not handle very large graphs. We propose in this paper, a novel indexing method called FELINE (Fast rEfined onLINE search), which is inspired by Dominance Graph Drawing. FELINE creates an index from the graph representation in a two-dimensional plane, which provides reachability information in constant time for a significant portion of queries. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of FELINE compared to state-of-the-art approaches

 Welcome to EDCC 2025!  
 Overview  
  The European Dependable Computing Conference is a leading venue for presenting and discussing the latest research, industrial practice and innovations in dependable and secure computing with a long tradition started in 1994 and reaching the 20 th  edition.  
 Lisbon, the vibrant capital of Portugal, is a city that effortlessly blends history, culture and modernity. Situated in coast of Portugal, where the Tagus river meets the Atlantic Ocean, it boasts a rich cultural heritage, from the medieval quarters to the iconic landmarks like the Castle of St. George and the Tower of Belém.  
   
 Latest news from EDCC    

  Lisbon is the home of the University of Lisbon (ULisboa), the largest and most prestigious university in Portugal and is one of Europe’s leading universities. Since its begin, ULisboa had a turbulent beginnings. In the words of A. Moreira Sá: "The Portuguese University was founded by King Dinis on March 1, 1290, and was transferred to Coimbra in 1308; thirty years later it was transferred back to Lisbon and then, in 1354, it was moved once again to Coimbra. However King Fernando ordered, on June 3, 1377, its transferal back to Lisbon, where it stayed for 160 years without interruption - more precisely during the Discoveries, a period which greatly benefitted from the contributions of several of its students and teachers (among many others, the sailor Gil Eanes and two key scientific figures: Pedro Nunes and Garcia de Orta)."  
 With more seven centuries, ULisboa brings together various areas of knowledge and has a privileged position for facilitating the contemporary evolution of science, technology, arts and humanities. The quality of teaching, research innovation and culture of ULisboa is attracting an ever increasing amount of talent from around the world.  
 We will host you in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (FCUL), an integral and founding unit of ULisboa, created by Decree in 1911, which takes on the historical, cultural and scientific heritage of its ancestors: Noviciado da Cotovia (1619-1759), Real Colégio dos Nobres (1761-1837), and Escola Politécnica (1837-1911).  
 The FCUL’s motto is What we do not know today, we will know tomorrow (Garcia de Orta, 1563).   
 FCUL integrates the Department of Informatics and LASIGE research unit, characterized by the excellence of its research international visibility, and close connection to society. LASIGE performs cutting-edge investigation in seven Research Lines of Excellence related to Computer Science. The Dependable and Secure Decentralised Systems and Cyber-Physical Systems research lines play an essential role in the generation of new knowledge in data privacy security for software systems, network and distributed systems.  
 Please mark your calendars and don’t hesitate to contact us at ivmedeiros@fc.ul.pt  !

 Overview  
  We live in turbulent times where technology is ever-changing, and new paradigms keep arising. Many of them could be game changers from an industrial perspective, like in-memory and quantum computing or novel artificial intelligence techniques. However, their dependable and secure adoption in computer-based systems we rely on for our everyday lives (from edge devices to large-scale systems) is far from simple.  
 The European Dependable Computing Conference (EDCC) is a pivotal event in the domain of dependable and secure computing systems. It serves as a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss their latest research results on theory, techniques, systems, and tools for the design, validation, operation and evaluation of dependable and secure computing systems.  
 In addition to original research papers, EDCC welcomes contributions on dependability and security in practice and their application to industrial domains. The conference also provides a natural meeting place for ongoing dependability and security projects to present their state of advancement and innovative results.  
 The conference program will be enriched by workshops, a student forum, fast abstracts and posters tracks, offering an ideal venue for exchanging ideas and networking.  
 The flyer for the call for papers is now available for download  .

 Welcome to EDCC 2025!  
 Overview  
  The European Dependable Computing Conference is a leading venue for presenting and discussing the latest research, industrial practice and innovations in dependable and secure computing with a long tradition started in 1994 and reaching the 20 th  edition.  
 Lisbon, the vibrant capital of Portugal, is a city that effortlessly blends history, culture and modernity. Situated in coast of Portugal, where the Tagus river meets the Atlantic Ocean, it boasts a rich cultural heritage, from the medieval quarters to the iconic landmarks like the Castle of St. George and the Tower of Belém.  
   
 Latest news from EDCC    

  Lisbon is the home of the University of Lisbon (ULisboa), the largest and most prestigious university in Portugal and is one of Europe’s leading universities. Since its begin, ULisboa had a turbulent beginnings. In the words of A. Moreira Sá: "The Portuguese University was founded by King Dinis on March 1, 1290, and was transferred to Coimbra in 1308; thirty years later it was transferred back to Lisbon and then, in 1354, it was moved once again to Coimbra. However King Fernando ordered, on June 3, 1377, its transferal back to Lisbon, where it stayed for 160 years without interruption - more precisely during the Discoveries, a period which greatly benefitted from the contributions of several of its students and teachers (among many others, the sailor Gil Eanes and two key scientific figures: Pedro Nunes and Garcia de Orta)."  
 With more seven centuries, ULisboa brings together various areas of knowledge and has a privileged position for facilitating the contemporary evolution of science, technology, arts and humanities. The quality of teaching, research innovation and culture of ULisboa is attracting an ever increasing amount of talent from around the world.  
 We will host you in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (FCUL), an integral and founding unit of ULisboa, created by Decree in 1911, which takes on the historical, cultural and scientific heritage of its ancestors: Noviciado da Cotovia (1619-1759), Real Colégio dos Nobres (1761-1837), and Escola Politécnica (1837-1911).  
 The FCUL’s motto is What we do not know today, we will know tomorrow (Garcia de Orta, 1563).   
 FCUL integrates the Department of Informatics and LASIGE research unit, characterized by the excellence of its research international visibility, and close connection to society. LASIGE performs cutting-edge investigation in seven Research Lines of Excellence related to Computer Science. The Dependable and Secure Decentralised Systems and Cyber-Physical Systems research lines play an essential role in the generation of new knowledge in data privacy security for software systems, network and distributed systems.
