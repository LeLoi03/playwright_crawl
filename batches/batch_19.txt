 The aim of PQCrypto is to serve as a forum for researchers to present results and exchange ideas on cryptography in an era with large-scale quantum computers. Original research papers on all technical aspects of cryptographic research related to post-quantum cryptography are solicited. Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):  
 Cryptanalysis of post-quantum systems, and quantum cryptanalysis. 
  Cryptosystems that have the potential to be safe against quantum computers such as: | code-based, 
  hash-based, 
  isogeny-based, 
  lattice-based, and 
  multivariate constructions. 
  Implementations of, and side-channel attacks on, post-quantum cryptosystems. 
  Integration of and migration to post-quantum cryptography. 
  Security models for the post-quantum era.

 Paper Submission  
 Submission Server  Instructions to authors  
 Accepted papers are planned to be published in Springer’s LNCS series. Submissions must not exceed 30 pages, excluding  appendices and references, and must be in a single column format in 10pt fonts using the default llncs class without adjustments. Additional material (datasets, code, long machine proofs, etc.) can be submitted as separate file. Reviewers are not required to read appendices and additional material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible and complete without them.  
 If the submission is accepted, the length of the final version is at most 35 pages including  references and appendices, in the llncs class format. The additional material will not be part of the conference proceedings. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published in a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings, or has submitted/is planning to submit before the author notification deadline to a journal or other conferences/ workshops that have proceedings.  
 The review process is single-blinded.  The submission should begin with a title, the authors' names and affiliations  , a short abstract, and a list of key words. Its introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submissions ignoring these guidelines may be rejected without further consideration.  
 All papers must be submitted with a meaningful abstract by the initial submission deadline. This is a firm deadline. Papers not registered by this deadline will not be considered. Authors may update or withdraw their submission at any time between the initial and final submission deadline.  
  Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

About  
 IEEE PRDC 2024 is the twenty-nine event in the series of symposia started in 1989 that are devoted to dependable and fault-tolerant computing. PRDC is recognized as the main event in the Pacific area that covers many dimensions of dependability and fault tolerance, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental projects, and commercial components and systems. As applications of computing systems have permeated into all aspects of daily life, the dependability of computing system has become increasingly critical. This symposium provides a forum for countries around the Pacific Rim and other areas of the world to exchange ideas for improving the dependability of computing systems.

 PPSN was originally designed to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of Natural Computing, the study of computing approaches which are gleaned from natural models. Today, the conference series has evolved and welcomes works on all types of iterative optimization heuristics. Notably, we also welcome submissions on connections between search heuristics and machine learning or other artificial intelligence approaches. Submissions covering the entire spectrum of work, ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies, are invited.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-03-31

 Paper Submission  
 Submission Server  Instructions to authors  
 Accepted papers are planned to be published in Springer’s LNCS series. Submissions must not exceed 30 pages, excluding  appendices and references, and must be in a single column format in 10pt fonts using the default llncs class without adjustments. Additional material (datasets, code, long machine proofs, etc.) can be submitted as separate file. Reviewers are not required to read appendices and additional material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible and complete without them.  
 If the submission is accepted, the length of the final version is at most 35 pages including  references and appendices, in the llncs class format. The additional material will not be part of the conference proceedings. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published in a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings, or has submitted/is planning to submit before the author notification deadline to a journal or other conferences/ workshops that have proceedings.  
 The review process is single-blinded.  The submission should begin with a title, the authors' names and affiliations  , a short abstract, and a list of key words. Its introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submissions ignoring these guidelines may be rejected without further consideration.  
 All papers must be submitted with a meaningful abstract by the initial submission deadline. This is a firm deadline. Papers not registered by this deadline will not be considered. Authors may update or withdraw their submission at any time between the initial and final submission deadline.  
  Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

 IEEE PRDC 2025 |  
 30th IEEE Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing (PRDC) 
 Dates: TBD 
 Venue: TBD, TBD  , TBD 

 IEEE PRDC is the symposia started in 1989 that are devoted to dependable and fault-tolerant computing. PRDC is recognized as the main event in the Pacific area that covers many dimensions of dependability and fault tolerance, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental projects, and commercial components and systems. As applications of computing systems have permeated into all aspects of daily life, the dependability of computing system has become increasingly critical. This symposium provides a forum for countries around the Pacific Rim and other areas of the world to exchange ideas for improving the dependability of computing systems.

 Jakarta, Indonesia  
 November 15-19, 2023 
  The Pacific Rim International Conference Series on Artificial Intelligence 

 PRICAI History  
 The Pacific Rim International Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI) was initiated in Japan in 1990, to create an artificial intelligence (AI) conference which would promote collaborative exploitation of AI in the Pacific Rim nations.  
 The conference has grown, both in participation and scope, and now includes participation from all major Asia Pacific nations. The conference also attracts participation from all over the world, including Europe, Africa, India, and South America.  

 Call for Proposals to Host PRICAI-2026  
 The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI) is an international event which concentrates on AI theories, technologies and their applications in the areas of social and economic importance for countries in the Pacific Rim. It aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, educators and users in AI and related communities for in-depth intellectual exchanges, research cooperation and professional development. Founded in 1990, PRICAI conferences were held biennially in even-number years since then. From 2019, PRICAI became an annual event. Please visit PRICAI website  for the list of past and upcoming conferences.  
 PRICAI Steering Committee hereby invites proposals to host the 23 rd  Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2026)  to be held in a Pacific Rim country around November 2026  . These proposals will be evaluated by the PRICAI Steering Committee during its meeting.  
 The proposal should be short but provide sufficient details on the:  
 Proposed organizing committee, including | one (1) | Conference Chair and | one (1) | Program Chair. 
  The primary contact person who will interact with PRICAI. 
  Detailed information of the hosted site and potential support from the local authority. 
  Potential conference venues and accommodations (with different budget tiers). 
  Logistics (visa, flights and transportation), weather, etc. 
  Detailed budget estimates (including break-even figures) as a function of the expected number of participants. 
  Potential sponsorships. 
  Please email your proposal to the Secretary of PRICAI Steering Committee   .  

 Current and Upcoming PRICAI conferences  
 We are pleased to announce that:  
 PRICAI 2024, the 21 | st | edition of the conference series, will be in Kyoto (Japan). Please visit | PRICAI-2024 website | for more information.

 1.  Topographia hibernica  
 by Blindboy Boatclub  
 €9.49    
 'Memorable, unsettling and humane' GUARDIAN 'One of the best books I have ever read ... I can't recommend him or it enough' JOHNNY MARR 'One of the most gifted writers of his generation' IRISH TIMES Driving with a donkey stuffed in the back seat; jackdaws pecking brains out through the roof of a confessional box; cat piss and astronauts. This is not the world as you see it, but as it is, twisted from the maverick mind of Blindboy Boatclub. These are stories of the strange unsettlings in the souls of men caught in between the past and the possible; stories of heart-blinding rage and disquieting compassion. Blindboy Boatclub is the essential voice for the Irish condition in the twenty-first century, and in Topographia Hibernica he unravels the knotted threads of humanity, nature and colonisation from a contemporary perspective. * Topographia Hibernica was a bestseller in Ireland in November 2023 *

 4.  A Winter to Remember  
 by Roisin Meaney  
 €9.49    
 'Heart-warming and unputdownable' Carmel Harrington Emily loves the festive season. This year she's hosting a special Christmas lunch at her restaurant to celebrate with family and friends. But as the big day draws near, her plans begin to unravel ... Emily and her partner Bill are happily raising his grandson Pip when Bill's troubled daughter Christine turns up out of the blue. She wants to pick up the pieces of her life, and to reclaim her son. Can Emily give up the boy she's come to love as her own? And how can she ask Bill to choose between the two women he loves? Emily's best friend Heather is also dealing with unexpected arrivals: the mother she left behind as a teenager, who now needs her help, and a man she thought she'd never see again. But Heather wonders if these reunions will heal past wounds, or only disrupt the happiness she has now. As Emily and Heather's lives become more and more complicated, will they find their way back to happiness and the people they love in time for Christmas Day? What readers are saying about A Winter to Remember: 'Beautiful ... it totally enchanted me' 'Heart-warming ... a cosy story to keep you smiling' 'A lovely wintery, festive read' 'Cosy and heart-warming' 'Gorgeous ... a must read, particularly for autumn and winter days' 'A perfect Christmas read' 'There is something magical about festive books and this one is no exception'

 5.  It ends with us (film tie in)  
 by Colleen Hoover  
 €9.49    
 THE MULTI-MILLION-COPY GLOBAL BESTSELLER. SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOVIE. Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn't hurt. Lily can't get him out of her head. But Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his "no dating" rule, she can't help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel, It Ends With Us is a heart-wrenching story and an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.

 6.  Fiance Dilemma  
 by Elena Armas  
 €9.49    
 Josie Moore has given the opposite sex––and love––plenty of chances. Four exactly, if you count all her failed engagements, and five if you include the absentee father who kept her existence a secret until very recently. So when her father decides to announce his retirement with a splashy magazine piece about the family, Josie realizes her romantic history is a complicated PR issue. Matthew Flanagan is the mud, literally. Not only has he been fired from his job, but also the tires of his car are stuck in the muck after taking a wrong turn as he enters Green Oak, North Carolina. So, he grabs a duffel with his essentials and goes in b search of a place to crash until he gets his life back on track. But instead, he finds his best friend’s sister, Josie, greeting him as her fiancé. What starts as a big messy misunderstanding quickly turns into an arrangement with Matthew playing a new role as doting fiancé. A fifth engagement––and a stunt, at that––makes Josie’s stomach turn, but every dilemma requires a choice between equally undesirable alternatives, and Matthew doesn’t seem to mind becoming one more number in a colourful list of grooms-that-never-were. Despite the ring on her finger, Josie knows this is only temporary, even if the rest of the small town believes that the fifth time’s the charm.

 by Chris Hadfield  
 €9.49    
 'A full throttle, adrenaline-laced espionage page-turner . . . Get ready to blast off and enjoy the ride!' Jack Carr, former Navy SEAL Sniper and #1 New York Times bestselling author of the James Reece Terminal List series 'Continuous action, Mach-speed mayhem, sharp intrigue, and well-rounded characters - what more could you want from a thriller?' Steve Berry, New York Times bestselling author of The 9th Man and the Cotton Malone series Israel, late 1973. As the Yom Kippur War flares into life, a state-of-the-art Soviet MIG fighter is racing at breakneck speed over the arid scrublands below . . . and promptly disappears. NASA Flight Controller and former US Navy test pilot Kaz Zemeckis watches the scene from the ground - and is quickly pulled into a dizzying, high-stakes game of spies, lies and a possible high-level defection that plays out across three continents. The prize is beyond value: the secrets of the Soviets' mythical 'Foxbat' MiG-25, the fastest, highest-flying fighter plane in the world and the key to Cold War air supremacy. But every defection is double-edged with risk, and Kaz must tread a careful line between trust and suspicion. Ultimately, he must invite the fox into the henhouse - bringing the defector into the heart of the United States' most secret test site - and hope that, with skill and cunning, the game plays out his way. For Chris Hadfield's second heart-stopping thriller, we move from Space to another rich and exciting part of Chris's CV: his time as a top test pilot in both the US Air Force and the US Navy, and as an RCAF fighter pilot intercepting armed Soviet bombers in North American airspace. Full of insider detail, excitement and political intrigue drawn from real events, The Defector brings us the nerve-shredding rush of aerial combat, as told by one of the world's best fighter pilots.

 'You'll be lucky if you read a more engaging novel this year' The Times Thriller of the Month 'Small Mercies is thought-provoking, engaging, enraging, and can't-put-it-down entertainment' Stephen King 'A jaw-dropping thriller... a resonant, unflinching story written by a novelist who is simply one of the best around' Gillian Flynn New York Time s bestselling author Dennis Lehane returns with a masterpiece to rival Mystic River: an all-consuming tale of revenge, family love, festering hate, and insidious power, set against one of the most tumultuous episodes in Boston's history. In the summer of 1974 a heatwave blankets Boston and Mary Pat Fennessey is trying to stay one step ahead of the bill collectors. Mary Pat has lived her entire life in the housing projects of 'Southie', the Irish American enclave that stubbornly adheres to old tradition and stands proudly apart. One night Mary Pat's teenage daughter Jules stays out late and doesn't come home. That same evening, a young Black man is found dead, struck by a subway train under mysterious circumstances. The two events seem unconnected. But Mary Pat, propelled by a desperate search for her missing daughter, begins turning over stones best left untouched - asking questions that bother Marty Butler, chieftain of the Irish mob, and the men who work for him, men who don't take kindly to any threat to their business. Set against the hot, tumultuous months when the city's desegregation of its public schools exploded in violence, Small Mercies is a superb thriller, a brutal depiction of criminality and power, and an unflinching portrait of the dark heart of American racism.

After oil was discovered beneath their land, they rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions and sent their children to study in Europe. Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. As the death toll climbed, the FBI took up the case. But the bureau badly bungled the investigation. In desperation, its young director, J.

She's his opposite in every way . . . and the greatest temptation he's ever known. Reserved, controlled, and proper to a fault, Kai Young has neither the time nor inclination for chaos - and Isabella, with her purple hair and inappropriate jokes, is chaos personified. With a crucial CEO vote looming and a media empire at stake, the billionaire heir can't afford the distraction she brings. Isabella is everything he shouldn't want, but with every look and every touch, he's tempted to break all his rules . . . and claim her as his own. *** Bold, impulsive, and full of life, Isabella Valencia has never met a party she doesn't like or a man she couldn't charm . . . except for Kai Young. It shouldn't matter. He's not her type - the man translates classics into Latin for fun, and his membership at the exclusive club where she bartends means he's strictly off limits. But she can't deny that, beneath his cool exterior, is a man who could make her melt with just a touch. No matter how hard they try, they can't resist giving into their forbidden desires.

Dante Russo thrives on control, both personally and professionally. The billionaire CEO never planned to marry - until the threat of blackmail forces him into an engagement with a woman he barely knows: Vivian Lau, jewellery heiress and daughter of his newest enemy. It doesn't matter how beautiful or charming she is. He'll do everything in his power to destroy the evidence and their betrothal. There's only one problem: now that he has her . . . he can't bring himself to let her go. *** Elegant. Ambitious. Well-mannered. Vivian Lau is the perfect daughter and her family's ticket into the highest echelons of high society. Marrying a blue-blooded Russo means opening doors that would otherwise remain closed to her new-money family. While the rude, elusive Dante isn't her idea of a dream partner, she agrees to their arranged marriage out of duty. Craving his touch was never part of the plan. Neither was the worst thing she could possibly do: fall in love with her future husband. King of Wrath is a steamy arranged marriage billionaire romance. It includes explicit content and profanity.

However, none infuriate - or tempt - her more than a certain billionaire heir, with his stupid dimples and laid-back attitude.

 A dangerous alliance between a Vampyre bride and an Alpha werewolf becomes a love deep enough to sink your teeth into in this new paranormal romance from the New York Times bestselling author of The Love Hypothesis. Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyre councilman of the Southwest, is an outcast - again. Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold an historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange - again . . . Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It's clear from the way he tracks Misery's every movement that he doesn't trust her. If only he knew how right he was . . . Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what's hers, even if it means a life alone in Were territory . . . alone with the wolf.

 104.  Unfortunately Yours  
 by Tessa Bailey  
 €9.49    
 #1 New York Times bestselling author Tessa Bailey is back in Napa Valley with this hilarious rom-com about a down-on-her-luck heiress who suggests a mutually beneficial marriage of convenience to a man she can't stand... only to discover there's a fine line between love and hate. After losing her job and her fiancé in one fell swoop, Natalie Vos returned home to lick her wounds. A few months later, she's sufficiently drowned her sorrows in cabernet and she's ready to get back on her feet. She just needs her trust fund to finance her new business venture. Unfortunately, the terms require she marry before she can have the money. And well, dumped, remember? But Natalie is desperate enough to propose to a man who makes her want to kill him-and kiss him, in equal measure. August Cates may own a vineyard, but he doesn't know jack about making wine. He's determined to do his late best friend proud, no matter what it takes. Except his tasting room is empty, his wine is disgusting (seriously, he once saw someone gag), and his buddy's legacy is circling the drain. No bank will give him the loan he needs to turn the business around... and then the gorgeous, feisty heiress knocks on his door. Natalie has haunted August's dreams since the moment they met, but their sizzling chemistry immediately morphed into simmering insults. Now, a quickie marriage could help them both. A sham wedding, a few weeks living under the same roof, and then they can go their separate ways-assuming they make it out alive. How hard could it be? There's just one thing they didn't account for: their unfortunate, unbearable, undeniable attraction.

Mallory Greenleaf is done with chess. Every move counts nowadays; after the sport led to the destruction of her family four years earlier, Mallory's focus is on her mom, her sisters, and the dead-end job that keeps the lights on.

Nolan's loss to an unknown rookie shocks everyone. What's even more confusing? His desire to cross pawns again. What kind of gambit is Nolan playing? The smart move would be to walk away. Resign.

As she rockets up the ranks, Mallory struggles to keep her family safely separated from the game that wrecked it in the first place.

 Scope and Background   
 The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI) is an annual global event focusing on AI theories, technologies, and their practical applications across scientific, social, and economic domains relevant to the Pacific Rim’s unique social and economic challenges. Previous PRICAI conferences have been held in Gold Coast (2014), Phuket (2016), Nanjing (2018), Fiji (2019), Yokohama (2020), Hanoi (2021), Shanghai (2022), and Jakarta (2023). The 21st Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2024) will be held at the Clock Tower Centennial Hall of Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The Program Committee invites technical papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all areas of Artificial Intelligence. PRICAI 2024 aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, educators, and users in AI and related communities for in-depth intellectual exchanges, research cooperation, and professional development.  
  
 Paper Submission   
 Proceedings of PRICAI 2024 will be published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) proceedings volume. PRICAI 2024 solicits regular and short papers. Regular papers may be up to 12 pages in length, including references, while short papers may be up to 6 pages, including references. All papers should be submitted electronically using the conference management tool in PDF format and formatted using the Springer LNAI template. Submitted papers must not be published or under consideration to be published elsewhere. PRICAI reviewing follows a double-blind process. Authors are unaware of the identities of the reviewers, and reviewers cannot deduce the names of the authors from the submission. Authors must refrain from including any information that might reveal their identities anywhere in the submission. Failure to adhere to this guideline could result in rejection without review.

 Agents are software processes that perceive and act in an environment, processing their perceptions to make intelligent decisions about actions to achieve their goals. Multi-agent systems have multiple agents that work in the same environment to achieve either joint or conflicting goals. Agent computing and technology is an exciting, emerging paradigm expected to play a key role in many society-changing practices from disaster response to manufacturing to agriculture. Agent and mul- agent researchers are focused on building working systems that bring together a broad range of technical areas from market theory to software engineering to user interfaces. Agent systems are expected to operate in real-world environments, with all the challenges complex environments present. After 11 successful PRIMA workshops/conferences (Pacific-Rim International Conference/Workshop on Multi-Agents), PRIMA became a new conference titled “International Conference on Principles of Practice in Multi-Agent Systems” in 2009. With over 100 submissions, an acceptance rate for full papers of 25% and 50% for posters, a demonstration session, an industry track, a RoboCup competition and workshops and tutorials, PRIMA has become an important venue for multi-agent research. Papers submitted are from all parts of the world, though with a higher representation of Pacific Rim countries than other major multi-agent research forums. This volume presents 34 high-quality and exciting technical papers on multimedia research and an additional 18 poster papers that give brief views on exciting research.

 PROFES  
 PROFES, the International Conference on on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement, is among the top recognized software development and process improvement conferences.  
 The objective of the International Conference on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement (PROFES) is to provide a premier forum for practitioners, researchers, and educators to present and discuss experiences, ideas, innovations, as well as concerns related to professional software process improvement motivated by product ans service quality needs.  
 PROFES conferences encourage the exchange of ideas that help explore, understand, and model phenomena in software engineering from the point of view of process-product relationships. Traditionally, PROFES provides topics, which are up-to-date, important, and interesting to both practitioners and researchers. To ensure that PROFES will retain its high standards and that it will keep focusing on the most relevant research issues, we are looking for original research on current trends in software engineering aspects addressing products and services. Further, PROFES asks for studies reporting about the application of respective methods or technologies in real settings.  
 PROFES cares about fundamental ethical values related to diversity, as gender, ethnicity, disability, religion, and similar personal traits. Diversity will be sought at different levels, remarkably including conference committees' composition.  
 PROFES conference organizers will set as highest priority to provide a welcoming, respectful and positive atmosphere to all attendees. Aggressive or offensive language will not be allowed in talks, questions or answers. Aggressive or offensive behaviour, including any type of harassing, will not be allowed in the event, being a justified reason for expulsion without any compensation. For more details on PROFES Conferences Code of Conduct see here   
 All PROFES conference committees as well as authors are obliged to follow and apply the Ethical Guideline as available at SPRINGER  (replacing journal by conference).  
 On this web site you can find information about the PROFES conference series as well as useful information for organizing a future PROFES conference.

 List of special sessions  
 Special Session 1: Collaborative Networks as Driver of Innovation in Organizations 5.0  
 CoDEMO EU project is dedicated to developing at the European level, innovation capabilities for 5.0 organizations in multiple activity sectors, namely industry, healthcare and agri-technology. Capabilities for innovation and transformation towards 5.0 organizations are deeply based on the capacity of collaboration among various socio-economic actors, including companies, innovation centres, vocational training providers, universities and others.  
 The concept of 5.0 organization complements 4.0 logics and principles by focussing more on developing a sustainable, human-centric, and resilient (business) environment considered as more appropriate in a non-linear world. The advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to strategically improve and optimize global supply chains (SC). With the help of networked technologies and smart digital ecosystems, 5.0 organizations aim to provide more sustainable means of value creation, better (business) results and advancements in SC resiliency.  
 The objective of this special session, is to make the link between the innovation and competence requirements for the transition towards 5.0 organizations and the needs, opportunities and practices of collaborative networks consisting of various types of socio-economic actors.  
 The Special Session will welcome theoretical, empirical as well as pragmatic contributions on topics like: collaborative network modalities to support 5.0 innovation & transition, 5.0 competence needs supported by collaborative innovation activities, collaboration needs/requirements for 5.0 organisations in specific sectors like industry, healthcare or agri-technology, experimentation of collaborative networks supporting 5.0 transition, assessment of collaborative capabilities for 5.0 organizations, 5.0 laboratories for education, learning, professional training or transfer. All other contributions that relate to the main field of 5.0 organization are also very much appreciated.  
 Topics:  
 Collaborative networks for 5.0 transition towards human-centricity, sustainability and resilience of organizations 5.0 
  Collaboration needs, opportunities and practice for innovation of 5.0 organizations 
  Collaboration to support 5.0 skills and competence developments 
  Collaborative strategies and management of 5.0 organizations 
  Innovation 5.0 development in collaborative networks 
  Collaborative innovation in specific sectors like industry, health or agri-food and others 
  Collaborative decision-making processes in industry, health or agri-food supply chains 
  Hybrid human-machine collaboration to optimize industry, healthcare or agri-food processes 
  Collaborative healthcare networks with hospitals, labs, and medical institutions 
  Collaborative networks in education fostering the transition from 4.0 to 5.0

 Special Session 2: Fostering Collaborative and Interoperable Digital Models for Digital Twins  
 Digitization received significant attention by new European Commission strategies. To improve digitalization’s maturity, it is important to develop technology-driven frameworks such as digital twins (DT). The proposed special session aims at inviting approaches for developing FAIR (Findable Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) digital models for digital twins with a collaborative capability, which hold immense potential for various industries from manufacturing to healthcare. The development of mature collaborative DTs highly relies on high fidelity digital models that will be included within the virtual entity (VE) dimension of DTs, which includes different types of digital models, such as behavioural geometric, rules, physic, geospatial, and assets. In this session, we are looking for contributions and guidelines on deduction/extraction of digital models facilitating knowledge exchange that enables these models to be interoperable among themselves and integrate different information and elements to offer collaborative capabilities for digital twins. Such interoperable models, endorse collaboration among different DTs at different aggregation levels (i.e., Unit level DT, System level DT, System of Systems level DT).  
 This special session will be endorsed by the Digital Twin Technical Committee of the SAGIP ( https://www.sagip.org/fr  ).

 Special Session 3: Empowering Vulnerable Populations Wellbeing through Collaborative Networks  
 Vulnerable populations as migrants, refugees, ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, vulnerable women, low-income homeless, LGBTQ+ communities, etc., are often affected by different types of discrimination that beyond doubt affect their wellbeing. One way of mitigating this problem is to perform a comprehensive exploration of key themes aimed at enhancing the wellbeing of vulnerable populations through the lens of collaborative networks.  
 In this regard, this special session addresses concerns on how the stakeholders' engagement within these networks can be performed, with a focus on understanding how their involvement contributes to the empowerment of vulnerable individuals. At this level, it is also relevant to properly understand and evaluate emerging technologies and strategic approaches dedicated to ensuring confidentiality and trust within collaborative networks, acknowledging their pivotal role in fostering a secure environment for vulnerable populations. Furthermore contributions to this session may include research on mechanisms to facilitate agile access to data and fostering knowledge creation for vulnerable individuals, exploring cutting-edge recommendation systems continuous supervision, and monitoring methodologies, aiming to elevate the outcomes of networks designed to support vulnerable populations. A particular emphasis can be placed on the integration of generative-AI solutions, assessing their efficiency in providing tailored services that address the unique needs and challenges faced by vulnerable individuals.  
 In addition, in this session it is also welcomed research on user-tailored interfaces and adaptable digital solutions, aiming to create accessible and user-friendly platforms specifically designed to cater to the diverse requirements of vulnerable populations. Moreover the role of social media in the empowerment of vulnerable populations should be analyzed, considering its impact on communication, awareness and community support. Overall, this special session expects to include contributions for a comprehensive examination of collaborative networks and associated technologies, providing insights into their potential to positively impact the wellbeing of vulnerable populations.

 Special Session 4: Trust and trustworthy technologies in collaborative networks  
 Collaborative networks of enterprises are currently challenged by high unpredictabilities. The global environment has further developed from a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) into a brittle, anxious, nonlinear and incomprehensible (BANI) world. Given these conditions, timely and credible information sharing among collaborative network partners is but one of the vital sources of an efficient network. Research shows, that (re)establishing and pertaining trust in a collaborative network as a specific organizational form in general and between network partners and further stakeholders in a more specific perspective make up a key network management challenge. However, as the collaboration in larger networks becomes increasingly virtual and anonymous, especially if the distance of tiers in a supply network is high, trust can no longer be built solely upon personal relationships. Rather, it is the intelligent interplay of organizational, human and technological (digital) relationship enablers that substantially contributes to trust in collaborative networks in a BANI world. One particular innovative technology which addresses network trust is the distributed (digital) ledger technology (DLT) (i.e. "blockchain"). This session aims to strengthen the scientific discourse on the challenges of implementing and managing this trustworthy technology in collaborative virtual networks of enterprises. With respect to DLT enabled collaborative networks (in contrast to rather linear chains) we invite scholars to address, among other, topics as: dimensions and qualities of trust; psychological technological and/or organizational representations of trust; reciprocity of human and DLT trustworthiness; trust related managerial procedures, indicators and measures of successful DLT implementation; or even newly arising blind spots in understanding and managing trust and trustworthiness in DLT enabled collaborative networks.  
 Topics:  
 Trust in collaboration 
  Trust in virtual networks of enterprises 
  Reciprocity and interplay of trust enablers 
  Distributed ledger technology/ blockchain 
  Management of digital technologies in networks

 Special Session 5: Collaborative Manufacturing Systems in the Digital Era  
 The manufacturing industry continuously faces critical challenges such as supply chain disruptions, political instability, increasing competition, mass customization, and skill shortage. As a result, companies are implementing a more adaptive approach, leveraging globally dispersed, scalable, and sustainable production systems and resources. Also, these challenges force the industry to be more efficient, agile, and robust than ever. Collaboration between various stakeholders such as machine builders, product designers, manufacturers, and end-customers is one of the opportunities to overcome these challenges. Collaborative manufacturing effort involves sharing resources, knowledge, expertise and risks as well as the business gain while meeting the requirements of all stakeholders involved. This paradigm embodies a novel strategy to foster greater efficiency and resilience in the manufacturing industry. Successful digital collaborative manufacturing platforms, such as GAIA-X, allow manufacturers to share their production capacity and facilitate consumers to access up-to-date resource availabilities transparently and affordably. Although there are efforts to establish an industry-standard digital infrastructure for collaborative manufacturing systems, there are research questions in this landscape such as making these systems more human-centric by exploiting Industry 5.0 technologies, allowing collaborators to jointly design the products and value chain, utilizing generative AI and machine learning technologies to advance the current cyber-physical systems to be more cognitive developing smart methods for efficient, fair and inclusive resource sharing. Hence, this special session aims to bring together practitioners and researchers in collaborative manufacturing systems and facilitate knowledge exchange for best practices and state-of-the-art research to answer these questions. Studies that discuss industry maturity levels for collaborative manufacturing adaptation, social economic, and business barriers along with proposed resolutions are also invited to submit a paper to the special session.  
 Topics:  
 Sustainable and resilient collaborative manufacturing systems 
  Multi-agent Methods for planning and scheduling collaborative manufacturing systems 
  Collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems 
  Collaborative Platforms

 Special Session 6: Zero Defects and Zero Waste strategies in Industrial Collaborative Networks  
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data driven solutions towards Zero Defects and Zero Waste (ZDZW) solutions apply digital technologies to eliminate product and process errors and resource waste. Developing these solutions requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders (e.g., AI engineers, data scientist, system integrators) in complex collaborative networks. Technologies like blockchain, data spaces, or Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) emerge as enablers to achieve effective collaborations in the digital domain.  
 This special session focuses on discussing and disseminating real cases under development in different research initiatives. The session will address specific challenges related to the integration (collaboration robotics, data space, standardisation, interoperability, untrustworthy environments, etc.) of new sensors and the application of artificial intelligence for the detection, identification, and quantification of production defects or resource waste on a real-time basis.  
 Some of the use cases covered include a) blockchain based architectures for Inspection as a Service (IaaS) enabling the data sharing between participants to be performed in a decentralised, transparent, and secure cloud manufacturing system, building trust between them, b) cloud native robotics to enable safe, dynamic, and real-time decision-making for a collaborative working environment between humans and robots and c) Use of Data Spaces for zero waste solutions in the time critical bio-production section.  
 Topics:  
 Zero Defects strategies for collaborative manufacturing 
  Smart manufacturing using collaborative networks 
  Non-destructive inspection technologies for collaborative systems 
  Blockchain technology for Inspection as a Service in untrustworthy collaborative environments 
  Sustainable growth in collaborative manufacturing based in non-destructive inspection technologies

 Welcome to the website of the 2024 edition of the International Conference on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement (PROFES).   
 PROFES is among the top recognized software development and process improvement conferences.The objective is to provide a premier forum for practitioners, researchers, and educators to present and discuss experiences, ideas, innovations, as well as concerns related to professional software process improvement motivated by product and service quality needs.  
 PROFES conferences encourage the exchange of ideas that help explore, understand, and model phenomena in software engineering from the point of view of process-product relationships. Traditionally, PROFES provides topics, which are up-to-date, important, and interesting to both practitioners and researchers. To ensure that PROFES will retain its high standards and that it will keep focusing on the most relevant research issues, we are looking for original research on current trends in software engineering aspects addressing products and services. Further, PROFES asks for studies reporting about the application of respective methods or technologies in real settings.  
 PROFES cares about fundamental ethical values related to diversity, as gender, ethnicity, disability, religion, and similar personal traits. Diversity will be sought at different levels, remarkably including conference committees’ composition.  
 PROFES conference organizers will set as highest priority to provide a welcoming, respectful and positive atmosphere to all attendees. Aggressive or offensive language will not be allowed in talks, questions or answers. Aggressive or offensive behaviour, including any type of harassing, will not be allowed in the event, being a justified reason for expulsion without any compensation. For more details on PROFES Conferences Code of Conduct see [link will soon be added].  
 All PROFES conference committees as well as authors are obliged to follow and apply the Ethical Guideline as available at SPRINGER.

  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 

 Internet is changing some of our life and business styles. In addition, maturation of ubiquitous computing technology, particularly advances in positioning and telecommunication systems, allows us to design advanced assistance systems for many aspects of our lives.   

 Cognitive Architectures and Multi-agent Social Simulation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.7-21 

 As we know, a cognitive architecture is a domain-generic computational cognitive model that may be used for a broad analysis of cognition and behavior. Cognitive architectures embody theories of cognition in computer algorithms and programs. Social simulation with multi-agent systems can benefit from incorporating cognitive architectures, as they provide a realistic basis for modeling individual agents (as argued in Sun 2001). In this survey, an example cognitive architecture will be given, and its application to social simulation will be sketched.   

 A Co-operative Intelligent Assisting Agent Architecture for Web Searching and Desktop Management    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.22-32 

 The rapid growth in technology has made the computer a vital tool for a wide variety of applications. Software that aids the common user in performing routine computing chores have now become commonplace. With the Internet growing rapidly, numerous new sites are coming into existence each day. This necessarily means that a user has to spend more time and energy to search for a particular piece of information. The need of the day is to develop software that can act more like a human assistant understanding and learning a user’s behavior to emulate and aid him to carry out his task in a simpler and easier manner. Presented in this paper is one such architecture wherein agents inhabit the desktop, monitor user behavior and over a period of time learn to adapt and take over routine tasks. Embedded on the Microsoft Windows 2000 desktop, the agents in this architecture work co-operatively with one another to provide desktop management and intelligent web surfing support.   

 Prisoner's Dilemma Game on Network.    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.33-44 

 We study on the Prisoner's Dilemma game on network to clarify the influence of the network structures on agent strategies, and vice versa. A model is proposed to treat an interaction between the agent strategies and the network formation process. In case of a fixed network, it is observed that the distribution as well as the propagation speed of an agent strategy depends on the network structure. In an experiment combining the agent evolution and the network formation, a novel network that has a few agents connected by all of other agents appears.   

 Addressing Constraint Failures in Agent Interaction Protocol    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.45-59 

 The field of multi-agent systems shifts attention from one particular agent to a society of agents; hence the interactions between agents in the society become critical towards the achievement of their goals. We assume that the interactions are managed via an agent protocol which enables agents to coordinate their actions in order to handle the dependencies that exist between their activities. An agent’s failure to comply with the constraints attached within the protocol might cause a brittle protocol to fail. To address this problem, a constraint relaxation approach is applied using a distributed protocol language called the Lightweight Coordination Calculus (LCC). This paper describes the design and implementation of a constraint relaxation module to be integrated within the LCC framework. The working of this module is later illustrated using a scenario involving the ordering and configuration of a computer between the customer and vendor agents.   

 Reasoning about Success and Failure in Intentional Agents    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.60-72 

 Rational agents must be aware of their success and failure to truly assess their own progress towards their intended goals. In this study we describe a detailed investigation of how current BDI agents monitor their successes and failures during their reasoning cycle. Our analysis indicates that the existing architectures are inadequate to specifically detect failures in their own behaviors. This makes them unaware of the reality of the environment in which they are operating. We propose an extended BDI-like architecture to address these problems. We extend the current reasoning cycle by reformulating the execution of actions and plans, and introducing additional rules to detect failures. The resulting reformulation can be applied to existing systems such as JACK, JAM, etc. As a case study we extended JASON to implement the extended BDI architecture. Yes Yes   

 Agent-Base Workflow Management System Architecture – An Example on Conference Info System    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2009 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 
  pp.73-87 

 This study, taking reference of “Generic Workflow Production Structure, GWPS” proposed by WfMC and combining with design concepts of the Multi-Agent System, sets forth “Agent-Based Workflow Management System Architecture” and implements it onto the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) platform. Taking Conference Info System as an example, this study analyzes, designs and implements Agent-Based Conference Info System by the structure set forth in the study.   

 Diverse Applications of an Automated Argument System Based on the Logic of Multiple-Valued Argumentation    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jan 1970 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 
  pp.88-102 

 A Logic of Multiple-valued Argumentation (LMA) was formalized by Takahashi and Sawamura on an expressive knowledge representation language, Extended Annotated Logic Programming (EALP). LMA allows agents to construct arguments under uncertain knowledge and to argue with other agents on uncertain issues in the open networked heterogeneous environment. In this paper, we demonstrate its expressiveness and applicability through implementing it in a networked environment and applying it to diverse uncertain domains in which decision-making is sought in an argumentative way. We then show that it is the diversity of truth values in LMA that allows for an extensive applicability of it.   

 Dynamic Interaction Protocol Load in Multi-Agent System Collaboration

  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 
  pp.103-113 

 Multi-agent system(MAS) has more advantages because the agents can collaborate to complete complex tasks. However, the multi-agent interactions are more complex and even uncontrolled and it is difficult to resolve the multi-agent collaborations. This paper focuses on the interaction protocol in MAS. Firstly the interaction ontology library including role ontology, action ontology and message ontology is introduced into the semantic interactions. Then the representation of interaction protocol is presented which describes an interaction protocol as process description and decision-making rules. Then we propose a three-layer agent architecture that contains knowledge layer, collaboration control layer and communication layer. We embed a protocol interpreter and loader into the collaboration control layer to deal with the interactions between agents. Finally dynamic interaction protocol load in MAS are discussed, which load the interaction protocol from protocol library conveniently and the code will be generated automatically. To the end we give an experiment to verify our resolution.   

 Towards a Component-Based Architecture for TeleAgents    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.114-127 

 The component-based design of software systems has long been recognised in the realm of software engineering as a method for building highly adaptable and maintainable software systems. This paper explores the principles behind software agent-orientated frameworks and the component-based design of software agents. The ideas and principles discussed are then used in the introduction of our AgentAssembly framework and its application to the component-based construction of TeleAgents.   

 Development of a Lightweight Middleware Technologies Supporting Mobile Agents    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Jul 2009 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 
  pp.128-138 

 The mobile agent technology is considered to be very useful for ubiquitous environments. But in order to apply the mobile agent concept to ubiquitous devices, the mobile agent platform should be lightweight because the devices in ubiquitous environments have very limited computing resources. Normally, the ubiquitous devices have J2ME CLDC environments. But this environment has very limited functionality and does not support reflection, dynamic class loading, object serialization, and so on. Therefore it is very hard to develop the mobile agent platform over the standard J2ME CLDC environments. We have developed the lightweight mobile agent platform, called mMAP, for PDAs with J2ME CDC and have developed the proxy platform, called SAP, for the mobile phone with J2ME CLDC/MIDP. SAP manages the proxy agent, called shadow agent, which is created for each mobile agent in the mMAP. The cooperation between the two platforms allows us to control the mobile agents through the mobile phone.   

 The Roles of Active Perception in Intelligent Agent Systems    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers 
  pp.139-152 

 This paper discusses the need to incorporate the notion of active perception in intelligent agent systems. There are two justifications for this proposition. First, we believe perception should receive more attention and some special treatment. Perception is the most direct and effective way to update an agent’s beliefs about the status of its environment. In theory, an overwhelming portion of an agent’s decisions about its next course of action, or next actions, in either the reactive or deliberative model should be heavily influenced by what is happening in the environment – this is one of the important characteristics that differentiates agents from the traditional software design paradigm. An agent’s internal activities, such as deliberation and means-end analysis to a large extent, are also driven by what have been sensed. The second justification is that active perception plays an imperative role in situation awareness. Active perception is an important capability that directs an agent’s limited attention to the relevant aspects of the environment in an proactive manner.   

 Fairness in Cooperating Multi-agent Systems – Using Profit Sharing as an Example    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Sep 2005 
  Multi-Agent Systems for Society - 8th Pacific Rim International Workshop on Multi-Agents, PRIMA 2005, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 26-28, 2005, Revised Selected Papers

 Distributing profit in a coalition of multiple cooperating agents [3] is an important issue in both multi-agent and economics society. Proposed in 1953, Shapley value scheme with its elegant axiomatic derivation is essential to solution concepts for profit sharing. However, Shapley value scheme did not cover fairness issues. A new scheme of profit sharing with fairness awareness is proposed in this work. Axioms considering both fairness and efficiency issues are included in the new scheme. An algorithm is constructed for calculation of profit sharing under this new scheme. The existence of a solution existence and other properties of this algorithm are discussed.

 Many multi-agent interactions, like auctions and negotiations, can be modeled as games. Game theory is a tool to analyze these multi-agent applications as games and to analyze how agents should interact in these applications, which helps design intelligent agents. In many of the existing solutions to these multi-agent applications, the concept of risk is used, but it is not formally defined in game theory. On the other hand, in many games, pure strategy Nash equilibrium does not exist, while mixed or behavioral strategy equilibria are not appropriate, as mixed or behavioral strategies are probabilistic in nature, and it is possible that a low utility results in particular (sub)games. Worse, mixed or behavioral strategies cannot properly model the autonomous nature of agents. Furthermore, trigger strategies for repeated games are based on punishment, which is sometimes not as good as making decisions based on experience. However, making decisions based on past experience is not represented in existing game theory concepts. To solve the problems, we introduce the concept of risk strategies in repeated 2 ×2 risk games. We find that players can get better payoffs by using risk strategy than using mixed or behavioral strategies in repeated 2 ×2 risk games. In addition, we find that a game without pure strategy Nash equilibrium can converge to a new type of equilibrium which we define as risk strategy equilibrium.

 We describe a crowd model in emergency and panic situations. First, we describe the crowd structure of our model that comprises a combination of group-based and individual-based agents. This is followed by a description on the agent’s characteristics and its behaviours for emergency and panic situations. Detailed descriptions on agent’s behaviours including graphical illustrations and pseudo-scripts are also given. Finally, we summarize the paper and discuss the future work on the implementation of the crowd model for emergency and panic situations.

 Graphical utility models represent powerful formalisms for modeling complex agent decisions involving multiple issues [2]. In the context of negotiation, it has been shown [10] that using utility graphs enables reaching Pareto-efficient agreements with a limited number of negotiation steps, even for high-dimensional negotiations involving complex complementarity/ substitutability dependencies between multiple issues. This paper considerably extends the results of [10], by proposing a method for constructing the utility graphs of buyers automatically, based on previous negotiation data. Our method is based on techniques inspired from item-based collaborative filtering, used in online recommendation algorithms. Experimental results show that our approach is able to retrieve the structure of utility graphs online, with a high degree of accuracy, even for highly non-linear settings and even if a relatively small amount of data about concluded negotiations is available.   

 ARTISTE: Agent Organization Management System for Multi-Agent Systems

 An organizational information management system for multi-agent systems (MASs) on the Internet, called ARTISTE, is proposed. For an MAS to solve problems effectively, it is important to organize agents appropriately. Organizing agents adaptively on the Internet, however, is not easy, because the status of the Internet changes dynamically in a short time and no one can have a complete view of the whole network. The aims of ARTISTE are to form an agent organization in accordance with the current Internet and its problem-solving context and to provide organizational information for target MASs. ARTISTE operates as an independent system with respect to any MAS. To organize agents, ARTISTE collects information about agents’ abilities and statuses network information such as topologies, and a problem-dependent requirement from a target MAS. ARTISTE is designed as an MAS and it can collect the information about the network and the target MAS from multiple observation points. Furthermore, ARTISTE agents exchange their own local information in order to create a more global view of the network and the distribution of the agents. A prototype implementation of ARTISTE achieved sufficient performance to support deployment in the actual Internet environment.   

 Sensor Management Model Using Multi-agent in Small-Area Sensor Networks

  pp.222-230 

 In sensor networks, each sensor has very limited capability in battery life and processing power. This problem can be solved by employing a middleware system which can reduce the load of each sensor to expend the each sensor’s battery life and provide the proper control of the sensed data. In this paper, we propose a middleware model using multi-agent for small-area sensor networks. This model is focused on three functions such as data aggregation, network topology management, and sensor’s state control. With this model, the sensors need not to care of the data routing and the applications need not to care how the sensors are connected each other and how the necessary sensing data can be obtained. With this model, more flexible sensor based system can be constructed easily.   

 Conflict Resolution Method for Multi-context Situation

 In ubiquitous environment, each agent tires to aware the context. Usually, the context which agent tries to recognize, consists of different information. Even if several agents are in the same environment, each agent’s contexts are different. As every agent has different intention in the process of interaction with the environment, the view of each agent to the environment is different from others’ view. This difference in awareness of each agent can cause the conflict. As every agent behaves based on its own context, an agent’s action can interrupt other agent’s action. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for conflict management where several agents exist with different views for one situation. In this solution, two middleware agents are employed. One is the conflict manager which overlooks the whole situation and decides whether the requests of agents lead to the collision with existing requests. The other is the scheduler which selects which request should be performed according to the priority. With these middleware agents, the conflict can be effectively resolved by maximizing the usage of resources and minimizing the cancellation of requests.   

 Multi-auction Approach for Solving Task Allocation Problem

 Request for Proposal (RFP) problem is a type of task allocation problem where task managers need to recruit service provider agents to handle complex tasks composed of multiple sub-tasks, with the objective being to assign each sub-task to a capable agent while keeping the cost as low as possible. Most existing approaches either involve centralized algorithms or require each agent's cost for doing each sub-task to be known publicly beforehand, or attempt to force the agents to disclose such information by means of truth-telling mechanism, which is not practical in many problems where such information is sensitive and private. In this paper, we present an efficient multi-auction based mechanism that can produce near-optimal solutions without violating the privacy of the participating agents. By including an extra verification step after each bid, we can guarantee convergence to a solution while achieving optimal results in over 97% of the times in a series of experiment.

 Companion Modeling is a methodology used to facilitate adaptive management of renewable resources by their users. It is using role-playing games (RPG) and multiagent simulations to validate initial models representing the functioning of complex systems to be managed. In this research, we propose a novel agent model construction methodology in which classification learning is applied to the RPG log data in Companion Modeling. This methodology enables a systematic model construction that handles multi-parameters, independent of the modelers’ ability. There are three problems in applying classification learning to the RPG log data: 1) It is difficult to gather enough data for the number of features because the cost of gathering data is high. 2) Noise data can affect the learning results because the amount of data may be insufficient. 3) The learning results should be explained as a human decision making model and should be recognized by the expert as reflecting reality. We realized an agent model construction system using the following two approaches: 1) Using a feature selection method, the feature subset that has the best prediction accuracy is identified. In this process, the important features chosen by the expert are always included. 2) The expert eliminates irrelevant features from the learning results after evaluating the learning model through a visualization of the results. Finally, using the RPG log data from a Companion Modeling case study on rice production in northeastern Thailand, we confirm the capability of this methodology.   

 Modeling a MultiAgent Mobile Robotics Test Bed Using a Biologically Inspired Artificial Immune System    
   
 Conference Paper

  Multi-Agent Systems for Society 
  pp.270-283 

 The biological immune system is a complex, adaptive, pattern-recognition system that defends the body from foreign pathogens. The system uses learning, memory, and associative retrieval to solve recognition issues and classification of tasks. In particular, it learns to recognize relevant problems, remember those encountered in the past, and uses combinations to construct problem detectors efficiently. This paper explores an application of an adaptive learning mechanism for robots based on the natural immune system, using two algorithms, viz., the behavior arbitration mechanism and the clonal selection algorithm to demonstrate the innate and adaptive immune response respectively. The work highlights the innate and adaptive characteristics of the immune system, wherein a robot learns to detect vulnerable areas of a track and adapts to the required speed over such portions. A detailed study of the artificial immune metaphor is carried out and mapped onto the robot world. The robotics test bed comprised two Lego robots deployed simultaneously on two predefined near concentric tracks with the outer robot capable of helping the inner one when it misaligns. The inner robot raises an SOS signal on misalignment. The outer robot aids the inner robot to regain it alignment exhibiting the innate immunity. The adaptive system within the inner robot learns to tackle the problem in future using Clonal Selection mechanism.

 The limited description, discovery and integration mechanisms of current web service-based systems have many setbacks that hinder the extension and incorporation of dynamic capabilities into these systems. In this paper we present a novel software architecture called intelligent aspect-oriented web services (IAOWS) which addresses these problems and further improves on this technology by allowing for dynamic look-up and integration. IAOWS use a combination of Aspect-Oriented Multi-Agents and aspectual service descriptors for aspect-oriented web services to cater for more complete and thorough descriptions of services, thus supporting better dynamic discovery of both services and components, and their seamless integration and consumption by clients. We describe our IAOWS architecture and an initial implementation using .NET web services technology to engineer and deploy the Multi-Agents and capture the rich cross-cutting aspects together with their behavior and interaction within our highly distributed system.

 This paper extends XMDR[19] into G-XMDR (Global-Extended Metadata Registry) to ensure the interoperability of data, and to describe multi agent system using G-XMDR. The proposal G-XMDR will be solved the problem of data heterogeneity and inconsistency in sharing and exchanging each local data in virtual pervasive computing environments. Data heterogeneity is generated by different definition or mismatched expression of the same meaning data. Therefore, we define and design G-XMDR based on XMDR(ISO/IEC 11179) specification to interoperate various each local data in pervasive computing. We also describe our synchronizing multi agent system, which uses G-XMDR to solve data heterogeneity for data interoperability through synchronizing data. It provides more efficient agent through reducing errors that happened on synchronizing requests and adding new pervasive computing environments with their own each local data.

 Time plays a crucial role in describing dynamic domain and resources on the Web. Most of current ontology languages, without notion of time or change, can only describe domain knowledge in a static sense. In order to bring structure to time-varying information, we propose an interval-based knowledge model (IKM), which is composed of a temporal knowledge schema, temporal integrity constraints and an interpretation structure. In the IKM, a group of expressive temporal constructs are provided to capture the temporal features of concepts, attributes and relationships; a group of rules are defined to enrich expressivity of the model; formal meaning is given to the model via an interpretation with model-theoretical semantics. A high-level query language is defined on the model, too.

 A negotiation protocol is a specification of the rules that govern deliberation among negotiation agents. To model negotiation protocols formally is an important task in the designing of automated negotiation systems for electronic commerce. Lots of work has been done for negotiation modeling, but there still lacks a formalism for negotiation protocols of time-constrained multi-issue negotiation, which can be widely applied in electronic commerce. This paper proposes a modeling framework for time constrained multi-issue negotiation protocol. An extended Colored Petri Net model is proposed and used to represent the modeling framework formally. To illustrate the applicability of the extended Colored Petri Net model, an auction protocol with fixed number of bidders are modeled and the model’s characteristics are verified using the Petri Net verification tool HPSim.

 Longitudinal and persistent electronic medical record system is called EHR (Electronic Health Record) system. Many hospitals are trying to install EMR (Electronic Medical Record) system with slogan of paperless, chartless, filmless and slipless hospital. We propose an agent interaction messaging model to express the meaning of messages of ACL (Agent Communication Language) between agents that play key roles for Electronic Health Record System. Functional entities are divided according to tasks and implemented as collaborating agents.

 Problems of having different vocabularies pointed at the same terminology for health care parties are today’s issue. Communication problem of this kind in health information system around the globe are still without answers. By fast growing Intelligent Agent technology in the medical field, this issue becomes large enough to halt the progress. Agents for valid communication need to have same understanding over the terminology. Misunderstanding about meaning of a specific terminology by human is as same as misunderstandings of intelligent agents about meaning of a term-which concludes a fault communication-with the difference that agents are connected to each other and can exchange though at no time. The problem is where an agent can report for a valid knowledge base and correct meaning of a term. This paper is addressing this issue by presenting a Medical Vocabulary Interpreter as an Agent (We assume it to be a well known software, waiting to answer questions about original meaning of a terminology and ready to reply-first in first out service) to share a vast amount of complex information pointing to the same root.

 In this paper we propose dynamic description logic for formalizing multi-agent cooperation process with a clearly defined syntax and semantics. By combining the features of knowledge representation and reasoning of description logic and action theory for multi-agent interaction, our logic is effective and significant both for static and dynamic environment. On the static side, we employ description logic for the representation and reasoning of beliefs and goals. On the dynamic side, we adopt the object-oriented method to describe actions. The description of each action is composed of models, preconditions and effects. It can reflect the real changes of the world and is very suitable for belief revision and action planning. Based on our logic, we investigate how to form joint goal for multi-agent cooperation. In particular, we propose an effective dynamic planning algorithm for scheduling sub goals, which is greatly crucial for coordinating multi-agent behaviors.   

 Enhancing Bidding Strategies in CDAs by Adaptive Judgement of Price Acceptability

 Continuous Double Auctions (CDAs) and agent technology provide great opportunities for market institutions to carry out real-world trading quickly and conveniently. There are several bidding strategies in the literature for agents in CDAs to employ, which achieve good performance. However, almost all of these strategies do not judge whether a price is acceptable before they calculate their own asks or bids. Experiment results have demonstrated that the judgement of price acceptability can enhance the performance of agents. In order to enable agents to adopt the judgement of price acceptability in dynamic CDA markets, we propose an adaptive mechanism. The core of the adaptive mechanism is eagerness, which enables agents to explore the realtime supply and demand relationship and adjust the thresholds of price acceptability accordingly. Experiment results show that agents adopting the adaptive mechanism remarkably outperform the agents without the mechanism.   

 Dealing with Objectives in a Constraint-Based Extension to AgentSpeak(L)

 Incorporating constraints into a reactive BDI agent programming language can lead to better expressive capabilities as well as more efficient computation (in some instances). More interestingly, the use of constraint-based representations can make it possible to deal with explicit agent objectives (as distinct from agent goals) that express the things that an agent may seek to optimize at any given point in time. In this paper we extend the preliminary work of Ooi et.al [1] in augmenting the popular BDI language AgentSpeak(L)[4] with constraint-handling capabilities. We present a slightly modified version of their proposal, in the form of the language CAS (Constraint AgentSpeak). We then extend CAS to form the language CASO (Constraint AgentSpeak with Objectives) to incorporate explicit objectives (represented as objective functions) and present techniques for performing option selection (selecting the best plan to use to deal with the current event) as well as intention selection. In both cases, we present parametric look-ahead techniques, i.e., techniques where the extent of look-ahead style deliberation can be adjusted.

 Research on ontology is becoming increasingly widespread in the com-puter science community, and its importance is being recognized in a multiplicity of research fields and application areas, including knowledge engineering, database design and integration, information retrieval and extraction. We shall use the generic term “in-formation systems”, in its broadest sense, to collectively refer to these application per-spectives. We argue in this paper that so-called ontologies present their own methodo-logical and architectural peculiarities: on the methodological side, their main peculiar-ity is the adoption of a highly interdisciplinary approach, while on the architectural side the most interesting aspect is the centrality of the role they can play in an infor-mation system, leading to the perspective of ontology-driven information systems.

 Rice varieties and seed management involve a complex system dealing with various problems such as variety adoption, agro-biodiversity conservation, and quality seed supply. A participatory modeling experiment on rainfed lowland rice variety and seed management in lower northeast Thailand has been launched to better understand the system and its problems. Conceptual modeling was done through inter-institutional research team meetings, stakeholder analysis, surveying of stratified randomly sampled farmers and seed supply agents in Ubon Ratchathani Province, and by conceiving and using role-playing games (RPGs) with stakeholders. The system to be analyzed was divided into three subsystems, i.e. farmers' decision making regarding the choice of rice varieties, farmers' management of rice seeds, and the seed supply sub-system. A first RPG focusing on the first two subsystems was used with 25 farmers in two different gaming sessions. Observations and findings from the RPG helped to validate and to improve the conceptual model prepared by the research team. It also builds a shared understanding of farmers' rice varieties and seed management. Limited access to information about varieties and seeds, the need for early maturing varieties, and the scarcity of quality seeds were identified as current constraints of the system. A second RPG representing the seed supply subsystem is being conceived. Later on, a multi-agent system model of the whole system will also be developed and used to simulate scenarios identified by stakeholders and to discuss their results to facilitate collective learning and improvement of the current situation.

In this paper, we describe our recent work applying Aspect-Oriented Component Engineering (AOCE) to develop more adaptable, higher quality and more reusable software components for web services. We give examples on how AOCE can be used to design and implement Web Service- based systems, including aspect-oriented enhancements to the Web Services Description Language and the Universal Discovery, Description and Integration standards. We describe a prototype web services system we have implemented using AOCE to demonstrate and evaluate our technique.

 Intelligent Agents are being used for modelling simple rational behaviours in a wide range of distributed applications. In particular, multi-agent architectures based on the Belief-Desire- Intention model have been u sed successfully in situations where modelling of human reasoning and team behaviour are needed, such as simulating tactical decision-making in defence operations and command and control structures. Other applications include intelligent web applications, manufacturing control, telephone call centres, and air traffic management. The JACK Intelligent Agents™ framework by Agent Oriented Software brings the c oncept of intelligent agents into the mainstream of commercial software e ngineering and Java. JACK Intelligent Agents™ is a third generation agent framework, designed as a set of lightweight components with high performance and strong data typing. We present the design approach and major technical characteristics of JACK Intelligent Agents™, with a focus on some of the more recent developments - modular structuring elements called Capabilities and the team-based reasoning model called SimpleTeam. Two example applications, in decision support and defence simulation are described. Also, we discuss the benefits of the c omponent-based approach, both for the software engineer developing sophisticated distributed applications, and for the researcher exploring agent models and architectures.

 In the feature subset selection problem, a learning algorithm is faced with the problem of selecting a relevant subset of features upon which to focus its attention, while ignoring the rest. To a c hieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular training set, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training set interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach a n d s h o w a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a lter approach to feature subset selection. Signiicant improvement in accuracy is achieved for some datasets for the two families of induction algorithms used: decision trees and Naive-Bayes.

 Virtual sensors: Heterogeneous aggregation in pervasive networks

 Sensor networks are increasingly used to provide pervasive environments. These deployment environments entail embedded sensing devices that have limited pro- cessing, memory, and battery power. It is therefore essential to devise ecient ap- proaches that can collect low-level sensed data and transform it to a higher, more abstract measurement to relay to the user. This paper introduces the virtual sen- sors abstraction that enables an application developer to create software sensors that can apply user-specified functions on dierent types of data to provide a higher-level measurement that is not an intrinsic measurement provided by the physical sensors in the network. We evaluate our implementation of the virtual sensors model in two diverse example domains.

 Addressing Constraint Failures in Distributed Dialogue Protocols    
   
 Thesis    
 Jan 2003 

 Nardine Osman 
    
 Early agent communication languages lacked the means to coordinate the interaction between agents. The importance of coordination was better appreciated when open systems became in favor. Some solutions have been proposed; however, these normally rely on centralized gatekeepers. Distributed Dialogues, on the other hand, provide both communication and coordination protocols for multi-agent systems. They do that without the need to re-program agents every time they need to adapt to a new dialogue system and without the need for centralized gatekeepers for coordination. However, these dialogue protocols still aren’t tolerant to failure. When an agent does not respond appropriately, the dialogue simply stops. This usually happens when constraints are broken. This dissertation addresses these kinds of failure by offering ‘induced backtracking’ to explore other parts of the dialogue. It also proposes a negotiation protocol that could be used when some failed constraints are better dealt with by negotiation.

 Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation    
   
 Book    
 Jan 2005 

 R. Sun 
    
 This book explores the intersection between cognitive sciences and social sciences. In particular, it explores the intersection between individual cognitive modeling and modeling of multi-agent interaction (social stimulation). The two contributing fields - individual cognitive modeling (especially cognitive architectures) and modeling of multi-agent interaction (including social simulation and, to some extent, multi-agent systems) - have seen phenomenal growth in recent years. However, the interaction of these two fields has not been sufficiently developed. We believe that the interaction of the two may be more significant than either alone. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.

Users of COPCAs usually form groups to collaboratively perform their tasks using various computing devices, including desktop computers, pocket PCs, and/or smart phones, over Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET), LAN, and the Internet. These users usually share various types of data, including research ideas (documents), experimental and statistical data (numerical data, graphics, stream audio/video). A very important issue for sharing data in Collaborative Pervasive Computing Environments (COPCEs) is trustworthiness. To support trustworthy data sharing among groups of users of COPCAs, secure group communication, trustworthy shared data discovery, flexible access control mechanisms, effective data replication, data quality assurance mechanisms, and intrusion detection mechanisms are needed. In this chapter, the challenges, current state-of-the-art, and future research directions for trustworthy data sharing in COPCEs are presented. In particular, discussions will be focused on research issues and future research directions for trustworthy shared data discovery and flexible access control in service-based COPCAs.

 Immune system has powerful abilities such as memory, recognition and learning to respond to invaded antigens, and is expected to be applied to many industrial applications as well as neural networks. This paper proposes an algorithm imitating the immune system that is based on the somatic theory and the network hypothesis in order to make a plan for manufacturing systems. The former theory illustrates that somatic recombination and mutation contributes to increasing of the diversity of antibody. The others illustrates that mutual recognition network among the antibodies contributes to control of proliferation of clones. This paper shows that the proposed algorithm based on these theories is capable of searching for a global solution not but local solutions through a resource allocation problem.

 Mobile Agent Technology Enabling The Virtual Enterprise: A Pattern for Database Query    
   
 Article    

 Todd Papaioannou 
  John Edwards 
    
 The flexible integration of a range of disparate IT applications is a key requirement for today's global enterprises. The virtual enterprise, formed by a collection of collaborating companies for short term, high return, one off projects provides perhaps the most extreme example of this need. It is unlikely that any collaborators in a virtual enterprise will have similar networks or software, but the requirement exists for them to inter-operate. This paper proposes the notion that Mobile Agent Technology can be a significant aid to enterprise agility, particularly where distribution of information is a feature, as in virtual enterprises. The implications of using Java and its facilities for database connectivity (JDBC) together with mobile agent environments are discussed before a model to fulfil the requirements of the manufacturing Sales/Order process is proposed. The model used in the process has been produced with data collected from an industrial case study. The subsequent decomposition of the Agent types involved reveals an abstract pattern for database query using agent technology. Finally, the tools required by an enterprise wishing to utilise agent technology are discussed.

 To share and standardize information, especially in the database environments, MDR (Metadata Registry) can be used to integrate various heterogeneous databases within a particular domain. But due to the discrepancies of data element representation between organizations, global information integration is not so easy. And users who are searching integrated information on the Web have limitation to obtain schema information for the underlying source databases. To solve those problems, in this paper, we present a 3-layered Information Integration System (LI2S) based on MDRs and Ontology. The purpose of proposed architecture is to define information integration model, which combine both of the nature of MDRs standard specification and functionality of ontology for the concept and relation. Adopting agent technology to the proposed model plays a key role to support the hierarchical and independent information integration architecture. Ontology is used as for a role of semantic network from which it extracts concept from the user query and the establishment of relationship between MDRs for the data element. (MDR and Knowledge Base are used as for the solution of discrepancies of data element representation between MDRs. Based on this architectural concept, LI2S was designed and implemented.

 The ability to describe, locate, choose, and interact with services is an integral part of pervasive computing. Compared to previous computing environments, pervasive computing environments are more dynamic and transient while services and clients in these environments are diverse in type and function. In order to effectively facilitate communication and computation in these environments, protocols must be able to these characteristics. This work concentrates on our approach to two of the four components of service discovery, service description and dissemination. We introduce and compare the performance of our schemes to that of existing industrial and research approaches.

 This study provides an empirical evaluation of the effects of an enhanced predictive display concept for air traffic control. The predictive display informed the controller of the targeted altitude or heading of aircraft in a transitionary state The information provided simulated that which could be produced by a datalink from the aircraft's flight management system in a future air traffic system operation. The pilots in the simulation operated under self-separation rules and did not request clearances for altered flight plans. Use of the predictive display resulted in improvements in some air traffic control performance and situation awareness measures. Based on the results of the study, we recommend making improvements to the predictive display to better integrate it with the controller's radar display.

 Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a merger of two declarative paradigms: constraint solving and logic programming. Although a relatively new field, CLP has progressed in several quite different directions. In particular, the early fundamental concepts have been adapted to better serve in different areas of applications. In this survey of CLP, a primary goal is to give a systematic description of the major trends in terms of common fundamental concepts. The three main parts cover the theory, implementation issues, and programming for applications.

 This short paper outlines research that the Universities of Arizona and New Mexico have initiated in distributed robotics. A basic hypothesis of this research is that intrinsically efficient discrete event abstractions of soft computing paradigms, including neurons and fuzzy rule controllers, will enable cooperative multi-robot systems to overcome severe limitations on on- board processing and communications networking. Specifically, we seek to implement fast reacting agent architectures capable of identificatio n and neutralizations of non-self invaders. Implications in general for the tradeoffs between local computation, communication and ability to cooperatively self-organize are discussed. 1

 Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a novel evolutionary paradigm inspired by the biological aspects of the immune system. The human immune system has motivated scientists and engineers for finding powerful information processing algorithms that has solved complex engineering tasks. This paper discusses two concepts. (a) The behavioral management of artificial intelligence (AI) namely the intelligent multi agent systems, (b) The evolutionary computation called the artificial immune system that imitates the biological theory called the immune system. The outcome of this research is an Artificial Immune System based Intelligent Multi Agent Model named AISIMAM that solves agent-based applications. The model is applied to a mine detection and diffusion problem and the results prove that AISIMAM has solved the problem successfully.

 Abstract In this paper we propose a logic-based social approach to the specification and verification of agent interaction. We firstly introduce integrity constraints about social acts (called Social Integrity Constraints) as a formalism to express interaction protocols and to give a social semantics to the behavior of agents, focusing on communicative acts. Then, we discuss several possible kinds of verification of agent interaction, and we show how social integrity constraints can be used to verify some properties in this respect. We focus our attention on static verification of compliance of agent specifications to interaction protocols, and on run-time verification, based on agents'observable behavior. We adopt as a running example the NetBill security transaction protocol for the selling and delivery of information goods.

 Bilateral Multi-Issue Contract Negotiation for Task Redistribution Using a Mediation Service    
   
 Article    
 Jan 2004 

 Raymund Lin 
    
 Research areas related to bilateral multi-issue negotiation problems include dealing with two-sided uncertainty, handling inter-dependent issues and determining rational negotiation strategies. Using a task-redistribution scenario, this study presents a mediation technique that can overcome most of these dif- ficulties. Agents in this mediation process can identify win-win solutions given two-sided uncertainty and inter-dependent issues. Furthermore, the negotiation strategy applied by agents is shown to be in game-theoretic equilibrium. Since no Prisoner's Dilemma is presented in the mediation game, the proposed mediation mechanism is ideal for mediating one-off negotiations.

  School-based assessment is a new policy venture in the highly centralised education system of Malaysia. One area that has been subjected to this change initiative is the Oral English Assessment (OEA). A qualitative study was conducted to explore teacher perspectives of the implementation of school-based OEA among the Form 1 (Year 7) students in a secondary school. Semi-structured interviews were ... [Show full abstract]  conducted on two English Language teachers and their oral English assessment sessions were observed. Data were coded, clustered, and categorized into themes. Analysis indicated that both teachers generally agreed that school-based assessment is the way forward in assessment provided the fundamentals are in place. Issues such as grading guidelines and implementation procedures must be ironed out before successful implementation can happen. Cross-case analysis revealed three major themes: insufficient guidelines on the implementation process, lack of teachers’ knowledge base, and lack of external monitoring of school-based OEA. The inherent implication of the themes is that greater attention is required in the implementation of educational policies with effective alignment of the relevant tools.

This argument-based negotiation among agents has much to gain from the use of Extended Logic Programming and Incomplete Information, in terms of the argument's evaluation. Indeed, it is based on this substratum that are presented the bases for a pre-contract negotiation via argumentation, where pre-contract negotiation will be defined as a protocol which, once enforced, will allow the exchange of messages containing proposals, counter-proposals, critiques, justifications or even explanations. The terms of a negotiation are also set, adjusting the contract according to the agent's knowledge base. In fact, an important contribution of this work relies on the presentation of the basic definitions and the general model of pre-contract-based negotiations via argumentation.

It provides full support for the management of the usual teaching tasks in a traditional school: Student and teacher registration, creation and management of classes and test papers, individualized assignment of exercises, intelligent step by step guidance in solving ... [Show full abstract]  exercises, student interaction recording, skill mastery statistics and student assessment. The intelligence of the system lies in its Algebra Tutor, a model-tracing tutor developed within the MATHESIS project, that teaches a breadth of 16 top-level math skills (algebraic operations): monomial multiplication, division and power, monomial-polynomial and polynomial-polynomial multiplication, parentheses elimination, collect like terms, identities (square of sum and difference, product of sum by difference, cube of sum and difference), factoring (common factor, term grouping, identities, quadratic form). These skills are further decomposed in simpler ones giving a deep domain expertise model of 104 primitive skills. The tutor has two novel features: a) it exhibits intelligent task recognition by identifying all skills present in any expression through intelligent parsing, and b) for each identified skill, the tutor traces all the sub-skills, a feature we call deep model tracing. Furthermore, based on these features, the tutor achieves broad knowledge monitoring by recording student performance for all skills present in any expression. Forty teachers who evaluated the system in a 3-hours workshop appreciated the fine-grained step-by-step guidance of the student, the equally fine grained student model created by the tutor and its ability to tutor any exercise that contains the aforementioned math skills. The system was also used in a real junior high school classroom with 20 students for three months. Evaluation of the students’ performance in the domain of factoring gave positive learning results.

  Over the past decade, Malaysia has enjoyed tremendous growth in its economy. This has brought about a population growth along with a great influx of foreign workforce to cities. This resulted in an increase in the amount of waste scheduled generated. Furthermore, scheduled waste management has long been a problem area for local authorities in Kuala Lumpur. Continued illegal dumping by waste ... [Show full abstract]  generators is being practiced at large scale due to lack of proper guidance and awareness. This report reviewed and discussed about service provided for scheduled waste management by an authority and international scenario of scheduled waste management. An expert system was developed to integrate scheduled waste management in Kuala Lumpur. The knowledge base was acquired through journals, books, magazines, annual report, and web sites. An object oriented expert system shell, Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition was used as the building tools for the prototype development.

 Strategies and Challenges in Cloud-to-Cloud Migration Using Infrastructure as Code  
  Abstract   
 As the landscape of cloud computing continues to transform at a rapid pace, organizations seek to optimize operational costs, enhance system flexibility, and adjust to changing market demands. This paper reports a case study within a Finnish startup operating in self-service mobile payment systems. It provides a detailed analysis of migrating an application architecture from DigitalOcean to AWS (Amazon Web Services) using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), providing insights into the strategies, challenges, and outcomes of the process. The key findings suggest that while cloud migration involves considerable technical and operational challenges, the utilization of IaC (Infrastructure as Code) can significantly mitigate these obstacles, enhancing the speed, reliability, and security of the migration process. This research contributes to the limited literature on cloud-to-cloud migration, highlighting the effective use of IaC to facilitate transitions between cloud environments.

 Benchmarking Ongoing Development Output in Real-Life Software Projects  
  Abstract   
 In this case study we compare six different metrics and their suitability for productivity benchmarking on development output level. We use detailed data from four software industry projects performed by one company with overall 264 months of development and 1.1 million source lines of code. Code change, absolute growth and number of commits as well as invested effort are measured in consecutive 3-month periods. This allows us to observe alterations in productivity throughout the course of a project as well as inter-project comparisons. We find correlations between effort and the chosen output metrics as well as significant and explainable productivity differences between projects and project phases.   
 We also analyze whether the use of a clone detection algorithm can improve measurement by adjusting for copy & paste additions and renamed or moved code, and find that a small benefit exists. The redundancy-adjusted amount of code tokens added or modified seems to be the best metric among the selected, in particular in ongoing development where an already existing codebase is changed. Number of commits and absolute growth may complement the picture.

 A Multi-model Approach for Video Data Retrieval in Autonomous Vehicle Development  
  Abstract   
 Autonomous driving software generates enormous amounts of data every second, which software development organizations save for future analysis and testing in the form of logs. However, given the vast size of this data, locating specific scenarios within a collection of vehicle logs can be challenging. Writing the correct SQL queries to find these scenarios requires engineers to have a strong background in SQL and the specific databases in question, further complicating the search process. This paper presents and evaluates a pipeline that allows searching for specific scenarios in log collections using natural language descriptions instead of SQL. The generated descriptions were evaluated by engineers working with vehicle logs at the Zenseact on a scale from 1 to 5. Our approach achieved a mean score of 3.3, demonstrating the potential of using a multi-model architecture to improve the software development workflow. We also present an interface that can visualize the query process and visualize the results.

 AI-Based Automotive Test Case Generation: An Action Research Study on Integration of Generative AI into Test Automation Frameworks  
  Abstract   
 Generative AI is transforming software development, particularly in unit and regression testing. However, it’s rarely used in Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing due to hardware-specific environments. This paper examines integrating GitHub Copilot into automotive test automation frameworks, focusing on Volvo’s Test Automation Framework (TAF). It explores how Copilot can automate test case generation and compares AI-generated test cases with manually written ones in terms of reliability and robustness. Using an iterative action research methodology, the study evaluates the functional suitability of AI-generated test cases and the challenges of integration. Results show that in the first iteration, 23% of AI-generated test cases passed in Jenkins and received high functionality scores. In the second iteration, this increased to 36%. These findings highlight the potential of Generative AI to enhance HIL testing.

 AI Act High-Risk Requirements Readiness: Industrial Perspectives and Case Company Insights  
  Abstract   
 The AI Act’s (AIA) requirements for high-risk AI systems affect many aspects of modern software systems. Knowing which AIA-related technical challenges are relevant to different companies is essential to focus compliance-oriented research on the aspects that matter. We therefore conducted an interview study in collaboration with a case company that specializes in network video solutions within the security and surveillance industry. External experts enrich the study for a broader industry perspective. The goal was to analyze the case company’s readiness for the AIA’s high-risk requirements, based on methods and techniques already established prior to the legislation. Our results yielded a positive sentiment towards the regulation and the planning security that it brings, although a high workload was expected. We identified a solid foundation with well-established practices to build upon for the requirements on cybersecurity  , human oversight  , record-keeping  , and technical documentation  . However, we also report several open challenges, mainly connected to the requirement on data quality and governance  , followed by accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity  . The AIA specifically demands a post-market monitoring system  (Art 72) and the right to an explanation of individual decision-making  (Art 86). These two obligations were identified as especially challenging by the respondents. The result of this study is expected to steer future compliance-oriented work toward pressing challenges.

 Adopting Continuous Deployment in a Public Administration Project: An Industrial Case Study  
  Abstract   
 Continuous deployment is a significant trend in software development, yet its adoption and potential benefits within the public sector remain under-researched. This paper examines a case study of continuous deployment implementation in a public sector project undertaken by Solita, a software development company, for a client utilizing agile methodologies. The study provides a comprehensive overview of the motivations, benefits, and challenges encountered during continuous deployment adoption. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on continuous deployment by providing valuable insights into its application within the public sector context, offering practical recommendations for overcoming challenges and achieving successful implementation.

 An Automated Approach to Identify Source Code Files Affected by Architectural Technical Debt  
  Abstract   
 Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) is a persistent challenge in software development, often hindered by the absence of comprehensive architectural documentation. This research presents an automated approach to detect source code files indicative of ATD within a version control system. By analyzing code metrics, change history, and architectural smells, we identify files exhibiting signs of increasing complexity and maintenance effort. Our method was applied to the Apache Cassandra repository and validated through interviews with Ericsson developers. Results indicate a strong correlation between files with specific architectural smells, frequent modifications, and growing complexity, and the presence of ATD. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using source code analysis to systematically identify potential architectural issues, aiding developers in prioritizing refactoring efforts and improving software quality.

 On the Derivation of Quality Assurance Plans from Process Model Descriptions  
  Abstract   
 In domains such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices, high-quality software is key due to the critical nature of these applications and the low margin for failure. Ensuring the quality of software is essential to prevent potentially catastrophic outcomes. In this paper, we present an approach to derive quality assurance plans from well-defined process models. Utilizing the GQM model, we derive quality requirements and metrics based on a process example, which we realize in the process management tool Stages. Based on the exemplary realization, we simulate 100 projects to provide data used in a recommendation system that enriches the process model such that quality assurance plans including the metrics of interest can be generated from the process model. Our findings show that, given sufficient data is available, context-specific quality assurance plans can be generated and which particular steps have to be taken to realize the overall concept in the studied tool.

 Evaluating AI-Based Code Segmentation for ABAP Programs in an Industrial Use Case  
  Abstract   
 Many maintenance and evolution tasks in software engineering depend on the availability of logical code segments, especially AI- and data-driven approaches rely on segmented source code. In order to obtain logical segments a manual step is typically necessary. However, manual segmentation requires a basic understanding of the source code and delays the application of code analysis and refactoring tools. Automatic code segmentation provides an efficient way of extracting code snippets for further analysis to provide developers with actionable insights on software products and processes. Rule-based approaches rely on syntactic boundaries and lack the applicability of segmentation on multiple languages. In this article, we present our approach to learning logical code snippets using a BiLSTM neural network model. Driven by the requirements of an industrial use case, we train two models, one on the programming languages Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and Ruby, the other model is additionally trained on ABAP (“Advanced Business Application Programming”) snippets. To evaluate the performance of the models, we use real-world samples used in the SAP applications of our industry partner. We also compare the predictions of the model, with an accuracy >98%, to the results of human experts for segmenting ABAP code to evaluate whether AI-based code segmentation is perceived as effective by practitioners in our industrial use case. The study shows that only 42–51% of the predicted ABAP code snippets match the manual segmentation of the experts.

 Quantum Algorithms: Application and Feasibility  
  Abstract   
 In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of quantum algorithms for practical applications and categorize them into three types: green, yellow, and red. Green means the most feasible, while red means the least feasible. We select four quantum algorithms from the Algebraic and Number Theoretic fields, four from the Optimization field, six from the Machine Learning field, and four from the Oracular field to assess their feasibility. Our results show that some quantum algorithms can be applied to solve real-life problems in the near future, while other fields may take a long time to be practically applied. The feasibility assessment is obtained by considering whether there are requirements in the quantum algorithms that are hard to satisfy with current quantum technologies and predicting how much time it will require for those requirements to be satisfied in the future. We also provide a table summarizing the feasibility evaluation results of these quantum algorithms.

 Towards Solving Short-Term Generation Scheduling Problems on Quantum Computers  
  Abstract   
 Identifying possible use cases for quantum computers is important to evaluate the potential. This work-in-progress paper explores their potential for addressing the short-term generation scheduling (STGS) problem in hydropower plants. By working towards reformulating the STGS problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, we aim to leverage the capabilities of quantum computers to find optimal solutions. Initial results using piecewise linear approximation indicate promising outcomes. Further research will focus on the QUBO formulation, implementing the approach on quantum hardware, and assessing its performance.

 Generating and Evolving Real-Life Like Synthetic Data for e-Government Services Without Using Real-World Raw Data  
  Abstract   
 Testing of applications that use data from e-Government services as input requires test data that is real-life like but where the privacy of personal information is guaranteed. Many approaches exist for creating high-quality synthetic test data, but most of them need real-life raw data as input. Our research aims to develop and evaluate an approach for generating and evolving real-life like synthetic test data without using real-world raw data. The expected benefit of our research is to enable the creation and evolvement of meaningful and real-life like synthetic test data in situations where real-life raw data is not accessible due to privacy reasons.

 A Data-Driven Approach to Optimize Internal Software Quality and Customer Value Delivery  
  Abstract   
 The growing complexity, the ever-ending demands for new features, and the need to become faster to remain competitive force software development organizations to rethink their development and value delivery practices. While continuous delivery has become more popular, it still relies mainly on internal metrics, ad-hoc data, and expert opinions. As a result, software organizations stumble to find the balance between improving internal system quality and delivering external value. In fact, understanding and measuring customer value is on itself essential. In this PhD project, we aim for a better understanding of customer value and develop measurement instruments to be integrated with internal perspectives to drive proactive and continuous internal improvement while delivering relevant customer value.

 PRO-VE 2022 Explores Collaborative Networks in Digitalization and Society 5.0  

 Previous  Next    
 PRO-VE 2022 Explores Collaborative Networks in Digitalization and Society 5.0  
  PRO-VE 2022   – the 23rd IFIP/SOCOLNET Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises – was held from 19-21 September in Lisbon, Portugal and sponsored by IFIP Working Group 5.5.   
 Although initially planned as a hybrid event due to COVID uncertainties, PRO-VE 2022 ended up being run primarily as a physical event, attracting almost 90 participants. This provided great opportunities for face-to-face interactions, discussions, and exchange of experiences.   
 Three excellent keynotes enriched the program:   
 Cognitive Digital Twins: connecting the dots of Closed-Loop Lifecycle Management, by Dimitris Kyritsis, EPFL, Switzerland 
  Collaborative Potential of AI and Human Ingenuity in Co-creating Value in Society 5.0, by Massimiliano Luca Dragoni, European Commission 
  Is resilience enough? Collaborative Networks towards antifragility, by Salvatore Ammirato, University of Calabria, Italy 
  The event also included 55 technical papers, three panels and one hands-on tutorial.   
   
 The main theme of the conference was  Collaborative Networks in Digitalization and Society 5.0  . “Digitalization” represents a major ongoing transformation in industry and services where the adoption and integration of a large variety of novel information and communication technologies leads to more efficient, flexible, agile, and sustainable systems. Digitalization became one of the key aspects of Industry 4.0. Current trends towards  Industry 5.0  introduce a complementary view, targeting a sustainable, human-centric, and resilient industry. The notion of  Society 5.0  represents an even more comprehensive strategy on science, technology and innovation aiming a people-centric super-smart society.   
   
 As demonstrated in recent editions of PRO-VE, collaborative networks play a central role in these transformative processes. In fact, such ambitious goals can only be achieved through collaboration among multiple stakeholders, collaboration among intelligent / autonomous systems, and collaboration among human and systems.   
 PRO-VE 2022 was an active forum for sharing and discussing current developments and experiences regarding the role of collaborative networks in digitalization as well as identifying and discussing challenges ahead towards a collaborative Society 5.0.   
 The conference explored a wide array of topics, clustered along the following themes:   
 Digitalization in Collaborative Networks 
  Digital Twins in Industry 
  Digital Transformation Through the Lens of Sociotechnical Systems 
  Collaborative Business Models and Digitalization 
  Service Design for Society 5.0 and Industry 5.0 
  Architectures for Collaborative Enterprise Integration 
  AI Application in Collaborative Networks 
  Dynamic Interplay of Humans and AI in Collaborative Networks 
  AI and Digital Tools for Collaborative Healthcare Networks 5.0 
  Contribution of Digital Transformation to Sustainable Supply Chains 
  Agile and Responsive Supply Chains 
  Risk and Resilience in Collaborative Networks 
  A Path Forward Towards the Green D 
  Shaping Values Through Collaborative Work 
  Value Co-Creation in Ecosystems 
  Sociotechnical Strategies in Collaborative Systems 
  Proceedings were published by Springer, under the IFIP AICT series.

  Earth Friendly Computation: Applying Indigenous Data Lifecycles in Medical and Sovereign AI   
 Session Chairs: Keolu Fox, Krystal Tsosie, Kaja Wasik, Alec Calac, Alexander Ioannidis, Eric T. Dawson    
 The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) across fields - particularly with the advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) and the application of AI in human health - is generating vast quantities of data, consuming massive amounts of energy, and leaving behind significant environmental footprints. This growth poses a potential risk of exacerbating the climate crisis, which may, in turn, have major downstream impacts on global health.  
   
  This session will focus on the innovative integration of Indigenous data lifecycle models that respect the principles of data as a sacred entity and relation, with the growing field of medical AI, particularly in precision medicine and public health. We aim to foster a dialogue on how computational methods, rooted in Indigenous wisdom, can not only enhance the accuracy and fairness of AI in healthcare and other fields but also promote the conservation of environmental resources in computational practices.

  Precision Medicine: Multi-modal and multi-scale methods to promote mechanistic understanding of disease   
 Session Chairs: Yana Bromberg, Steven Brenner, Hannah Carter    
 Technological advances in high-throughput omics technologies have made it possible to develop a new class of biomarkers that predict patient drug responses, susceptibility to diseases, and other medical outcomes. Toward the goal of precision medicine, methodological advances are needed to translate such biomarkers to the clinic as well as provide mechanistic insight as to their clinical utility. We welcome all submissions relevant to this exciting and growing area of research.

  Overcoming health disparities in precision medicine   
 Session Chairs: Kathleen Barnes, Harris Bland, Francisco De La Vega, Todd L. Edwards, Keolu Fox, Alexander Ioannidis, Eimear Kenny, Rasika Mattias, Bogdan Pasaniuc, Jada Benn Torres, Digna R Velez Edwards,    
 This session seeks to advance computations methods and data science approaches to overcome disparities in precision medicine and public health by addressing racial, ethnic, and gender disparities across biomedical research, patient, provider, and health system levels, which are influenced by a mix of social, psychosocial, lifestyle, environmental, and biological factors. This year's emphasis will include intersectional research approaches that examine how various social identities and categories—like race, gender, class, sexuality, age, ability, and ethnicity—interact to shape individual experiences in healthcare and systemic inequalities. Emphasizing the role of 'Big Data' and the Electronic Health Record, the session will discuss challenges in computational approaches to intersectionality, particularly the capture and analysis of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and environmental risk factors. Strategies being developed to address these challenges include enhanced data collection through large population-based cohorts, multi-pronged approaches within large EHR populations, and advanced geocoding to assess environmental impacts in conjunction with clinical data. These efforts are essential to overcoming existing limitations in capturing complex and dynamic information such as transgender health issues, where traditional data collection methods fall short.

 In a wave of disruptive technology, large language model chatbots are giving access to interactive systems capable of surpassing humans in clinical reasoning, while generative image models blur the distinction between fabricated vs. real information and intelligence. This session will showcase cutting edge research invoking such methods to enhance patient care through clinical decision support, monitoring tools, image interpretation, and triaging capabilities, even as in-depth studies are needed to assess the impact and implications of such systems on human lives.

  Earth Friendly Computation: Applying Indigenous Data Lifecycles in Medical and Sovereign AI   
 Session Chairs: Keolu Fox, Krystal Tsosie, Kaja Wasik, Alec Calac, Alexander Ioannidis, Eric T. Dawson    
 The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) across fields - particularly with the advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) and the application of AI in human health - is generating vast quantities of data, consuming massive amounts of energy, and leaving behind significant environmental footprints. This growth poses a potential risk of exacerbating the climate crisis, which may, in turn, have major downstream impacts on global health.  
   
  This session will focus on the innovative integration of Indigenous data lifecycle models that respect the principles of data as a sacred entity and relation, with the growing field of medical AI, particularly in precision medicine and public health. We aim to foster a dialogue on how computational methods, rooted in Indigenous wisdom, can not only enhance the accuracy and fairness of AI in healthcare and other fields but also promote the conservation of environmental resources in computational practices.

  Precision Medicine: Multi-modal and multi-scale methods to promote mechanistic understanding of disease   
 Session Chairs: Yana Bromberg, Steven Brenner, Hannah Carter    
 Technological advances in high-throughput omics technologies have made it possible to develop a new class of biomarkers that predict patient drug responses, susceptibility to diseases, and other medical outcomes. Toward the goal of precision medicine, methodological advances are needed to translate such biomarkers to the clinic as well as provide mechanistic insight as to their clinical utility. We welcome all submissions relevant to this exciting and growing area of research.

  Overcoming health disparities in precision medicine   
 Session Chairs: Kathleen Barnes, Harris Bland, Francisco De La Vega, Todd L. Edwards, Keolu Fox, Alexander Ioannidis, Eimear Kenny, Rasika Mattias, Bogdan Pasaniuc, Jada Benn Torres, Digna R Velez Edwards,    
 This session seeks to advance computations methods and data science approaches to overcome disparities in precision medicine and public health by addressing racial, ethnic, and gender disparities across biomedical research, patient, provider, and health system levels, which are influenced by a mix of social, psychosocial, lifestyle, environmental, and biological factors. This year's emphasis will include intersectional research approaches that examine how various social identities and categories—like race, gender, class, sexuality, age, ability, and ethnicity—interact to shape individual experiences in healthcare and systemic inequalities. Emphasizing the role of 'Big Data' and the Electronic Health Record, the session will discuss challenges in computational approaches to intersectionality, particularly the capture and analysis of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and environmental risk factors. Strategies being developed to address these challenges include enhanced data collection through large population-based cohorts, multi-pronged approaches within large EHR populations, and advanced geocoding to assess environmental impacts in conjunction with clinical data. These efforts are essential to overcoming existing limitations in capturing complex and dynamic information such as transgender health issues, where traditional data collection methods fall short.

Since the bookmark and history functions only the title and URL of the Web page, users who cannot remember the contents of each Web page have difficulty retracing their steps. In this paper, we propose a bookmark system based on a 3D interface. Additionally, our system offers three main functions  
  a 3D browsing history function, a marker function, and a look-ahead loading function. These functions enable users to browse Web pages more effectively.

 PSC 2024 is the 27 th  Stringology conference. It is an international conference focusing on stringology and related areas. It is organized annually by the Prague Stringology Club  , a research group in the Department of Theoretical Computer Science  at the Faculty of Information Technology  , Czech Technical University in Prague  . The proceedings of recent conferences are indexed in DBLP  , Scopus  , and Web of Science  of Clarivate  .  
 Stringology is a part of algorithmic research that deals with the processing of text strings. It has existed for at least thirty years and developed into a respected subfield of its own. The last twenty years have produced an explosion of new results. This progress is due in part to the human genome effort, an area to which string algorithms can make important contributions. String processing extended into tree processing is called arbology.  
 The topics of the conference include but are not limited to: algorithms for pattern matching in strings, images and trees 
  data structures (automata, trees etc.) for pattern matching in strings, images and trees 
  coding and data compression 
  bioinformatics 
  information retrieval 
  string processing algorithms in databases 
  searching for regularities 
  natural language processing

 PSC 2024 is the 27 th  Stringology conference. It is an international conference focusing on stringology and related areas. It is organized annually by the Prague Stringology Club  , a research group in the Department of Theoretical Computer Science  at the Faculty of Information Technology  , Czech Technical University in Prague  . The proceedings of recent conferences are indexed in DBLP  , Scopus  , and Web of Science  of Clarivate  .  
 Stringology is a part of algorithmic research that deals with the processing of text strings. It has existed for at least thirty years and developed into a respected subfield of its own. The last twenty years have produced an explosion of new results. This progress is due in part to the human genome effort, an area to which string algorithms can make important contributions. String processing extended into tree processing is called arbology.  
 The topics of the conference include but are not limited to: algorithms for pattern matching in strings, images and trees 
  data structures (automata, trees etc.) for pattern matching in strings, images and trees 
  coding and data compression 
  bioinformatics 
  information retrieval 
  string processing algorithms in databases 
  searching for regularities 
  natural language processing

  Speech Abstract:  Video in the form of image sequences, which lose the temporal process of the photons flow, leads to an irreconcilable dilemma between high-dynamic and high-speed imaging. Based on the fact that the pixels of the photoelectric sensor are indepen⁃ dent, a new continuous photographing principle is invented: for each pixel, accumulate charge from the reset state, generate a spike as a flag once the specified threshold is reached, reset and repeat. The duration that a spike takes to be fired is called its spiking width, which is inversely proportional to the light intensity during this period. Based on this, the light intensity during this period can be estimated. The array of the spike sequences of all pixels is so-called “viform”, which contains rich spatial and temporal information of the light process. A n image at any moment can be calculated from viform, thereby ultrahigh-speed, high-dynamic and non-blurred continuous im⁃ aging achieved.Employing mature CMOS photonic devices and standard processes, two spike continuous photographing chips and spike cameras with spatial resolutions of 0.1 million and 1 million pixels have been developed, respectively. Viform will fundamentally reshapes computer vision and visual information processing technology and industries. An open source algorithm framework, SpikeCV, achieves high-speed target detection, tracking, and recognition system that is faster than the human eye by thousands of times, with low computational complexity.

  Speech Abstract:  Machine Unlearning.  
  Big data has been one of the important enablers of the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence. Its use for training machine learning models has enabled many useful applications. However, there are also some downsides when the data contains sensitive, often personal, information. Recent privacy and data protection regulations across the world have recognized the “right to be forgotten” as a fundamental right of citizens. Enabling this in practice not only requires deletion of data from institutional databases but also necessitates deletion of data from trained machine learning models. Machine Unlearning refers to the process of selectively removing or forgetting some specific data or a class of data from a machine learning (often deep learning) model. This talk will introduce the emerging field of machine unlearning, discuss the motivations behind it, the techniques employed, and its implications for data privacy, fairness, and interpretability. We will present several approaches for unlearning, including the selective modification of model parameters, regularization techniques, data-free methods, and teacher-student frameworks. We will then discuss the challenges and open research questions in the field. Machine Unlearning can thus be seen to contribute towards building more accountable AI systems that can engender trust among users and stakeholders.

  Speech Abstract:  See the unseen – we cannot automate what we cannot see in agriculture and aquaculture.  
  The recent explosion of AI/ML/Vision algorithm accuracy, efficiency and low processing cost has suddenly enabled applications undreamt of even five years ago – especially for challenging outdoor agritech applications. Our research is interested in these real-world applications, such as rapid data reduction of petabytes of data from scanning a farm (such as orchards or vineyards) from sub-mm under-canopy/underwater proximal sensing. We cannot automate what we cannot see – so our recent breakthroughs with NeRF and Gaussian splatting is helping to solve leaf occlusion to enable a rapid uptake of agricultural automation. I will describe our contributions across these research areas, including recent autonomous systems research into drones pruning forests, robots pruning vineyards, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) inspecting mussel lines to detect invasive biofouling species and AUVs mapping the seabed to locate scallops. We will also discuss the challenges that remain and so propose potential directions for future work.

  Submission Guidelines  
 High-quality papers in all PST-related areas that, at the time of submission, are not under review and have not already been published or accepted for publication elsewhere are solicited. Authors MUST ensure to select the track (Privacy, Security, or Trust) most relevant to their research when submitting their paper. Accepted papers will be accepted as ‘regular’ papers up to 10 pages, or ‘short’ papers of up to 6 pages including references. Up to 2 additional pages will be allowed in each category with over-length charges. Every additional page has a cost of $100.00 (CND). The standard IEEE two-column conference format should be used for all submissions. IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings can be downloaded here. The conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore as in previous editions of the conference. At least one author of an accepted paper must register by July 1, 2025. Accepted (short or regular) papers will be published in the proceedings.   
   
  Double-blind Submission  
 Reviewing will be double-blind: the reviewers will not know the identities of the authors. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper. For effective anonymization please follow these guidelines:  
  Do not include any author's name or affiliation in the title. Do not include any acknowledgments. Refer to your own published work in the third person: use “In the previous work of Jones et al.”, not “In our previous work”. If you cite own papers that are not widely available (e.g., a paper currently under review), use anonymous author names in the citation, for example, an author of the form “A. Anonymous”.

  How are ratings calculated?   To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzes reviews to verify trustworthiness.

  Submission Instructions  
 High-quality papers in all PST-related areas that, at the time of submission are not under review and have not already been published or accepted for publication elsewhere are solicited. Authors MUST ensure to select the track (Privacy, Security, or Trust) most relevant to their research when submitting their paper. Accepted papers will be accepted as ‘regular’ papers up to 10 pages, or ‘short’ papers of up to 5 pages. Up to 2 additional pages will be allowed in each category with over-length charges. Every additional page has a cost of $100.00 (CND). The standard IEEE two-column conference format should be used for all submissions.

  Double-blind Submission  
 Reviewing will be double-blind: the reviewers will not know the identities of the authors. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper. For effective anonymization please follow these guidelines:  
  Do not include any author's name or affiliation in the title. Do not include any acknowledgments. Refer to your own published work in the third person: use “In the previous work of Jones et al.”, not “In our previous work”. If you cite own papers that are not widely available (e.g., a paper currently under review), use anonymous author names in the citation, for example, an author of the form “A. Anonymous”.

 QCE24 News &  
  Updates       

 IEEE Quantum Week  — the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE)  — is bridging the gap between the science of quantum computing and the development of an industry surrounding it. As such, this event brings a perspective to the quantum industry different from academic or business conferences.
