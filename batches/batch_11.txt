 Monthly Featured   

 The biennial ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP)  , supported by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (ACM SIGHCI), formerly the ACM SIGGROUP Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP), the Conference on Organizational Computing Systems (COOCS), and the ACM SIGOIS (and IEEE CS TC-OA) Conference on Office Information Systems (COCS), is a premier venue for research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Human Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning and Socio-Technical Studies. A strong emphasis of GROUP conferences is to foster a discourse on collaborative technology that bridges the fields of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Information Systems (IS), Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), and “Learning at the workplace” (CSCL@Work). Relevant issues include the design, implementation, deployment, evaluation, and impact of these systems as well as examinations of relevant research methodologies. The conference integrates work in social science, computer science, engineering, design, values, and other diverse topics related to group work, broadly conceptualized.

 Call for Participation: Peace!  
 6 Comments      
  
 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

  Introduction  
 The 19th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2024) combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both, our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way.

6. Conference HASKELL_0:
The Haskell Symposium |  
  
   The Haskell  Symposium is an annual symposium organized in affiliation with the International Conference on Functional Programming ( ICFP  ). The symposium is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM  ) under the aegis of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages ( SIGPLAN  ).  
 Scope  
 The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to discuss experience with Haskell, and future developments for the language. The scope of the symposium includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory, application, implementation and teaching of Haskell.  
 Past Haskell Workshops and Symposia  
 Before 2008, the Haskell Symposium was known as the Haskell Workshop. The name change reflects the steady increase of influence of the Haskell Workshop on the wider community, as well as an increasing numbers of high quality submissions making the acceptance process highly competitive. Starting in 2019, the Haskell Implementors' Workshop  has been orchestrated by the Haskell Symposium steering committee, while remaining a distinct event.

 Steering Committee   
 Responsibilities  
 The main purpose of the Haskell Symposium Steering Committee is to provide continuity of the symposium and Haskell Implementors' Workshop and to offer help and advice to the current organizer(s) of the symposium.  
 The responsibilities of the steering committee are: To provide continuity of the Haskell Symposium and Haskell Implementors' Workshop serve the Haskell community, and maintain the functional vision and vigour of the symposium and workshop. 
  To officially represent the Haskell Symposium with the sponsoring organization, ACM SIGPLAN, and consult with the SIGPLAN chair on matters of policy and planning. 
  To appoint the Haskell Symposium Program Chair each year in consultation with the SIGPLAN Chair, and approve the Program Chair's choice of Program Committee. 
  To provide help and guidance to the Haskell Symposium Program Chair in the overall technical organization of the symposium, as well with budget preparation and the cooperation with affiliated conferences and workshops. 
  To appoint the Haskell Implementors' Workshop chair each year. 
  To assist in the coordination of the Haskell Symposium with the Haskell Implementors' Workshop. 
  Membership  
 The Haskell Symposium Steering Committee comprises the three previous Haskell Symposium Program Chairs, the current Haskell Symposium Chair two previous Haskell Implementors' Workshop chairs, the current Haskell Implementors' Workshop chair, three appointed Members-At-Large, and as a non-voting ex officio member the vice chair of the SIGPLAN executive committee. 
  Each year, around the date of the Haskell Symposium, the Steering Committee, in consultation with the SIGPLAN Chair, appoints the Program Chair for the next Haskell Symposium. The steering committee additionally appoints a Haskell Implementors' Workshop chair and a new Member-At-Large to succeed the currently longest serving Member-At-Large. The new chairs and the newly appointed Member-At-Large then join the Steering Committee, while the longest serving former chairs and Member-At-Large step down. 
  The chair of the Steering Committee is the longest serving former Haskell Symposium Program Chair. 
  Should there be vacancies within the Steering Committee, e.g. due to a member stepping down early, the Steering Committee appoints members to fill the vacancies and, if necessary, decides on the succession ordering.

  International Conference on Functional Programming  

 ICFP (International Conference on Functional Programming)  is an annual programming language conference. It is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM  ) under the aegis of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages ( SIGPLAN  ), in association with Working Group 2.8 of the International Federation of Information Processing ( IFIP  ). ICFP combined two former biennial conferences: Functional Programming and Computer Architecture (FPCA)  and Lisp and Functional Programming (LFP)  .  
 ICFP  provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries.  
 This page is designed to be a permanent home for information about, or relevant to, ICFP. As well as information about the conference itself, it contains pointers to journals, other conferences and workshops, and so on, that may be of interest. Please email suggestions for improvement to Sam Westrick  .  
 Scope  
 ICFP seeks original papers on the art and science of functional programming. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to practice, from foundations to features, from abstraction to application. The scope includes all languages that encourage functional programming, including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as languages with objects or concurrency. Particular topics of interest include:  
 Language Design: | type systems; concurrency and distribution; modules; components and composition; metaprogramming; relations to object-oriented or logic programming; interoperability 
  Implementation: | abstract machines; compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfaces to foreign functions, services components or low-level machine resources 
  Software-Development Techniques: | algorithms and data structures; design patterns; specification; verification; validation; proof assistants; debugging; testing; tracing; profiling 
  Foundations: | formal semantics; lambda calculus; rewriting; type theory; monads; continuations; control; state; effects 
  Transformation and Analysis: | abstract interpretation; partial evaluation; program transformation; program calculation; program proof 
  Applications and Domain-Specific Languages: | symbolic computing; formal-methods tools; artificial intelligence; systems programming; distributed-systems and web programming; hardware design; databases; XML processing; scientific and numerical computing; graphical user interfaces; multimedia programming; scripting; system administration; security; education 
  Functional Pearls: | elegant, instructive and fun essays on functional programming 
  The conference also solicits Experience Reports  , which are short papers that provide evidence that functional programming really works or describe obstacles that have kept it from working in a particular application.

  Hybrid event: Towards a History of British HCI 

 Hybrid event: Towards a History of British HCI  
  
 A seminar on the speaker's recent research on the History of Human-Computer Interaction in the UK.  
 Speaker  
 Elisabetta Mori  
 Agenda  
 2:30pm - Welcome  
  4:30pm - End  
 Synopsis  
 The seminar will share with the public the speaker’s recent research on the History of Human-Computer Interaction in the UK, enhanced by a series of new oral history interviews with academics and practitioners in the field. The history of British HCI is rich: Brian Shackel’s article Ergonomics for a Computer, published as early as 1959, is considered one of the first articles in the history of HCI. From the 1970s onwards several British centres in the UK focused on HCI research and development such as the Man-Machine Interaction Group at the NPL and the HUSAT at the University of Loughborough, among many others.  
 The BCS Specialist Group on Human-Computer Interaction was established in 1984, playing a role in the development of the field in the UK and in connecting with the international community. The British HCI conference was one of the main early international conferences that shaped the discipline, while the Alvey Programme, driven by industrial priorities, influenced and gave strength to HCI in the UK.  
 This research was supported by the Archives of IT and the History of Computing Collection, Swansea University, and by a grant from the Worshipful Company of Information Technologies.  
 About the speaker

 Haskell Programming Focuses on Improving Talent and Positions   

 Workforce Development Strategy powers up to support employees and the company’s strategic vision.

 The development of Haskell 2025, the company’s strategic plan for purposeful growth, created an increased demand for talent. Haskell leaders identified a need to attract and invest in top young professionals while also promoting the growth of existing roles and people.  
 Two of the Haskell 2025’s six pillars, “Expand Diversity” and “Optimize Intellectual Capital,” relate directly to the development of human resources. And the cornerstone of the entire plan, “Provide Team Members with the Best Job of Their Lives,” relies heavily on professional growth.  
 As a result, Haskell launched its Workforce Development Strategy, a division dedicated to maximizing growth and development of in-house talent as well as communicating to recruits the culture and values exemplified by team members.  
 As one of its first initiatives, Workforce Development launched a University Relations effort. Led by Director Mike Huskey, University Relations set out to formalize campus outreach, refreshing the Summer Internship Program, engaging year-round interns and increasing involvement on university campuses.  
 “Service is one of our core values,” Huskey said. “Our team members were doing a lot of that work already, but there was no business strategy around it. University Relations team is here to take those acts of kindness and acts of charity and make it a formalized approach for students.”  
 It soon was apparent that this level of outreach required a full-time effort, so University Relations formed as a separate division of Workforce Development, staffed by Huskey, a former Project Director and longtime Haskell employee, and Coordinator Deidre Brearley, another “True Blue” employee with nearly 20 years as a Haskell recruiter.  
 “Our focus is in connecting colleges and universities at a level that is appropriate for an employer to have,” Huskey said. “We don’t want to just swing in and be an employer at a career fair. We meet with the students. We act as an advisor in student organizations. We sponsor internship programs. We are establishing relationships with key university faculty. We’re actively recruiting and establishing relationships at HCBUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities).”  
 Internally, Workforce Development has evaluated multiple leadership positions in Haskell with an eye toward creating programming and long-term solutions for accelerated development. In one of its first projects, a clear plan was needed for superintendents in charge of jobsites to be developed more quickly and efficiently.  
 Three teams – Workforce Development, Talent Acquisition, and Construction Core – worked together to bring in recruits and team members. A pipeline for talent development was built to train superintendent recruits. Mike McLauchlan, Manager of Technical Training and Development, helped revamp and rebuild the Haskell superintendent curriculum with increased rigor and intensity. David Bates, Vice President of Construction Core, recruited, screened, and interviewed potential superintendents and shifted to a team interview model. A third-party recruiter was brought in to fill immediate gaps in the superintendent roles.  
 In the same way, the role of project director, who is the team lead of design and construction for an integrated Design-Build project, was reevaluated. It was found that training traditionally done through shadowing or mentoring could potentially leave a gap in knowledge and a limited scope of skillsets.  
 Workforce Development created programming, with the initial 12 training sessions beginning in July 2020, to source talent and train project directors for a more diverse range of skills. The plan not only intends to accelerate development for project directors but intends to connect leaders and teach problem-solving and collaboration.  
 “We want to make sure that we get the project directors knowing who the go-to people are, knowing what the expectations are, knowing how to solve a problem if they don’t have the solution at their fingertips, and feeling comfortable as one Haskell,” said Dave Balz, head of Workforce Development.  
 The teams’ roadmap leads to more review, revision and outreach. Workforce Development next plans to approach two projects – linking the relationship selling and niche product knowledge needed in technical sales roles, and readdressing Design Manager development. Meanwhile, University Relations plans to grow campus outreach by expanding involvement at universities by getting team members involved as guest lecturers, club sponsors, and more.

 HCOMP 2024  
   
 The Twelfth AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing  
  October 16–19, 2024  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  @hcomp_conf  – #HCOMP2024   

 Welcome to HCOMP 2024!  
 The 12th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2024) will be held October 16-19th in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and will particularly focus on the theme of '' Responsible Crowd Work for Better AI  .''  
 HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on human computation and crowdsourcing. While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. Our field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. We promote the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers but also engineers and practitioners to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice.  
 HCOMP 2024 is colocated with ACM UIST 2024  (October 13-16, 2024).  
     
 HCOMP 2024 builds on a successful history of past meetings  : eleven HCOMP conferences (2013–2023) and four earlier workshops, held at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2011–2012), and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2009–2010).  

 Announcements  
 Registration is now open!   
 The HCOMP Test of Time and Impact Award  will be announced and given out this year! For more information, check the technical program  .

 Submission deadline  is approaching: 25th June 2024 
 haisconference.eu | The 19th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2024)  combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality.

 AGENDA  
 14:30 - Welcome  
 16:30 - End  

 SYNOPSIS  
 The seminar will share with the public the speaker’s recent research on the History of Human-Computer Interaction in the UK, enhanced by a series of new oral history interviews with academics and practitioners in the field. The history of British HCI is rich: Brian Shackel’s article Ergonomics for a Computer, published as early as 1959, is considered one of the first articles in the history of HCI. From the 1970s onwards several British centres in the UK focused on HCI research and development such as the Man-Machine Interaction Group at the NPL and the HUSAT at the University of Loughborough, among many others. The BCS Specialist Group on Human-Computer Interaction was established in 1984, playing a role in the development of the field in the UK and in connecting with the international community. The British HCI conference was one of the main early international conferences that shaped the discipline, while the Alvey Programme, driven by industrial priorities, influenced and gave strength to HCI in the UK.  
 This research was supported by the Archives of IT and the History of Computing Collection, Swansea University, and by a grant from the Worshipful Company of Information Technologies.

  Keynote title: The long and winding road to success in B2B enterprise integration Governance dynamics, Data Platforms, Digital Twins and the promises of AI   
   
  Abstract: B2B integration has been receiving much interest over the past few decades. The history of B2B enterprise integration has witnessed fascinating successes and dramatic failures. Technology has made spectacular advances, through the emergence of webservices and APIs, Cloud-based integration platforms (iPAAS), data platforms, open data and federated architectures such as data spaces. Recently, digital twins and the rise of scalable AI based integration Agents add to the impressive technology stack that can be brought to the table in B2B projects. Still, the complexity of these projects goes beyond solving technical challenges. Several projects we have studied and contributed to in our research show that achieving sustainable value and success in B2B integration requires a combination of Technical, Ethical, Legal, Social and Business elements. Through a series of examples and longitudinal case studies from various industry sectors, I will show in this talk what lessons were learned and what the researchers can contribute to making B2B integration a less windy road to success.

 HCW 2025  
 The thirty-fourth Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop ( HCW  ) will be held at the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, on June 4, 2025  . HCW is annually organized in conjunction with the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium ( IPDPS  ).  
 Heterogeneous computing systems comprise growing numbers of increasingly more diverse computing resources that can be local to one another or geographically distributed. The opportunity and need for effectively utilizing heterogeneous computing resources has given rise to the notions of cluster computing, grid computing, and cloud computing. HCW encourages paper submissions from both the research and industry communities presenting novel ideas on theoretical and practical aspects of computing in heterogeneous computing environments.  
 The HCW 2025 Call for Papers will be available mid-December.

 In conjunction with the 39 th  IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium ( IPDPS 2025  )  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society  
  through the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP)  
 Most modern computing systems are heterogeneous  , either for organic reasons  because components grew independently, as it is the case in desktop grids, or by design  to leverage the strength of specific hardware, as it is the case in accelerated systems. In any case, all computing systems have some form of hardware or software heterogeneity   that must be managed, leveraged, understood, and exploited. The Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop (HCW) is a venue to discuss and innovate in all theoretical and practical aspects of heterogeneous computing: design, programmability, efficient utilization, algorithms, modeling, applications, etc. HCW 2025 will be the thirty-fourth annual gathering of this workshop.  
 The Call for Papers will be available mid-December.

 HCW 2025 Call for Papers  
 Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop  
 June 4, 2025  
  Milan, Italy  
 In conjunction with the 39 th  IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium ( IPDPS 2025  )  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society  
  through the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP)  
 Most modern computing systems are heterogeneous  , either for organic reasons  because components grew independently, as it is the case in desktop grids, or by design  to leverage the strength of specific hardware, as it is the case in accelerated systems. In any case, all computing systems have some form of hardware or software heterogeneity   that must be managed, leveraged, understood, and exploited. The Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop (HCW) is a venue to discuss and innovate in all theoretical and practical aspects of heterogeneous computing: design, programmability, efficient utilization, algorithms, modeling, applications, etc. HCW 2025 will be the thirty-fourth annual gathering of this workshop.  
 The Call for Papers will be available mid-December.  
 Workshop Organization  
 General Co-Chairs  : DK Panda and Hari Subramoni, The Ohio State University, USA  
 Technical Program Committee Chair  : Ali Akoglu, University of Arizona, USA  
 Questions may be sent to the HCW 2025 General Co-Chairs (DK Panda: panda.1 at osu dot edu, Hari Subramoni: subramoni.1 at osu dot no) or the Technical Program Committee Chair (Ali Akoglu: akoglu at arizona dot edu).

 The 12th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2024) was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from October 16-19, 2024. HCOMP 2024 focused on focused on the theme of “Responsible Crowd Work for Better AI” and was colocated with ACM UIST 2024.  
 HCOMP serves as an invaluable platform and believes in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research in human computation and crowdsourcing. Though artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) have been conventional cornerstones of the conference, HCOMP draws upon and contributes to various fields including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence, economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. It unites a diverse community of researchers, engineers, and practitioners, encouraging collaborative progress and innovation in this evolving discipline.

  (Click to Expand)  The first ever HCOMP Test of Time and Impact Award  will be announced and given out at HCOMP 2024. The award recognizes the most impactful HCOMP paper published a decade ago (withstanding the test of 10 years worth of time). For the instantiation of this award, papers published at the conference until the year 2014 were considered.  
 The award will be received by Aashish Sheshadri and Matthew Lease for their AAAI HCOMP 2013 paper titled, '' Square: A benchmark for research on computing crowd consensus  .'' The paper presented an open source shared task framework including benchmark datasets, defined tasks, standard metrics, and reference implementations with empirical results for popular methods at the time of publishing. This paper was instrumental in shaping work related to crowd consensus and efforts to improve response aggregation in crowdsourcing. It has been the most cited HCOMP paper during this period, and been widely used as a resource in crowdsourcing courses at different universities.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Held on two days of the five-day conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Held on two days of the five-day conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Held on two days of the five-day conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | .

 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community.

  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.

 39th IEEE International Parallel &   
  Distributed Processing Symposium   
  June 3-7, 2025   
 PLEASE NOTE:   
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, October 3, 2024. 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 10, 2024 | (firm deadline). 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
    
 SUBMIT YOUR PAPER     
   
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in high performance computing (HPC) in parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Algorithms: | This track focuses on algorithms for computational and data science in parallel and distributed computing environments (including cloud, edge, fog, distributed memory, and accelerator-based computing). | Examples include structured and unstructured mesh and meshless methods, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, n-body computations, clustering, data mining, compression, and combinatorial algorithms such as graph and string algorithms. Also included in this track are algorithms that apply to tightly or loosely coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, power management, distributed resource management, distributed data and transactions, and mobility. Novel algorithm designs and implementations tailored to emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators or quantum computing systems) are also included. 
  Applications: | This track focuses on real-world applications (combinatorial, scientific, engineering, data analysis, and visualization) that use parallel and distributed computing concepts. | Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate innovations that originate in specific target application areas, and contribute novel methods and approaches that address core challenges in their scalable implementation. Contributions include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications, including implementations targeting emerging architectures (such as ML/AI accelerators) and application domain advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Architecture | : | This track focuses on existing and emerging architectures for high performance computing, | including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicore, accelerator, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures (including ML/AI accelerators); reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies; co-design paradigms for processing-in-memory architectures; solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; and emerging architectural principles for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing. 
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI): | This track focuses on all areas of ML/AI that are relevant to parallel and distributed computing, | including ML/AI training on resource-limited platforms; computational optimization methods for AI such as pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation; parallel and distributed learning algorithms; energy-efficient methods for ML/AI; federated learning; design and implementation of ML/AI algorithms on parallel architectures (including distributed memory, GPUs, tensor cores and emerging ML/AI accelerators); new ML/AI methods benefitting HPC applications or HPC system management; and design and development of ML/AI software pipelines (e.g., frameworks for distributed training, integration of compression into ML/AI pipelines, compiler techniques and DSLs). Papers submitted to the ML/AI track should emphasize new ML/AI technology that is best reviewed by ML/AI experts. Papers that emphasize core parallel computing topics applied to ML/AI workloads or applications benefitting from use of existing ML/AI tools should be submitted to the topic domain tracks rather than this ML/AI track. 
  Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments: | This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing | . “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research accelerators and architectures, including quantum, neuromorphic, and other non-Von Neumann systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and experiences and methods for allocating and managing system and facility resources. 
  Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems: | This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms to runtime and middleware solutions | . Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included. Examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads; and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing. Novel compiler techniques and frameworks leveraging machine learning methods are included in this track. 
  System Software: | This track focuses on software that is close to the bare high-performance computing (HPC) hardware | . Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the operating system, hardware, and other software layers; system software solutions for ML/AI workloads (e.g., energy-efficient software methods for ML/AI); system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high-performance computing; system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing; and system software advances enabled by ML/AI. 
  Best Paper Award  
 The program committee will select a small set of papers as Best Paper finalists. One paper will be named the Best Paper.  
   
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award  
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with technical contributions of open-source tool and dataset artifacts relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community. The authors of accepted papers may identify their submissions to be considered for the Best Open-Source Contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as Best Open-Source Contribution finalists. One paper will be recognized with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award.  
 The two award categories are not exclusive; a paper can be nominated for both the Best Paper award and Best Open-Source Contribution award.   
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT  
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by October 3, 2024. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 10, 2024. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names for each reference cited. No supplementary sections or appendices are allowed beyond the stated page limit. The program committee will use a double-blind review process. Submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors due to the double-blind review process.   
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
  Files must be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2025 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Authors must select a “primary” track for the submission; the primary track is the area most related to the paper’s contributions. An optional “secondary” track may also be selected.  
 Submit the abstract and register your paper by October 3rd 
  REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS  
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind, two-round review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, demonstrated or potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference. Submitted manuscripts must NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
  A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the paper’s objective and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission addresses. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish the paper’s contributions from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach and make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify key theoretical or experimental methodological details. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite the prior works that have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If a new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions differ from prior art, provide a detailed justification. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | Articulate all significant limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will assess submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should make these aspects clear when articulating their contributions.   
  Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Some submissions may not be invited to submit a response/rebuttal; these submissions will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 3, 2024.  
 First round decisions – “accept,” “revise,” or “reject” – will be sent by December 19, 2024. Authors of papers in the “revise” category will have the opportunity to submit a new version of their papers addressing reviewers’ comments. The revised submission and a cover letter explaining changes are due on January 23, 2025. An ensuing review will then provide decisions of “accept” or “reject”; papers will be rejected if the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily addressed. Notification of final decisions will be sent by February 4, 2025. Camera-ready papers are due on February 27, 2025.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2025@ipdps.org   .  
 ArXiv Submission Policy  
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications; hence, they do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in conference or journal proceedings. Authors must follow the double-blind submission guidelines even if a submitted paper is already on arXiv. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, or not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period). Authors should not direct reviewers to arXiv versions of the paper; in their evaluations, reviewers will consider only the material in the submitted paper.  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text  
 Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants may be used to improve the submission presentation. However, authors will be held accountable for the accuracy of all information presented as well as for the contributions. IEEE requires   that the use of any AI-generated text be disclosed in the paper’s Acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that contain AI-generated text must have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  Steering Committee 

 Overview  
  
 In recent years anthropomorphic, mechanic and pet-like agents have spread globally, which allows various types of ordinary end user to interact with them. Although interaction design for robots and software agents has been investigated in different research fields, few studies were done on the subject for various agents in a unified aspect.  
 HAI (Human-Agent Interaction) is a novel research field to investigate and develop interaction design methods across conventional interactive platforms including robots, software agents and human-human communication through digital media. In HAI, mixtures of interactions of these platforms (human-robot, human-software agent, and human-human through agents) are studied. We aim to collect ideas of and clarify the common design policies through these interactions to further generate and develop HAI design methods based-on knowledge obtained from state of the art research and studies presented in this conference.

  Authors may include as many pages of appendices as they wish, but reviewers are not required to read these. If you wish to include an appendix, please add it after your references and keep in mind the double blind guidelines. 
  If any content in the Research Paper is generated using Artificial Intelligence tools, authors must transparently and thoroughly describe their use in the methods, acknowledgment, or equivalent section of the paper. Description is not necessary for tools used solely for improving spelling, grammar, and general editing. Authors are accountable for the accuracy of information provided by AI tools and for referencing any supporting work based on that information. 
  The double-blind review process applies to all submissions | ( see ISC High Performance Double-Blind Review Guidelines  ). | Please refrain from including names, affiliations, funding sources, or acknowledgments in the heading or body of the document. Authors should cite their own work in a third-party manner rather than redacting the citations. 
  Papers submitted for the Research Papers track should not have been previously published or under peer review for a different venue. Papers pre-posted to arXiv, institutional repositories, and personal websites remain eligible for submission. 
  Membership on a program committee does not inherently create a conflict of interest in submitting a paper. 

 Review Process   
        Each paper is expected to receive a minimum of 3 to 4 reviews 
  Papers will be evaluated based on novelty, fundamental insights, clarity of presentation, and potential for long-term impact 
  Reviewers will provide constructive, actionable feedback that can be used to improve the paper, whether it is eventually accepted or not 
  The Research Paper Committee reserves the right to reject incorrectly formatted papers 

  Rebuttal Phase   
        Initial reviewer comments will be made available to the authors by the committee 
  Authors can respond to clarify misunderstandings and answer questions 
  Rebuttals will be submitted in written format and will have a tight deadline 
  Authors will receive additional instructions via email 

  Final Decision   
        The paper’s track committee will consider all reviews and rebuttals 
  Live reviewer discussions will occur during the research paper committee meeting 
  A consensus-driven approach will be used to select the strongest papers 
  Notification of the papers’ outcomes will be sent to authors after the program committee’s meeting 

 Terms & Conditions  

 The research paper sessions will be held from June 10-12, 2025. 
  By submitting a research paper, you agree that one of the authors will present the work in person at ISC 2025. 
  For a paper to be included in the IEEE Xplore proceedings, at least one author must present it at the conference in person. Otherwise, the paper will be excluded from the proceedings. 
  One author is eligible for a complimentary conference participation pass. 
  Every paper presenter needs to submit a short, pre-recorded summary video of the paper before the conference. 
  Presentation slides and short videos will be available on the event platform (Swapcard) for registered attendees. 
  Travel, accommodation, registration fees for other authors, and other such expenses will not be covered by the ISC organizers. 

 Hans Meuer Award  

 Named in honor of ISC’s founding father, the winning research paper will receive a 3000 euro cash prize and an award certificate.

 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Usually held on the first and last day of the conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates typically fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference. Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a requirement of publication. Any paper that is not presented at the conference will not be included in IEEE Xplore.

 IPDPS 2024 Workshops 
 ABOUT IPDPS WORKSHOPS   
 Usually held on the first and last day of the conference, IPDPS workshops provide an extended forum that allows the IPDPS community an opportunity to fully explore special topics and to present work that is more preliminary and cutting-edge or that has more practical content than the more mature research presented in the main symposium. Each workshop has its own requirements and schedule for submissions. Workshop paper submission dates typically fall after the notification date for the main symposium papers. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference. Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a requirement of publication. Any paper that is not presented at the conference will not be included in IEEE Xplore.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.

 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware.

 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware.

 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware.

 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware.

 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware.

 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware.

 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.

  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 The purpose of the International Conference on Health Informatics is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the specification, design, development and application of information and communication technologies (ICT) to healthcare and medicine in general and to the support of persons with special needs in particular. Big data, networking, graphical interfaces, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition and intelligent decision support systems are just a few of the technologies and research areas currently contributing to medical informatics. Mobility and ubiquity in healthcare systems, physiological and behavioral modeling, standardization of health records, procedures, and technologies, certification, integration, scaling-up, privacy and security are some of the issues that medical informatics professionals and the ICT industry and research community in general are addressing to further promote ICT in healthcare. In the case of medical rehabilitation, assistive technologies, home monitoring, smart homes, research in and applications of ICT have contributed greatly to the enhancement of quality of life and full integration of all citizens into society.

 Admission Requirements  
 Introduction to Programming (course).  
 Without having passed this course, participation is not  possible.  
 Description  
 Robots and other intelligent agents are playing an increasing role in our society. Think about chatbots, telephone bots, robots in education at school, and robots in airports or restaurants, and even elderly with dementia. Some of these technologies even serve a social function for example as companions. But how do you actually program or script human-agent interaction (HAI)? How do you ensure a pleasant dialogue? How do you respond to a human? How do you measure what a human thinks, and how do you do it in a smart way so that the human doesn't find it annoying? Often, developing a pleasant interaction means dealing with different AI techniques, all of which are powerfull but not perfect. Further, novel techniques such as LLMs and TTS change the way we interact with AI rapidly. In this course, you will learn how to shape and program the interaction between humans and intelligent agent by making use of AI techniques,copnversational principles, and different modalities, and you learn how to evaluate your design using test subjects using an appropriate experimental setup.  
 Recommended prior knowledge:   
 Human cognition (Course: Intro Cognitive Science) 
  Programming, Python, (Course: Introduction to programming) 
  Course Objectives  
 Remember and understand the different theoretical concepts underlying Human agent interaction 
  Apply these theoretical concepts in the design of in interactive agent 
  Implement the design using suitable technology including but not limited to social robots, chat bots, virtual agents, TTS, STT, computer vision, etc... 
  Analyse and evaluate the implemented design using an appropriate experimental setup with human test subjects. 
  Collaborate as a group.

 29th International Workshop on High-Level Parallel Programming Models and Supportive Environments  
 Overview  
 The 29th HIPS workshop, proposed as a full-day meeting at the IEEE IPDPS 2024 conference in San Francisco, California, USA, focuses on high-level programming of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines. Like previous workshops in the series, which was established in 1996 this event will serve as a forum for research in the areas of parallel applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for papers, we especially encouraged innovative approaches in the areas of emerging programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core architectures. An additional emphasis this year will be on post-von Neumann architectures and deep memories hierarchies to encourage new developments in programming models for HPC.

 Title: Architecture and Programming of Analog In-Memory- Computing Accelerators for Deep Neural Networks   
  Dr. HsinYu (Sidney) Tsai (IBM Research)   
 Abstract:  
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated revolutionary capabilities in AI, such as machine vision, natural language processing, and content generation. However, the growing energy usage due to the excessive amount of data communication between compute and memory units highlights the need to address the “Von Neumann bottleneck.” In-memory computing can achieve high throughput and energy efficiency by computing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations using Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s current law on arrays of resistive memory devices. In recent years, Analog non-volatile memory (NVM)-based accelerators with energy-efficient, weight-stationary MAC operations in analog NVM memory-array “Tiles” have been demonstrated in hardware using Phase Change Memory (PCM) devices integrated in the backend of 14-nm CMOS. Based on the hardware demonstrations, we propose a highly heterogeneous and programmable accelerator architecture that takes advantage of a dense and efficient circuit-switched 2D mesh. This flexible architecture can accelerate Transformer, Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM), and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) while keeping data communication local and massively parallel. We show that by co-optimizing memory devices, DNN algorithms, and specialized digital circuits, competitive end-to-end DNN accuracies can be obtained with the help of hardware-aware training. The author would like to thank all colleagues at IBM Research Almaden, Yorktown, Albany NanoTech, Zurich and Tokyo for their contributions to this work and the IBM Research AI HW Center.  
 Biography:

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN)  
 Area Chairs  : Long Tran-Thanh, Bo An, Marc Lanctot, Chongjie Zhang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Xu, Jakob Foerster  
 Topics  :  
 Reasoning and learning under uncertainty 
  Supervised learning 
  Unsupervised and representation learning 
  Reinforcement learning 
  Multiagent learning 
  Evolutionary algorithms 
  Learning agent capabilities 
  Learning agent-to-agent interactions

  Adversarial learning 
  Description  : Autonomous Agents must sense, deliberate, act and communicate in potentially complex and uncertain environments. In addition, in many cases, they must interact with other agents and/or humans. Anticipating each situation and hardcoding the appropriate agent behavior becomes impossible as the complexity of the environment and interactions increase. As such, adaptivity and learning are key properties that imbue autonomy to agents operating and communicating in the real world. Papers in this area focus on all aspects of single agent and multiagent planning, learning and communication.  
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP)  
 Area Chairs  : Reshef Meir, Nisarg Shah, Georgios Piliouras, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Rica Gonen

  Responsible socio-technical systems 
  Description  : Research in agent and multiagent systems has a long history of developing techniques that balance agent autonomy, adaptation, and distributed social reasoning with system-level considerations such as organizational and institutional policy enforcement addressing safety, security and fairness considerations. Teamwork and human-machine cooperation has an increased relevance with the transformation of our societies into socio-technical systems. We need to ensure transparency, foster trust, and ensure social reasoning conforms to societal norms and expectations. We also need to ensure human-machine and machine-machine cooperation is fostered responsibly, within an adequate accountability system and in alignment with the ethical values of individuals concerned. We encourage the submission of papers that highlight the design, development, evaluation, simulation, and analysis of novel, innovative, and impactful research on issues related to the above topics.

 Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR)  
 Area Chairs  : Natasha Alechina, Aparna Taneja, Alessio Lomuscio  
 Topics  :  
 Computer vision 
  Representation learning and generative AI 
  Neurosymbolic approaches

  Description  : This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to knowledge representation and reasoning in single-agent and multi-agent systems. Knowledge representation is to be understood broadly, ranging from theoretical contributions (e.g., epistemic, strategic, description, and other logics) to representation learning. Moreover, representation and reasoning in complex settings often entails reasoning about sensing and perception. Relevant forms of reasoning include, for instance, automated reasoning and theorem proving approaches, verification-based approaches, as well as probabilistic reasoning and neurosymbolic approaches, as long as they are applied to, or motivated by reasoning about agents and/or multiagent systems.  
 Engineering and Analysis of Multiagent Systems (EMAS)  
 Area Chairs:  Viviana Mascardi, Daniela Briola  
 Topics:   
 Requirements and formal specification 
  Architecture and modeling

Contributions that demonstrate the benefit of such abstractions and methodologies for interesting application domains and other technological paradigms are also welcome. Naturally, the scope of this area spans the entire software engineering lifecycle — from requirements and verification to testing, validation, and evolution.  
 Modeling and Simulation of (Artificial) Societies (SIM)  
 Area Chairs  : Ana Bazzan, Samarth Swarup  
 Topics  :  
 Analysis of agent-based simulations

  Simulation of complex systems 
  Simulation techniques, tools and platforms 
  Social simulation 
  Validation of social simulation systems 
  Description  : Artificial societies are computer simulations or models that are created to emulate and research the behavior of intricate social systems. These societies simulate the interactions and dynamics of people, animals or other organisms to understand how individual behaviors lead to emergent structures and interactions. Agent-based models of artificial society provide a way to analyze the impact of regulations, incentives and other interventions that help to understand the complex dynamics of society as a whole. The area aims to find efficient solutions to model and simulate complex societal systems using agents-based models. Important application areas include ecology, biology, economics, transportation, management, organizational, and social sciences in general. In these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, exploration and testing of hypotheses, and better system designs.  
 Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)  
 Area Chairs  : Michael Goodrich, Birgit Lugrin  
 Topics  :  
 Human-agent interaction 
  Agent-based analysis of human interactions 
  Socially interactive agents 
  Trust and explainability in human-agent interactions 
  Human-robot interaction and collaboration 
  Social robotics and social interactions 
  Mixed-initiative and shared autonomy in human-agent interactions 
  Groups of humans and agents 
  Agents models and architectures for interaction with humans 
  Designing for human-agent interaction 
  Virtual humans 
  Description  :  
 Human interaction with artificially intelligent agents is becoming more commonplace, as such, developing and evaluating agents that can understand humans’ dynamics to support competent interaction. Significant challenges arise when transitioning from pure multiagent systems to hybrid systems that need to incorporate bi-directional human and agent interactions and sustain different competitive or collaborative situations. Agents need new models and architectures to better address the interaction with humans, including perception and recognition of humans’ internal states and activities at different levels, interaction modalities that support true coordination, and incorporation of human factors and ethics concerns. The design of human-agent interaction needs special concerns that combine requirements from the perspectives of both the agents and the humans. The interactive behavior of such agents can be inspired by human-human interaction and can, additionally, be embodied by virtual agents or robots to scaffold intuitive interaction.

All papers at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence (and agent research, specifically) are in the scope of the robotics area at AAMAS.  
 Innovative Applications (IA)  
 Area Chairs  : Thanh Nguyen, Pradeep Varakantham  
 Topics  :  
 Deployed or emerging applications of agent-based systems 
  Realistic agent-based models of human organizations 
  Evaluation of the cognitive capabilities of agent-based systems 
  Integrated applications of agent-based and other technologies 
  Challenges and best practices of real-world deployments of agent-based technologies

  Description  : Autonomous Agents must sense, deliberate, act and communicate in potentially complex and uncertain environments. In addition, in many cases, they must interact with other agents and/or humans. Anticipating each situation and hardcoding the appropriate agent behavior becomes impossible as the complexity of the environment and interactions increase. As such, adaptivity and learning are key properties that imbue autonomy to agents operating and communicating in the real world. Papers in this area focus on all aspects of single agent and multiagent planning, learning and communication.

These societies simulate the interactions and dynamics of people, animals or other organisms to understand how individual behaviors lead to emergent structures and interactions. Agent-based models of artificial society provide a way to analyze the impact of regulations, incentives and other interventions that help to understand the complex dynamics of society as a whole. The area aims to find efficient solutions to model and simulate complex societal systems using agents-based models. Important application areas include ecology, biology, economics, transportation, management, organizational, and social sciences in general. In these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, exploration and testing of hypotheses, and better system designs.  
 Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)

  Human-robot interaction and collaboration 
  Social robotics and social interactions 
  Mixed-initiative and shared autonomy in human-agent interactions 
  Groups of humans and agents 
  Agents models and architectures for interaction with humans 
  Designing for human-agent interaction 
  Virtual humans 
  Description  :  
 Human interaction with artificially intelligent agents is becoming more commonplace, as such, developing and evaluating agents that can understand humans’ dynamics to support competent interaction. Significant challenges arise when transitioning from pure multiagent systems to hybrid systems that need to incorporate bi-directional human and agent interactions and sustain different competitive or collaborative situations. Agents need new models and architectures to better address the interaction with humans, including perception and recognition of humans’ internal states and activities at different levels, interaction modalities that support true coordination, and incorporation of human factors and ethics concerns. The design of human-agent interaction needs special concerns that combine requirements from the perspectives of both the agents and the humans. The interactive behavior of such agents can be inspired by human-human interaction and can, additionally, be embodied by virtual agents or robots to scaffold intuitive interaction.

 Area Chairs  : Thanh Nguyen, Pradeep Varakantham  
 Topics  :  
 Deployed or emerging applications of agent-based systems 
  Realistic agent-based models of human organizations 
  Evaluation of the cognitive capabilities of agent-based systems 
  Integrated applications of agent-based and other technologies

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series dedicated to exploring AI systems that work collaboratively, proactively, and purposefully alongside humans, enhancing rather than replacing human intelligence. The goal of HHAI is to develop AI systems that complement human abilities, highlighting the importance of adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive, and human-centered intelligence. These systems leverage human strengths and compensate for weaknesses, while also considering social, ethical, and legal implications.  
 The fourth HHAI conference will take place from June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy.   
 Though the HHAI field is propelled by advances in AI, it requires fundamentally innovative approaches and solutions. We encourage collaboration across various research areas such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy, ethics, and complex systems. For this fourth international conference, we invite researchers from these fields to submit their best original or ongoing work, as well as forward-looking ideas, on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence.

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI 2025)    

 Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series that focuses on the study of Artificial Intelligence systems that cooperate synergistically, proactively and purposefully with humans, amplifying instead of replacing human intelligence. HHAI aims for AI systems that work together with humans, emphasizing the need for adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive and human-centered intelligent systems. HHAI systems leverage human strengths and compensate for human weaknesses, while taking into account social, ethical and legal considerations.  
 HHAI 2025 will be held on June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy, and is the fourth conference in the series.   
 The HHAI field is driven by developments in AI, but it also requires fundamentally new approaches and solutions. Thus, we encourage collaborations across research domains such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy and ethics, complex systems, and others.
