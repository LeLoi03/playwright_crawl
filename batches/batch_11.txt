 Call for Papers    

 Overview  
 The 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society. It provides an international forum for researchers, educators, and practitioners to learn, share knowledge, report most recent innovations and developments, and exchange ideas and advances in all aspects of systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and cybernetics. The theme of the IEEE SMC 2025 conference is “Navigating Frontiers: Smart Systems for a Dynamic World”.  

 Submission Guidelines  
 Authors must adhere to the IEEE conference written paper format (including paper title, authors and affiliations, figures, and references) and they must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadlines (see dates below). These are submitted through the PaperCept submission system (see link above). IEEE is very strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.  We strongly recommend using the set of templates in MS Word  and LaTeX  format provided by IEEE. A4 page size should be used. Please use them to create your paper, but don’t modify the style or the format under any circumstances.  
 Submit only original work, not previously published or copyrighted. Prospective authors are expected to submit only their original works. The conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to help verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE’s publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, then disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE. For further details please have a look at the Conference Authors @ IEEE Author Center.   
 Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings, which will be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library  , once it meets the requirements of an IEEE quality review.  
 For paper or abstract submission, please use the template provided by the PaperCept system: https://conf.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl

 Overview  
 The 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society. It provides an international forum for researchers, educators, and practitioners to learn, share knowledge, report most recent innovations and developments, and exchange ideas and advances in all aspects of systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and cybernetics. The theme of the IEEE SMC 2025 conference is “Navigating Frontiers: Smart Systems for a Dynamic World”.  

 Submission Guidelines  
 Authors must adhere to the IEEE conference written paper format (including paper title, authors and affiliations, figures, and references) and they must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadlines (see dates below). These are submitted through the PaperCept submission system (see link above). IEEE is very strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.  We strongly recommend using the set of templates in MS Word  and LaTeX  format provided by IEEE. A4 page size should be used. Please use them to create your paper, but don’t modify the style or the format under any circumstances.  
 Submit only original work, not previously published or copyrighted. Prospective authors are expected to submit only their original works. The conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to help verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE’s publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, then disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE. For further details please have a look at the Conference Authors @ IEEE Author Center.   
 Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings, which will be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library  , once it meets the requirements of an IEEE quality review.  
 For paper or abstract submission, please use the template provided by the PaperCept system: https://conf.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl

 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March  
  IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions.  
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March  
  IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia.  
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities.  
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions.  
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

 Best Industry Related Paper Award  
 Home     » Awards     » ICPR Awards     » Best Industry Related Paper Award       

 The Best Industry Related Paper Award will be awarded at each ICPR. The paper will be selected by a committee appointed by the Chair of the Industry Liaison Committee.  
   
  The award is given to a paper selected for oral presentation at ICPR, where at least one of the authors is from a company or technology transfer organization.  
   
  The award is officially announced at the conference dinner. However, there is traditionally a Best Industry Related Paper Award session during the conference some time before the dinner, where the nominees discuss the relation between academic and industrial research. The BIRPA award winner is unofficially announced at this session.  
 Award Procedure   
 The ICPR paper submission system needs to allow authors to self-nominate for the award, where one author must be from a company or a technology transfer organization. Purely university author lists are not eligible. The Program Chair is responsible for ensuring the submission system allows self-nomination. 
  Once paper acceptances are announced and the 'camera-ready' versions of the papers are submitted, the ILC Chair asks the Program Chair for the list of and PDFs of the highly ranked self-nominated oral papers, along with the reviews for those papers. 
  Each ILC member gets (3*num_papers/committee_size) revised papers to read, along with the original reviews. The ILC member does not need to write anything, but is asked to rank the papers in order of best to worst. There is a 3 week deadline. The papers are 6 pages long, so this should take maybe 5 hours. 
  From the ranked papers, the ILC chair selects the top 5(ish) based on the preliminary rankings. The whole ILC reads these and ranks them again. There is a 3 week deadline. 
  From these final rankings, a consensus ordering is formed. The ILC Chair keeps the committee informed about the process. 
  The Chair passes the selected winner's details to the IAPR's Secretary and the IAPR office. 
  The Chair and ICPR Program Chair schedule a 1 hour award session, where the nominees will be asked to give a 5 minute presentation on the relation of research and industry. There will be a panel discussion afterwards, and then finally the announcement of the BIRPA prize. The presentation and panel discussion is not a factor in the award decision.

  Research and innovation 

  At Inria Chile, we work in an agile environment based on collaboration that promotes scientific excellence, development, and innovation. We always collaborate with academia and industry to meet the challenges of Chile's digital transformation of science, society, and the economy.   
   
 We support digital transformation through research and innovation!  

 R&D Lines  
   
 Our scientists, our engineers, produce knowledge, develop technologies, and focus on applications related to the main problems of our society and industry. For Inria, Chile represents the possibility of generating new knowledge and new impact applications thanks to its natural and economic specificities. In Chile, Inria works in areas such as astronomy, resilience, and mining, which make the Center a unique player in the Institute. It also applies its knowledge to economic sectors and areas of the future for both Chile and France: intelligent agriculture, biodiversity, and "frugal digital" with his research project on green artificial intelligence.  
 We frame our work in six main lines:  

 Artificial intelligence    

 Algorithmes et informatique quantiques    

 Interaction and visualization    

 Data science    

 Modeling and simulation    

 Internet of things    

 Inria's instruments for the support of research and international scientific collaboration:  
   
 Inria is sure that international collaboration and cooperation are the keys to building the society of tomorrow and responding to its challenges by generating and sharing knowledge.

  SCOPE  
   
 The International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER), focuses on the highly important area of Cloud Computing, inspired by some latest advances that concern the infrastructure, operations, and available services through the global network. Further, the conference considers as essential the link to Services Science, acknowledging the service-orientation in most current IT-driven collaborations. The conference is nevertheless not about the union of these two (already broad) fields, but about Cloud Computing where we are also interested in how Services Science can provide theory, methods and techniques to design, analyze, manage, market and study various aspects of Cloud Computing.  
 Emerging Enterprise Technologies are profoundly changing the way we think of IT - from economics and efficiency to process and usage models. Many organizations look to the "externalized" IT systems and services as a potential cost-savings advantage by moving internally hosted IT services to external providers. Other organizations view the "external" IT as potential disaster recovery systems or as on-demand capacity to boost business continuity and customer service levels. We need to take a closer look, discerning what emerging enterprise technologies are and how they can catalyze creativity and produce a competitive advantage. There is hence a new wave of interest in 'Externalization of IT' - anything as a service (including Software as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service), On Demand delivery, outsourcing, edge cloud and so on. This emerging facilitation and way of utilizing services through IT is what we are referring to as Cloud Computing.

 Abstract  
   
 The combination of different intelligent methods is a very active research area in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The aim is to create integrated or hybrid methods that benefit from each of their components. Some of the existing efforts combine soft computing methods either among themselves or with more traditional AI methods such as logic and rules. Another stream of efforts integrates machine learning with soft-computing or traditional AI methods. Yet another integrates agent-based approaches with logic and also non-symbolic approaches. Some of the combinations have been quite important and more extensively used, like neuro-symbolic methods, neuro-fuzzy methods and methods combining rule-based and case-based reasoning. However, there are other combinations that are still under investigation, such as those related to the Semantic Web. The 2nd Workshop on “Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications” (CIMA 2010) was intended to become a forum for exchanging experience and ideas among researchers and practitioners who are dealing with combining intelligent methods either based on first principles or in the context of specific applications. CIMA 2010 was held in conjunction with the 22nd IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI 2010). Also, a special track was organized in ICTAI 2010, under the same title. This volume includes revised versions of the papers presented in CIMA 2010 and one of the short papers presented in the corresponding ICTAI 2010 special track. It also includes a paper of the editors as invited.

 Defeasible Planning through Multi-agent Argumentation    
   
 Full-text available    
 Chapter    

 Jan 1970 
  Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications 
  pp.1-19 

 The work reported here introduces DefPlanner, an argumentation-based partial-order planner where different agents that have a partial, and possibly contradictory, knowledge of the world articulate arguments for and against supporting preconditions of the actions to be included in a plan. In this paper, we introduce an extension to multiple agents of the defeasible argumentation formalism that has been proposed to address the task of planning in a single agent environment.   

 Operator Behavior Modelling in a Submarine    
   
 Full-text available    
 Chapter    

 Jan 1970 
  Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications 
  pp.21-39 

 Simulations of naval action estimate the operational performance of warships or submarines for a given scenario. In common models, the operator’s reactions are predefined. This is not realistic: the operator’s decision can produce unexpected reactions. This paper presents a method to model operator decision in simulations. This method allows to reason about incomplete, revisable and uncertain information: an operator has partial information about his environment only and must revise his decisions. Our method uses a nonmonotonic logic: the rules of behavior are formalized with default logic, to which we added a consideration of time. Our method uses preferences to manage choice between different rules, with simple probabilistic techniques. This method has been implemented in Prolog, interfaced to DCNS simulator framework and applied to a scenario involving two adverse submarines.   

 Representing Temporal Knowledge in the Semantic Web: The Extended 4D Fluents Approach    
   
 Full-text available    
 Chapter    

 Mar 2011 
  Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications 
  pp.55-69 

 Representing information that evolves in time in ontologies, as well as reasoning over static and dynamic ontologies are the areas of interest in this work. Building upon well established standards of the semantic Web and the 4D-fluents approach for representing the evolution of temporal information in ontologies, this work demonstrates how qualitative temporal relations that are common in natural language expressions (i.e., relations between time intervals like “before”, “after”, etc.) are represented in ontologies. Existing approaches allow for representations of temporal information, but do not support representation of qualitative relations and reasoning.   

 Combining a Multi-Document Update Summarization System –CBSEAS– with a Genetic Algorithm    
   
 Chapter    

 Jan 1970 
  Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications 
  pp.71-87 

 In this paper, we present a combination of a multi-document summarization system with a genetic algorithm. We first introduce a novel approach for automatic summarization. CBSEAS, the system which implements this approach, integrates a new method to detect redundancy at its very core in order to produce summaries with a good informational diversity. However, the evaluation of our system at TAC 2008—Text Analysis Conference—revealed that system adaptation to a specific domain is fundamental to obtain summaries of an acceptable quality. The second part of this paper is dedicated to a genetic algorithm which aims to adapt our system to specific domains. We present its evaluation by TAC 2009 on a newswire articles summarization task and show that this optimization is having a great influence on both human and automatic evaluations.

 Extraction of Essential Events with Application to Damage Evaluation on Fuel Cells    
   
 Full-text available    
 Chapter    

 Mar 2011 
  Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications 
  pp.89-108 

 Although sudden changes of the event phase in complex system may indicate underlying essential forces, such events are not frequent. In the present paper, we propose an essential event extractor (E3) scheme to extract relatively rare but co-occurring event sequences in event phase transitions. In E3, the self-organizing map (SOM) is used as vector quantization (VQ) to encode non-symbolic events and KeyGraph as a co-occurrence graph. Afterwards, event transitions on the co-occurrence graph can be obtained by referring to an occurrence density estimation on the topology map of VQ. We demonstrate the E3 using an acoustic emission (AE) event sequence observed during a damage test of fuel cells and obtain reasonable and essential co-occurring damage sequences that exhibit mechanical effects.   

 Detecting Car Accidents Based on Traffic Flow Measurements Using Machine Learning Techniques    
   
 Full-text available    
 Chapter    

 Jan 1970 
  Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications 
  pp.109-124 

 This paper deals with the problem of detecting the occurrence of a car accident in an urban environment. Firstly, a model based on Cellular Automata is designed to simulate the traffic flow with its main features such as: multiple lanes, cars traffic lights, buses and bus stops. Afterwards, machine learning techniques are trained with the traffic flow measurements considering both the normal and the situation in which the accident caused a partial closure of the lanes. Several machine learning techniques results are presented to several car breaking scenarios.

 Next Generation Environments for Context-Aware Learning Design    
   
 Full-text available    
 Chapter    

 Mar 2011 
  Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications 
  pp.125-143 

 Next generation Learning Design tools and applications have similar design requirements as intelligent applications that create share and re-use content through the use of data specifications or formal models. In this paper, we present an approach that combines ontologies and autonomic computing principles to design and build next generation learning design environments that possess context-aware features. Our approach builds on the features of self-management and organisation of autonomic computing but uses self-configuration as a means to extend a knowledgebased inference through the design of meta-level inference. This leads to the design and implementation of a next generation learning design tool that is context-aware supporting both knowledge push and knowledge pull to enable appropriate use of theory and practice when creating learning designs for use in higher education.   

 Neurules-A Type of Neuro-symbolic Rules: An Overview    
   
 Full-text available    
 Chapter    

 Mar 2011 
  Combinations of Intelligent Methods and Applications 
  pp.145-165 

 Neurules are a kind of integrated rules integrating neurocomputing and production rules. Each neurule is represented as an adaline unit. Thus, the corresponding neurule base consists of a number of autonomous adaline units (neurules). Due to this fact, a modular and natural knowledge base is constructed, in contrast to existing connectionist knowledge bases. In this paper, we present an overview of our main work involving neurules. We focus on aspects concerning construction of neurules efficient updates of neurule bases, neurule-based inference and combination of neurules with case-based reasoning. Neurules may be constructed from either symbolic rule bases or empirical data in the form of training examples. Due to the fact that the source knowledge of neurules may change with time, efficient updates of corresponding neurule bases to reflect such changes are performed. Furthermore, the neurule-based inference mechanism is interactive and more efficient than the inference mechanism used in connectionist expert systems. Finally, neurules can be naturally combined with case-based reasoning to provide a more effective representation scheme that exploits multiple knowledge sources and provides enhanced reasoning capabilities.

 The goal of the growing discipline of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is to develop AI systems with more human-like reasoning capabilities by combining symbolic reasoning with connectionist learning. We survey the literature on neuro-symbolic AI during the last two decades, including books, monographs, review papers, contribution pieces, opinion articles, foundational workshops/talks, and related PhD theses. Four main features of neuro-symbolic AI are discussed, including representation, learning, reasoning, and decision-making. Finally, we discuss the many applications of neuro-symbolic AI, including question answering, robotics, computer vision, healthcare, and more. Scalability, explainability, and ethical considerations are also covered, as well as other difficulties and limits of neuro-symbolic AI. This study summarizes the current state of the art in neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence.

 Behavior-Based Decision Making: A Tutorial    
   
 Article    
 Full-text available    
 Dec 2018 

 Mohammad Samadi 
    
 There are ingenious characteristics in humanistic behaviors so that they can be utilized by the most developers to design smart and complex systems. This paper proposes a novel, knowledge and learning based method called behavior-based decision making, BBDM, in control and system engineering. It is an expert decision support system containing the learning ability to work based on humanistic behavioral reasoning. The knowledge base is built by the system based on various behavioral styles (e.g., safe) associated to other systems and humans. BBDM uses the knowledge-based information to make appropriate decisions when any desired behavioral style is requested from the system. It specifies a success rate for any desired style based on the obtained knowledge base with the aid of a behavioral inference system. This procedure can be used to select a proper system or human to accomplish a requested job. All operations of the BBDM method are performed by a proposed behavioral decision system, called BDS, which consists of three main units: decomposition, behavioral inference, and composition. The decomposition unit splits any behavioral style into several optional features (e.g., safety). The behavioral aggregation sub-unit aggregates all behavioral styles obtained by the system to define the total behavior. The behavioral inference unit produces a success set for any desired behavioral style. Finally, the composition unit converts success set to success rate to specify the success probability of the desired style. Simulation results show that the proposed method has a high efficiency compared to some of the existing decision-making methods. Graphical Abstract

 Fuzzy and neuro-symbolic approaches in personal credit scoring: Assessment of bank loan applicants    
   
 Article    
 Jan 2014

 Credit scoring is a vital task in the financial domain. An important aspect in credit scoring involves the assessment of bank loan applications. Loan applications are frequently assessed by banking personnel regarding the ability/possibility of satisfactorily dealing with loan demands. Intelligent methods may be employed to assist in the required tasks. In this chapter, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of two separate intelligent systems that assess bank loan applications. The systems employ different knowledge representation formalisms. More specifically, the corresponding intelligent systems are a fuzzy expert system and a neuro-symbolic expert system. The former employs fuzzy rules based on knowledge elicited from experts. The latter is based on neurules, a type of neuro-symbolic rules that combine a symbolic (production rules) and a connectionist (adaline unit) representation. A characteristic of neurules is that they retain the naturalness and modularity of symbolic rules. Neurules were produced from available patterns. Evaluation showed that the performance of both systems is close although their knowledge bases were derived from different types of source knowledge.

 Assessment of life insurance applications: An approach integrating neuro-symbolic rule-based with case-based reasoning    
   
 Article

 Assessment of applications for life insurance is an important task in the insurance sector that concerns estimation of potential risks underlying an application, if accepted. This task is accomplished by specialized personnel of insurance companies. Because of recent financial crises, this task is more demanding, and intelligent computer-based methods could be employed to assist. In this paper, we present an intelligent approach to assessment of life insurance applications, which is based on an integration of neurule-based with case-based reasoning. Neurules are a type of neuro-symbolic rules that combine a symbolic (production rules) and a connectionist (adaline unit) representation. A characteristic of neurules is that in contrast to other hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, they retain the naturalness and modularity of symbolic rules. Neurules are produced from available symbolic rules that represent general knowledge, which however do not completely cover the domain. We use health condition, age, gender, annual income, profession, insurance type and primary life insurance benefit as assessment parameters used in rule conditions. The integration of neurules and cases employs different types of indices for the cases according to different roles they play in neurule-based reasoning. This results in its accuracy improvement. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

 Improving efficiency of merging symbolic rules into integrated rules: Splitting methods and mergability criteria

 Neurules are a type of neuro-symbolic rules integrating neurocomputing and production rules. Each neurule is represented as an adaline unit. Neurules exhibit characteristics such as modularity, naturalness and ability to perform interactive and integrated inferences and provide explanations for reached conclusions. One way of producing a neurule base is through conversion of an existing symbolic rule base yielding an equivalent but more compact rule base. The conversion process merges symbolic rules having the same conclusion into one or more neurules. Because of the inability of the adaline unit to handle inseparability, more than one neurule for each conclusion may be produced by splitting the initial set of symbolic rules into subsets. This paper presents research work improving the conversion process in terms of runtime and number of produced neurules. First, we show how easier it is to construct a neurule base than a connectionist one. Second, we present alternative rule set splitting methods. Finally, we define criteria concerning the ability or inability to convert a rule set into a single, equivalent, but more compact rule. With application of such mergability criteria, the conversion process of symbolic rules into neurules becomes more time-efficient. All the aforementioned are supported by experimental results.

 Neurules are a kind of integrated rules integrating neurocomputing and production rules. Neurules can be produced from existing empirical data, through the neurules production algorithm (NPA). In this paper, we present (a) an extension to NPA regarding presentation of neurules, so that they are more natural and more informative, and (b) an experimental comparison of various alternative strategies we can use at some points of NPA targeting at producing as less neurules as possible. Results of (b) show no clear winner for all cases in terms of the gain in number of neurules compared to the computational cost.

  Call For Papers 

 Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Research (CAIR), Chennai Institute of Technology organizes International Conference on Data Science, Agents and Artificial Intelligence 2025 in association with IEEE Madras Chapter, IEEE Computer Society Madras Section and Computer Society of India during March 28 & 29, 2025.  
 A call is made here inviting researchers and students who are involved in the research on Data Science, Agents and Artificial Intelligence. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications. Much of this important work is therefore theoretical in nature. However there is nothing as practical as a good theory, and some theories have indeed made their way into practice. Informatics applications are pervasive in many areas of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Distributed AI, including Agents and Multi-Agent Systems; this conference intends to emphasize this connection, therefore, authors are invited to highlight the benefits of Information Technology (IT) in these areas. Ideas on how to solve problems using Data Science, Agents and Artificial intelligence, both in R&D and industrial applications, are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below.

  Call For Papers 

 Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Research (CAIR), Chennai Institute of Technology organizes International Conference on Data Science, Agents and Artificial Intelligence 2025 in association with IEEE Madras Chapter, IEEE Computer Society Madras Section and Computer Society of India during March 28 & 29, 2025.  
 A call is made here inviting researchers and students who are involved in the research on Data Science, Agents and Artificial Intelligence. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications. Much of this important work is therefore theoretical in nature. However there is nothing as practical as a good theory, and some theories have indeed made their way into practice. Informatics applications are pervasive in many areas of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Distributed AI, including Agents and Multi-Agent Systems; this conference intends to emphasize this connection, therefore, authors are invited to highlight the benefits of Information Technology (IT) in these areas. Ideas on how to solve problems using Data Science, Agents and Artificial intelligence, both in R&D and industrial applications, are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below.

  Scope of the Workshop  
 The International Workshop on Computational Intelligence for Multimedia Understanding (IWCIM) is the annual workshop organized by the working group Multimedia Understanding through Semantics, Computation and Learning (MUSCLE) of the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM). This year, IWCIM takes place as a special session in IEEE ISCAS 2025, to be held in London on May 25 - 28, 2025.  
 Multimedia understanding is an essential part of many intelligent applications in our social life, be it in our households, or in commercial, industrial, service, and scientific environments. Analyzing raw data to provide them with semantics is essential to exploit their full potential and help us manage our everyday tasks. Nowadays raw data usually come from a host of different sensors and other sources, and are different in nature, format reliability and information content. Multimodal and cross-modal analysis are the only ways to use them at their best. Besides data analysis, this problem is also relevant to data description intended to help storage and mining. Interoperability and exchangeability of heterogeneous and distributed data is a need for any practical application. Semantics is information at the highest level, and inferring it from raw data (that is from information at the lowest level) entails exploiting both data and prior information to extract structure and meaning. Computation, machine learning, statistical and Bayesian methods are tools to achieve this goal at various levels.  
 The scope of IWCIM 2025 includes, but is not limited to the following topics:  
 Multisensor systems 
  Multimodal analysis 
  Crossmodal data analysis and clustering 
  Mixed-reality applications 
  Activity and object detection and recognition 
  Text and speech recognition 
  Multimedia labeling, semantic annotation and metadata 
  Multimodal indexing and searching in very large data-bases 
  Big and Linked Data 
  Search and mining Big Data 
  Large-scale recommendation systems 
  Multimedia and Multi-structured data 
  Cloud Optimization 
  Pervasive intelligence 
  Machine learning in multimedia understanding 
  Attention based approaches for multimedia understanding 
  Diffusion models for multi-modal data analysis 
  Multi-modal data analysis in compressed domain 
  Multi-modal data analysis for remote sensing applications 
  Semantic web and Linked data 
  Case studies

 Call for Papers ●  Cluster 2025  

 Download the CfP Document   
 IEEE Cluster 2025 is the 27th edition of the IEEE Cluster conference series. It is being held in cooperation with SIGHPC.  
 Computing clusters remain the primary system architecture for building many of today’s rapidly evolving computing infrastructures including high-performance computing, cloud computing, machine learning training and inference systems, and big data, and are used to solve some of the most complex problems. The challenges posed making them scalable, efficient, productive, and increasingly effective require community efforts in the areas of cluster system design, advancing the capabilities of the software stack, system management and monitoring, and the design of algorithms, methods, and applications to leverage the overall infrastructure.  
 For IEEE Cluster 2025, which will be held September 2-5, 2025 in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, we again solicit high-quality original work that advances the state-of-the-art in clusters and closely related fields.  
 All papers will be rigorously peer-reviewed for their originality, technical depth and correctness, potential impact, relevance to the conference, and quality of presentation. Generally research papers must clearly demonstrate novel research contributions, however papers reporting experiences are also welcome, but they must clearly describe the lessons learned and the resulting impact, along with the utility of the approach in comparison to previous work.  
 Authors must indicate the primary topic area of their submissions from the four topic areas provided below. In addition, they may optionally rank their paper relative to the overall set of topics. Transversal and emerging topics such as AI for HPC, HPC for AI, quantum computing, accelerators, and many others, are welcome within the respective areas even if they are not mentioned explicitly. Papers are limited to 10 pages, although references do not need to fit within this page limit.  
 IEEE Cluster 2025 follows a dual-anonymous  review process. For an explanation and description of this review process, please refer to the following link: https://clustercomp.org/2025/dual_anonymous.html   
 Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text   
 The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in a paper (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content.  
 The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is recommended.

 Developing the world’s first simulation of a full gas-turbine.  

 EPCC is leading this ambitious and challenging programme of research funded by EPSRC and Rolls-Royce, in partnership with the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, the University of Warwick and the University of Bristol.  
 By 2030, the goal is to work towards the “virtual certification” of aircraft engines by modelling gas turbines in operation. This requires a unique combination of fundamental engineering and computational science research to address a challenge that is well beyond the capabilities of today’s state of the art.

 Software collaborations with the UK Met Office  
 High resolution modelling of local atmospheric conditions to deliver high accuracy weather forecasts.  

 EPCC worked with the Met Office and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to redevelop the LEM model to enable a step change in capability. We ensured the code for the Met Office’s new atmospheric model—MONC—would run on large HPC machines and provide significant efficiency.  
 The model is now routinely used across the UK and wider world, with domains of up to 2.1 billion grid points having been modelled on over 32,768 cores of ARCHER (the UK’s previous national supercomputer service). There have been numerous scientific discoveries made with MONC that would have been untenable with previous-generation models.

 Exascale research  
 EPCC has been involved in various aspects of Exascale research for 10 years.  

 Overview of EPCC's Exascale activities  
 EPCC has been involved in research around the core issues of Exascale computing for over a decade. This "Computing in Science and Engineering" article summarises our efforts, ranging from investigating energy efficiency and programming language interoperability, to application performance and I/O solutions:  
 EPCC's Exascale journey: a retrospective of the past 10 years and a vision of the future 
  ExCALIBUR programme  
 The ExCALIBUR programme is a £45.7M initiative from the UK government’s Strategic Priorities Fund  (SPF) led by the Met Office  , UK Research and Innovation  (UKRI) with the UK Atomic Energy Authority  (UKAEA).  
 The aim is to prepare high priority applications for Exascale and progress cross-cutting domains such as algorithm design to maintain a leading position for the UK in high performance computing. Work is focussed on issues of strategic importance such as drug and vaccine research, climate and weather prediction, and fusion power and green energy sources.  
 EPCC is leading or co-leading the following ExCALIBUR collaborations:  
 The Materials and Molecular Modelling Exascale Design and Development Working Group 
  ELEMENT: the Exascale Mesh Network 
  EXALAT: Lattice Field Theory at the Exascale Frontier

 Exploring novel hardware architectures  
 EPCC researches how to exploit novel hardware in order to accelerate numerical and data intensive applications.  

 In recent research, we have explored novel hardware such as byte-addressable persistent memory to accelerate I/O intensive applications, Arm-based CPUs in order to assess the maturity of the surrounding software ecosystem, and FPGAs and AI-accelerator technologies to study alternative technologies to achieve high performance with high efficiency.

 Scope    

 The 45 th  IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss and exchange cutting edge ideas as well as the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will be held over July 20-23 rd  , 2025 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025.  

 Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:  

  Cloud Computing 

  Distributed Algorithms 

  Big Data, Models & Systems 

  Distributed Fault Tolerance 

  Distributed OS and Middleware 

  Edge Computing 

  IoT + CPS 

  Mobile Computing 

  Security, Privacy and Trust 

  Blockchains/Databases 

  Distributed Systems for AI/ML 

  AI/ML for Distributed Systems 

  Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures 

 Paper Submission   

 The Paper strand provides  the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.  

 Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template (downloadable by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE-Template Selector https://template-selector.ieee.org/  ). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages  (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.  

 The paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts and data needed for the reproduction of their results.  

 For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.  

 Note that the authors should adhere to ethic and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics  and IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text.   

 Note  : A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS)  . The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.

 The CNOM flagship conferences are the Network Operations and Management (NOMS) conference, previously named Integrated Management (IM) conference on odd-numbered years, and the Conference on Network and Systems Management (CNSM), a consolidation of the   DSOM, MMNS, IPOM, MACE and NGNM conferences/workshops previously held   during a Management Week (ManWeek) event.  CNOM generally supports “regional” network management conferences: APNOMS, held in the Asia-Pacific region and LANOMS, held in Latin America and AIMS in Europe. Finally, CNOM generally co-sponsors technical symposia in the Comsoc flagship conferences ICC and Globecom. Below are links to these events.
