 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 We will publish our proceedings with Springer as a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
 Authors are invited to submit original papers: they must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors have published elsewhere or have submitted in parallel to any other conferences that have proceedings or any journal. The submission must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references.  Original contributions are invited up to 16 pages  in length (single column) excluding appendices and bibliography and up to 20 pages in total, using at least 11-point fonts and with reasonable margins. Submissions not meeting the submission guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Detailed author instructions and LaTeX/Word templates for LNCS publications can be found via the following link:  
 Springer LNCS Author Information   
  
 Types of submissions:  
 Full Paper | : presenting novel and original research findings. Submissions must adhere to a maximum limit of 20 pages. 
  Short Paper | : presenting original work-in-progress, which has not yet reached the level of maturity required for a full paper. Short papers should be limited to 10 pages. The title of each short paper should start with the phrase "Extended Abstract." Accepted short papers be included in the conference proceedings. 
   
 Posters  
 Participating in NSS/SocialSec 2024 by presenting a poster offers a valuable opportunity for students and researchers to receive feedback on their ongoing work from knowledgeable participants at the conference. We encourage the submission of posters that present unpublished in-progress or late-breaking research, as well as extensions of published work on security and privacy topics. We also welcome posters showcasing interdisciplinary work that is relevant to security and privacy research but was published outside the security community.  
 Students/ researchers are invited to submit an abstract, along with a draft of the poster, describing their work for consideration. Abstracts should be no longer than two pages and must begin with the keyword "Poster:" The abstract should include all authors with their institutional affiliation and contact information. The abstract should briefly describe the problem being addressed and the approach taken. While providing preliminary results is suggested, it is not mandatory. If the work has been previously published outside the security community or is an extension of any published work, please include a reference to the existing publication.  
 Please submit your poster proposals in PDF format, using the 2-column Springer template. You can find the template at https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/conference-proceedings/conference-proceedings-guidelines. Remember, your proposal should include author information (name, affiliation, country) as it's not anonymous. The submission will be through EasyChair system.  
 NSS 2024 Submission Link  SocialSec 2024 Submission Link   
 If your proposal is accepted for the conference, you'll need to bring your finished poster and present it during one evening of the event. You'll set up your poster beforehand and stand with it for about 75 minutes. We'll email you details about the poster format before the conference. Typically, posters are attached to a 40x30 inch backing.  
 To present at the conference, you or someone representing you must register, pay the registration fee, and attend the event. Students can register at a reduced price, but everyone else, including conference organizers, must pay the full fee. You'll also need to either provide a link to your presentation or deliver a soft copy by the presentation date.  
 Workshops  
 NSS/SocialSec 2024 workshops cover current topics that attendees typically find valuable and engaging. They offer a dynamic platform for IT professionals like standards developers, software developers, security engineers, and security officers to share ideas, discuss concerns, and express opinions.  
 NSS/SocialSec workshop typically spans a half day, lasting around 3 to 4 hours, fostering interactive discussions among multiple presenters and participants. These workshops serve as a vibrant platform where members of the standards and software development communities engage in lively exchanges of ideas, opinions, and concerns related to the workshop topic.  
 It's important to note that NSS/SocialSec 2024 workshop is not:  
 A presentation of your research findings. 
  A broad overview of Computer Science topics. 
  An opportunity to promote or market a product or service. 
  The workshop submission doesn't require a fully developed workshop at the time of submission. However, you should have a clear outline of the workshop, including initial plans on how it will be conducted and how time will be allocated to each section. You don't need to include a general overview of computer security. Workshop submissions have a unique structure compared to papers or panel proposals. Here's how your workshop submission should be organized:  
 Title of the workshop 
  One to two paragraphs introducing the workshop and its objectives. 
  One to two pages outlining the workshop, including rough time estimates for each section. 
  Identification of the workshop author, including contact information such as mailing address, email, fax, and phone number. 
  One to two paragraphs providing biographical information about the workshop moderators. 
  This structured approach ensures clarity and coherence in presenting your workshop proposal.  
 Workshop submissions should be sent electronically to the Workshops Chair. Alternatively, you can submit via the following EasyChair links:  
 NSS 2024 Submission Link  SocialSec 2024 Submission Link   
 You can submit workshops in any of the following formats: Microsoft Word, Rich Text Format, or plain Text.  
 If your workshop is accepted, here's what you can expect:  
 By End-August: You'll need to submit an updated version of the workshop proposal for inclusion in the Advance Program. It's crucial that the workshop description is accurate, and the outline is correct. 
  By Mid-October: You'll need to provide another updated version of the proposal. This version should include additional information describing the major topics that will be covered during the workshop.

  Awards  
 Most Notable Paper Award 2024 (1) for 2011 | Recipients: Sean McDirmid 
  Title: Coding at the Speed of Touch 
  Conference: Onward! 2011 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2048237.2048246 
  Citation: This 2011 Onward! paper describes the design and implementation of YinYang, a graphical system providing a proficient programming experience for tablet devices with constrained screen space. YingYang’s tile-based approach sidestepped these devices’ limited text-editing capabilities and enabled an intuitive and effective form of direct manipulation. The work stands out as an emblematic Onward! contribution. It is notable for championing programmability on a class of traditionally “closed” devices, exploring many subtle design points of graphical and visual languages, and as a call to action for moving “beyond typewriters” and inspiring the next generation of programmers. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2024 (2) for 2012 | Recipients: Andrew P. Black, Kim B. Bruce, Michael Homer and James Noble 
  Title: Grace: the Absence of (Inessential) Difficulty 
  Conference: Onward! 2012 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2384592.2384601 
  Citation: In this Onward! 2012 paper, the authors distilled a tremendous effort to accommodate the needs of programming pedagogy in a new language design. The paper is a model of clarity, deftly justifying its choices while also situating Grace within the rich history of programming languages past and present. It has supported and inspired considerable follow-on work, not only on pedagogy but also in programming language research topics such as gradual typing and the semantics of object-orientation. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2023 for 2013 | Recipients: Sean McDirmid 
  Title: Usable Live Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2013 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2509578.2509585 
  Citation: This paper revitalized the study of live programming, introducing mechanisms that are now standard techniques in the field. The paper epitomizes the spirit of Onward!, asking risky questions outside the current discourse. In its form the paper was a breath of fresh air, enlivened by the use of comic strips. The work marked the beginning of a rich seam of research that has been productively mined at the ongoing LIVE workshop series at SPLASH. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2020 for 2010 | Recipients: Lennart C. L. Kats, Eelco Visser, and Guido Wachsmuth 
  Title: Pure and Declarative Syntax Definition: Paradise Lost and Regained 
  Conference: Onward! 2010 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869459.1869535 
  Citation: In a beautiful and compelling exposition, this essay lays out a research vision for realizing a declarative approach to syntax definition. Considering how we can best capture the syntactic structure of a programming language is a question near to the heart of both language design and implementation. The essay is technically interesting without getting lost in formality. Its argument for the declarative paradigm has been influential, impacting a chain of research on declarative syntax tools and helping to usher in the recent era of polyglot programming. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2019 for 2009 | Recipient: William R. Cook 
  Title: On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited 
  Conference: Onward! 2009 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1640133 
  Citation: The 2009 Onward! essay “On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited” compares abstract data types and objects as two forms of data abstraction. In particular, the paper describes many points of differences and similarities between them clearly and comprehensively. The paper is not only most notable for summarizing a long history of discussions, but also for letting many programming language designers reflect on this topic again. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2018 for 2008 | Recipient: Richard P. Gabriel 
  Title: Designed as Designer 
  Conference: Onward! 2008 
  Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1449813 
  Citation: The 2008 Onward! essay “Designed as Designer” examines the nature of creativity and design, exploring poetry, architecture and software. In particular, the paper sets out to explore questions about our self-conception as computer scientists and programmers. This paper is notable for paving the way for a new track that became Essays at Onward!. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2017 for 2007 | Recipient: Sean McDirmid 
  Title: Living it up with a Live Programming Language 
  Conference: Onward! 2007 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297073 
  Citation: The 2007 Onward! paper “Living it up with a Live Programming Language” brought the idea of Live Programming into focus by examining the necessary mechanisms, developing a good running example, displaying a contrarian attitude, and explaining it all with admirably clear writing. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2016 for 2006 | Recipient: Friedrich Steimann 
  Title: The Paradoxical Success of Aspect-Oriented Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2006 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1167514 
  Citation: The 2006 Onward! Essay “The Paradoxical Success of Aspect-Oriented Programming” presents a considered and articulated exploration of the nature of aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In particular, the paper takes a hard look at the value proposed for AOP, together with an examination of what is achieved and what sacrifices appear to be necessary. The paper does not attack AOP, but rather takes a sober look at the hopes and the fears. In doing so, the paper provides a careful review that might also form the basis for progress, even if the form of progress might differ from the original promise. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2015 for 2005 | Recipient: Jonathan Edwards 
  Title: Subtext—Uncovering the Simplicity of Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2005 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094811.1094851 
  Citation: The 2005 Onward! paper “Subtext—Uncovering the Simplicity of Programming” presented a new kind of programming, unifying programs and their execution, and which helped establish Onward! as a forum for high-end, lateral thinking about programming. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2014 for 2004 | Recipient: Tim Sheard 
  Title: Languages of the Future 
  Conference: Onward! 2004 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1052883.1052897 
  Citation: The 2004 Onward! paper “Languages of the Future” pioneered the idea of lightweight dependently-typed programming, and idea that has since found its way into several languages, and continues to progress today. This paper is notable for bringing together complex ideas in a compelling way; pointing to how they could be incorporated into “ordinary” languages; and influencing the practical world of software development with this pearl of a design. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2013 for 2003 | Recipient: Martin Rinard 
  Title: Acceptability-oriented Computing 
  Conference: Onward! 2003 
  Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=949344.949402 
  Citation: The 2003 Onward! paper “Acceptability-Oriented Computing” introduced the approach of defining the boundaries of acceptable program behavior for a software system, and then augmenting the original system by layering components to enforce those boundaries—this instead of attempting to construct a completely error-free system. This paper led to a still-expanding series of papers exploring this approach, its capabilities and its benefits. 
  Most Notable Paper Award 2012 for 2002 | Recipients: James Noble and Robert Biddle 
  Title: Notes on Postmodern Programming 
  Conference: Onward! 2002 
  Paper: | http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/Onward!Proceedings-2002.pdf 
  Citation: The 2002 Onward! paper “Notes on Postmodern Programming” uses postmodern concepts to understand contemporary programming, especially as software grows in scale and design is dispersed to a diversity of stakeholders. This paper is notable because it triggered a storm of immediate responses and ongoing discussion on the Web; it introduced the essay genre to the programming community and cut the path that led to a new technical track at Onward! (Essays); and it stated for the first time the philosophical model of at-scale software development that dominates today.

 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  Call for Papers 
  Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward!   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2023papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  Call for Papers 
  Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward!   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2023papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  Introduction   
 The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  
 OOPSLA 2025 will have two rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline October 15, 2024  and Round 2 submission deadline March 25, 2025  (AoE). All deadlines are firm. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.  
 What’s New   
 There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:  
 Reserve Reviewer Policy 
  Data-Availability Statement 
  Contact   
 You can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email:  
 oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com    Please use this address, not  their personal email addresses, unless  you think they are not getting your messages. Please allow 1–2 working days for a response before assuming they didn’t see your message, and longer right around deadlines.  
 In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one). That makes it easier to track the context (and avoids ambiguity).  
 Review Process   
 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.  
 At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:  
 Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Reject  : Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.  
 Conditional Accept  : While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.  
 Minor Revision  : While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.  
 Major Revision  : While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.  
 If you receive one of the latter three decisions, please note:  
 If you choose to submit a revised paper, you must also submit both (a) a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and (b) unless impossible, a diff of the PDFs. Independent of the decision, you can submit at the next deadline (either the opening deadline of the next round or the revision deadline of the current round). To the extent possible, your submission will be reviewed by the same reviewers. 
  Unless you explicitly withdraw your paper, it is considered under review  . Therefore, it would violate policy to submit it elsewhere. If you choose to withdraw the paper (e.g., to submit elsewhere), the next time you submit it, it will be treated as a fresh paper: you may get entirely different reviewers, previous reviews and comments will not be available, etc. 
  Until your paper is accepted or rejected, you should maintain the anonymity of your submission. If you believe you need to violate it to respond to the reviews, please first discuss this with the Chairs. 
  If the Artifact Evaluation submission deadline occurs before the decision date, you will be invited to submit artifacts. However, acceptance of artifacts has no impact on the acceptance of the revised papers. 
  Reserve Reviewer Policy   
 To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS  .  
 Instructions  : Log into TPMS with the same email address as for your HotCRP account. The system will ask you to upload (or provide URLs for) 5-10 of your previous papers, to base your matching on. Uploading papers/URLs is pretty straightforward; here’s also a step-by-step video  . You get to choose which papers you want to upload; these determine what papers you are most likely to be asked to review. So please go for both depth and breadth. In particular, please provide papers on topics for which you are a relatively rare expert.  
  
 The goal of this policy is to uphold the high standard of reviews within the SIGPLAN community. To achieve this, we must ensure manageable review loads, prevent burnout, and encourage reviewers to stay engaged for future rounds. High-quality reviews are one of the community’s greatest assets, playing a crucial role in elevating the quality of research for everyone.  
 Our hope is that these reserve reviewers won’t be needed at all! They will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our projections fall significantly short. Even in that case, their review load will be far lighter than that of RC members, and we will do our best to assign papers that closely match expertise (hence the need for TPMS registration).  
 We define “senior” authors as those who completed their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer policy if:  
 The paper has no senior authors. 
  At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference. 
  Every | senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria: | is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before); 
  is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year; 
  has some other exceptional circumstance that didn’t prevent writing the paper but prevents doing any reviewing. This must be cleared at least three days before submission with the RC Chairs. 
  It is okay for one person to serve as the reserve reviewer for more than one paper. Please enter their information for each such paper (preferably identically).  
 Submissions   
 Template   
 SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the SIGPLAN author information  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  
 Page Limit   
 Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material (such as appendices). However, papers must be self-contained; reviewers are under no obligation to read the supplementary material.  
 Revisions can go up to a maximum of 25 pages  . This includes papers given a minor or major revision in 2024, as well as the final, camera-ready papers. For fairness, there will not be an option to purchase additional pages. For the final paper, we ask you to stick as closely as possible to the final version accepted by reviewers, and only add material that reviewers requested.  
 Anonymity   
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymize supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Novelty   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  
 Data-Availability Statement   
 To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled Data-Availability Statement  in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit, but please limit it to at most a few paragraphs (usually one paragraph suffices).  
 In it, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section should ideally also include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on that reviewers may find useful (but are not obliged to follow). The statement is not meant to be a detailed description of how to use  the artifact; that should accompany the artifact itself.  
 It is understood that some papers have no artifacts but, given the broad range of what constitutes an artifact, it would be helpful to readers to explain why the paper has none.  
 Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain why they did not do so.  
 Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper.  
 Procedure   
 Please submit using HotCRP  .  
 Publication   
 PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.  
 The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than April 1, 2025, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than October 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID iD  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has made a commitment to collecting ORCID iDs from all of our published authors  . ORCID iDs help improve author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID iD will help in these efforts.  
 The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  
 Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process 
  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors 
  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship 
  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details 
  You can find the updated policy here  .  
 FAQ   
 What are reviewers looking for?   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology, and results clearly.  
 How are papers from previous years handled?   
 We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we try to assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) we strongly discourage reviewers from giving another “major revision” decision.  
 Are artifacts required?   
 No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the nature of the paper’s content and claims suggest there ought to be an artifact, authors must explain why they will not be providing one. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.  
 Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   
 Yes. Sometimes artifacts are rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the research results (e.g., packaging issues).  
 What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity completely undiscoverable (e.g., if a reviewer does a Web search for the text of your paper) but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without knowing who you are. This includes omitting your names from your title page, and referring to your own work in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]”, you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. It is best to suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.  
 Should I change the name of my system?   
 No. However, if it is not a new system and is likely to be known to others, you should refer to it as if it were created by a third party, rather than as your own creation.  
 My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 Cite the code in your paper, but replace the URL with text like “link removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper. Should I anonymize reference to that work?   
 Yes, you should treat it like any other anonymization. But you should also change the title of the paper to break a direct link between the two.  
 Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?   
 We want to help you navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs. When in doubt about any of these guidelines, please first check in with the Review Committee Chairs: better safe than sorry. (If the Chairs give you permission, they can then also address any subsequent complaints about those actions from reviewers.)  
 Things you may  do:  
 Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not  do  :  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings. For example, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post with paper details to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them.

 Welcome to the website of the joint ICFP/SPLASH 2025 conference!  
 For the first time, the two leading SIGPLAN venues—ICFP and SPLASH—will be co-located in Singapore in 2025:  
 ICFP 2025  : The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) is an annual programming language conference that provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries. 
  SPLASH 2025  : The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery, to make it the premier conference on the applications of programming languages - at the intersection of programming languages and software engineering. 
  We couldn’t be more excited to host academics and practitioners from all around the globe in one of the most vibrant and safe cities in the world!

 Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA)  
  OOPSLA (Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications) is now part of SPLASH (Systems, Programming Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity).  
 The SPLASH Steering Committee  serves as the OOPSLA Steering Committee.  
 The scope of OOPSLA includes all aspects of programming languages and software engineering, broadly construed. Papers that address any aspect of software development are welcome, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems. Papers may address these topics in a variety of ways, including new tools (such as languages, program analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and management techniques), and new evaluations (such as formalisms and proofs, corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).  
 Most Influential OOPSLA Paper Award  Each year a “Most Influential” OOPSLA paper is chosen and an presentation is made at OOPSLA. More details about this award and past winning papers can be found here  . SIGPLAN also makes several other awards including an “Outstanding Dissertation Award.” Please consider making a nomination for one of these awards. More details about the SIGPLAN awards can be found here  .

  Introduction   
 The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  
 OOPSLA 2025 will have two rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline October 15, 2024  and Round 2 submission deadline March 25, 2025  (AoE). All deadlines are firm. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.  
 What’s New   
 There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:  
 Reserve Reviewer Policy 
  Data-Availability Statement 
  Contact   
 You can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email:  
 oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com    Please use this address, not  their personal email addresses, unless  you think they are not getting your messages. Please allow 1–2 working days for a response before assuming they didn’t see your message, and longer right around deadlines.  
 In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one). That makes it easier to track the context (and avoids ambiguity).  
 Review Process   
 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.  
 At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:  
 Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Reject  : Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.  
 Conditional Accept  : While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.  
 Minor Revision  : While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.  
 Major Revision  : While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.  
 If you receive one of the latter three decisions, please note:  
 If you choose to submit a revised paper, you must also submit both (a) a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and (b) unless impossible, a diff of the PDFs. Independent of the decision, you can submit at the next deadline (either the opening deadline of the next round or the revision deadline of the current round). To the extent possible, your submission will be reviewed by the same reviewers. 
  Unless you explicitly withdraw your paper, it is considered under review  . Therefore, it would violate policy to submit it elsewhere. If you choose to withdraw the paper (e.g., to submit elsewhere), the next time you submit it, it will be treated as a fresh paper: you may get entirely different reviewers, previous reviews and comments will not be available, etc. 
  Until your paper is accepted or rejected, you should maintain the anonymity of your submission. If you believe you need to violate it to respond to the reviews, please first discuss this with the Chairs. 
  If the Artifact Evaluation submission deadline occurs before the decision date, you will be invited to submit artifacts. However, acceptance of artifacts has no impact on the acceptance of the revised papers. 
  Reserve Reviewer Policy   
 To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS  .  
 Instructions  : Log into TPMS with the same email address as for your HotCRP account. The system will ask you to upload (or provide URLs for) 5-10 of your previous papers, to base your matching on. Uploading papers/URLs is pretty straightforward; here’s also a step-by-step video  . You get to choose which papers you want to upload; these determine what papers you are most likely to be asked to review. So please go for both depth and breadth. In particular, please provide papers on topics for which you are a relatively rare expert.  
  
 The goal of this policy is to uphold the high standard of reviews within the SIGPLAN community. To achieve this, we must ensure manageable review loads, prevent burnout, and encourage reviewers to stay engaged for future rounds. High-quality reviews are one of the community’s greatest assets, playing a crucial role in elevating the quality of research for everyone.  
 Our hope is that these reserve reviewers won’t be needed at all! They will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our projections fall significantly short. Even in that case, their review load will be far lighter than that of RC members, and we will do our best to assign papers that closely match expertise (hence the need for TPMS registration).  
 We define “senior” authors as those who completed their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer policy if:  
 The paper has no senior authors. 
  At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference. 
  Every | senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria: | is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before); 
  is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year; 
  has some other exceptional circumstance that didn’t prevent writing the paper but prevents doing any reviewing. This must be cleared at least three days before submission with the RC Chairs. 
  It is okay for one person to serve as the reserve reviewer for more than one paper. Please enter their information for each such paper (preferably identically).  
 Submissions   
 Template   
 SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the SIGPLAN author information  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  
 Page Limit   
 Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material (such as appendices). However, papers must be self-contained; reviewers are under no obligation to read the supplementary material.  
 Revisions can go up to a maximum of 25 pages  . This includes papers given a minor or major revision in 2024, as well as the final, camera-ready papers. For fairness, there will not be an option to purchase additional pages. For the final paper, we ask you to stick as closely as possible to the final version accepted by reviewers, and only add material that reviewers requested.  
 Anonymity   
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymize supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Novelty   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  
 Data-Availability Statement   
 To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled Data-Availability Statement  in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit, but please limit it to at most a few paragraphs (usually one paragraph suffices).  
 In it, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section should ideally also include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on that reviewers may find useful (but are not obliged to follow). The statement is not meant to be a detailed description of how to use  the artifact; that should accompany the artifact itself.  
 It is understood that some papers have no artifacts but, given the broad range of what constitutes an artifact, it would be helpful to readers to explain why the paper has none.  
 Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain why they did not do so.  
 Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper.  
 Procedure   
 Please submit using HotCRP  .  
 Publication   
 PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.  
 The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than April 1, 2025, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than October 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 ACM Policies   
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID iD  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has made a commitment to collecting ORCID iDs from all of our published authors  . ORCID iDs help improve author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID iD will help in these efforts.  
 The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  
 Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process 
  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors 
  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship 
  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details

 What are reviewers looking for?   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology, and results clearly.  
 How are papers from previous years handled?   
 We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we try to assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) we strongly discourage reviewers from giving another “major revision” decision.  
 Are artifacts required?   
 No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the nature of the paper’s content and claims suggest there ought to be an artifact, authors must explain why they will not be providing one. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.  
 Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   
 Yes. Sometimes artifacts are rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the research results (e.g., packaging issues).  
 What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity completely undiscoverable (e.g., if a reviewer does a Web search for the text of your paper) but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without knowing who you are. This includes omitting your names from your title page, and referring to your own work in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]”, you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. It is best to suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.  
 Should I change the name of my system?   
 No. However, if it is not a new system and is likely to be known to others, you should refer to it as if it were created by a third party, rather than as your own creation.  
 My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   
 Cite the code in your paper, but replace the URL with text like “link removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper. Should I anonymize reference to that work?   
 Yes, you should treat it like any other anonymization. But you should also change the title of the paper to break a direct link between the two.  
 Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?   
 We want to help you navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs. When in doubt about any of these guidelines, please first check in with the Review Committee Chairs: better safe than sorry. (If the Chairs give you permission, they can then also address any subsequent complaints about those actions from reviewers.)  
 Things you may  do:  
 Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not  do  :  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings. For example, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post with paper details to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them.

   Conference Call for Papers  
 he 2024 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on New Ideas, New Paradigms, and Reflections on Programming and Software (Onward! 2024), the premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software, including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.   
 Overview  
 Top Research Topics at SIGPLAN symposium on New ideas, new paradigms, and reflections on programming and software?  
 Programming language (43.15%) 
  Software (17.26%) 
  Software engineering (12.69%) 
  Programming language, Software, Software engineering, Programming paradigm and World Wide Web are among the topics commonly tackled in SIGPLAN symposium on New ideas, new paradigms, and reflections on programming and software. Concepts in Theoretical computer science, as well as related topics in Object (computer science), are covered in the Programming language research presented in the conference.

 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups:  
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
  Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
  Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
  Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
  Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500).

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modelling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  
 OOPSLA 2024 will have two separate rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline on the 20th of October 2023  (note that SPLASH/OOPSLA 2023  is 22-27 October 2023) and the Round 2 submission deadline on the 5th of April 2024 (Anywhere on Earth)   .  
 In each round, papers will have a final outcome of Accept, Revise, or Reject—see Review Process for details. Papers accepted at either of the rounds will be published in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to be presented at the SPLASH conference in October 2024.  
 Review Process   
 PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing with submission deadlines around October and April each year. As you submit your paper you will receive around three reviews and an opportunity to provide an author response that will be read and addressed by the reviewers in the final decision outcome summary. There are 5 possible outcomes at the end of the round:  
 Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  
 Conditional Accept  : You will receive a list of required revisions that you will need to address. You must submit a revised paper, a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and — if possible — a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. Assuming you meet the listed requirements, after further review by the same reviewers, your paper will very likely be accepted. This process has to be completed within two months of the initial decision  for the paper to be accepted, so we encourage timely turnaround in case revisions take more than one cycle to be accepted. Please note that when resubmitting the paper for a conditional accept review it should remain anonymous until fully accepted.  
 Minor Revision  : The reviewers have concerns that go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Therefore, while you may receive a list of revisions suggested by the reviewers, this will not necessarily be comprehensive. You will have the opportunity to resubmit your revised paper and have it re-reviewed by the same reviewers, which may or may not result in your paper’s acceptance. When you resubmit, you should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers, by including a document describing the changes and — if possible — a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. This process has to be completed within two months of the initial decision  for the paper to be accepted in the current round, so we encourage timely turnaround in case revisions take more than one cycle to be accepted. Please note that when resubmitting the paper for a minor revision review it should remain anonymous until fully accepted.  
 IMPORTANT NOTE FROM AEC:  A minor revision is also invited to submit the artefact in case the paper is accepted for this year’s publication. Note that AEC and OOPSLA RC are different sets of people, so the paper will remain blinded to the OOPSLA RC reviewers.  
 Major Revision  : You will receive a list of revisions suggested by the reviewers. Papers in this category are invited to submit a revision to the next round of submissions  with a specific set of expectations to be met. When you resubmit, you should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers, by including a document describing the changes and — if possible — a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. The revised paper will be re-evaluated in the next round. Resubmitted papers will retain the same reviewers throughout the process to the extent possible. Please note that when resubmitting the paper for a major revision review in the next round it should remain anonymous.  
 IMPORTANT NOTE FROM SIGPLAN:  A major revision decision also says that the paper is considered under submission to OOPSLA and cannot be resubmitted elsewhere unless the paper is explicitly withdrawn from consideration for OOPSLA.  
 Reject  : Rejected papers will not be included in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Papers in this category are not guaranteed a review if resubmitted less than one year from the date of the original submission. A paper will be judged to be a resubmission if it is substantially similar to the original submission. The Chairs will decide whether or not a paper is a resubmission of the same work.  
 Submissions   
 Submitted papers (including resubmissions) must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. The references do not count towards this limit. No appendices are allowed on the main paper, instead, authors can upload supplementary material with no page or content restrictions, but reviewers may choose to ignore it. The PACMPL templates used for SPLASH (Microsoft Word and LaTeX) and the instructions for their use can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  
 As of late 2023, the ACM LaTeX Template was located here  with the relevant file in the samples folder and called sample-acmsmall.tex .  
 Papers may use either numeric or author-year citations. In LaTeX, use \citestyle{acmauthoryear} to select author-year citations; nothing needs to be done to use numeric citations, which are the default.  
 PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must  
 omit author names and institutions, 
  use the third person when referencing your work, 
  anonymise supplementary material. 
  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the DBR FAQ. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  
 Artifacts   
 Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. Please note that the artifact submission deadline will be following closely the paper notification deadline so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper to PACMPL(OOPSLA).   
 Data-Availability Statement   
 To help readers find data and software, OOPSLA recommends adding a section just before the references titled Data-Availability Statement  . If the paper has an artifact, cite it here. If there is no artifact, this section can explain how to obtain relevant code. The statement does not count  toward the OOPSLA 2023 page limit. It may be included in the submitted paper, in fact we encourage this, even if the DOI is not ready yet.  
 Example:   
 \section{Conclusion} .... \section*{Data-Availability Statement} The software that supports~\cref{s:design,s:evaluation} is available on Software Heritage~\cite{artifact-swh} and Zenodo~\cite{artifact-doi}. \begin{acks} ....  Expert PC Members   
 During the submission, we will ask you to list up to 3 non-conflicted PC members who you think are experts on the topic of this submission, starting with the most expert. This list will not be used as an input during the paper assignment and it will not be visible to the PC. It may be used by the PC Chair and Associate Chairs for advice on external experts if the paper lacks expert reviews.  
 Publication   
 PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, all papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge ($400 USD), but payment is not required. The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library.  
 The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than the 1st of April 2024, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than the 1st of October 2024. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  
 Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process 
  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors 
  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship 
  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details 
  You can find the updated policy here:  
 https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship   
 Camera Ready Requirements   
 The page limit for the camera-ready version is 27 pages plus references  (note the 4-page increase compared to the reviewed version to accommodate any further changes requested by the reviewers), there are no page charges for this extension to 27 pages excluding references.  
 We prefer if the authors stay within the original reviewed 23 page limit as that was fully reviewed and go over the limit only if requested by the reviewers. We allow this increase to be applied to accepted papers, as well as conditionally accepted and minor revision papers as part of the resubmission. This increase does not normally apply to the major revisions.   
 FAQ   
 Selection Criteria   
 We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  
 Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  
 Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  
 Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.  
 Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.  
 Papers Resubmitted from previous year OOPSLA R2 to this year OOPSLA R1   
 Q: What process is followed for “major revisions” papers between different years? We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) getting another “major revision” is not an option given to the reviewers.  
 Artifacts   
 Q: Are artifacts required? No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. But if an artifact is not provided when the claims in the paper refer to an artifact, the authors must explain why their work is not available for repetition.  
 Q: Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected? Yes! The reasons for rejecting an artifact are multiple and often stem from the quality of the packaging.  
 Double-Blinding Submissions (Authors)   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper? Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity.  
 Q: Should I change the name of my system? No.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this? Cite the code in your paper, but remove the URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  
 Q: I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper, should I anonymize reference to that work? No. But we recommend you do not use the same title so that it clearly distinguishes the papers.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv? send it to colleagues? give a talk about it? on social media? We have developed guidelines to help navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs.  
 Things you may do  :  
 Put your submission on your home page. 
  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. 
  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. 
  Things you should not do  :  
 Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Review Committee Chairs. 

 Speakers and Session Chairs  
   
 Session Chair Instructions   
 Please assemble in the room at least 15 minutes before the session starts, ensure that at least one presenter is present for each paper, and have at least one question ready for each paper in case there are none from the audience. We advise you to look at or read the papers in your session! Please get in touch with the RC chairs via email or other means if any of the presenters are missing 10 minutes before the start of the session.  
 Presenter/Speaker Instructions   
 Please be at the designated room 15 minutes before your entire session starts to check your AV equipment setup and introduce yourself to the session chair. Your slot is 20 minutes long, which means we expect your talk to last only 15 minutes and leave 5 minutes for Q&A chaired by the session chair. Please remember to fill out this form  if you are presenting!

 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  
 The Character of Onward! Papers   
 Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.  
 Selection Process   
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.  
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.  
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.  
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.  
 Instructions for Authors   
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.  
 Submission Site   
 https://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/   
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.  
 Policy on Double Blind Review   
 Onward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:  
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
  To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
  To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
  After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.  
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.  
 Policy on Authorship Changes   
 Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.  
 Format   
 Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format  and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.  
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

  More 

 SIURO consists of articles written by undergraduate students in applied and computational mathematics, offering an opportunity for students to publish research they have completed as part of their undergraduate education and providing undergraduates incentives for conducting research.  
 The publication represents a wide range of applied topics, including but not limited to analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics, operations research, optimization, dynamical systems, modeling, and computation. Typical areas of application include but are not limited to physical, life, financial, and management sciences and engineering.  
 Each paper must be submitted with a letter from a project advisor. Faculty advisers or sponsors are listed as "project advisor" on the published paper.  
 SIURO provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to share their results and experience a full paper review process. High school students may also submit their work.  
 The project advisor may be a faculty member at the student’s institution or at an institution the student is visiting, or someone associated with a non-academic organization or government lab who supervised the research. 
  The project advisor’s letter must document the fact that the research was done while the student was an undergraduate and list the student’s graduation date or anticipated graduation date. 
  Project advisors will be listed separately from the authors with a “project advisor” byline.

Given the travel uncertainties around the current Corona crisis, we wanted to reassure everyone that any possible paper at OpenSym that might result from a submission is safe: We guarantee the publication of the proceedings, including all accepted papers, in the ACM digital library. Our strategy is straightforward: If travel is not possible, we will let you participate online. If online is not possible, we will simply create the proceedings and provide accepted authors with their publication. So, nothing should stop you from submitting to OpenSym 2020  !

 Sentiment Analysis of Open Source Communities: An Exploratory Study   
 March 4, 2020    Conference Contributions  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions  , Short Research Papers   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  Sentiment Analysis of Open Source Communities: An Exploratory Study  
 Authors:  Jennifer Ferreira (National University of Ireland, Galway), Michael Glynn (Intel Shannon), David Hunt (Intel Shannon), Jaganath Babu (National University of Ireland, Galway), Denis Dennehy (National University of Ireland, Galway), Kieran Conboy (National University of Ireland, Galway)  
 Abstract:  Open Source Software (OSS) mailing lists have become popular targets for mining sentiment and emotions, as they provide a centralized communication hub between the distributed OSS community. Sentiment and emotions within communities can provide insights into how a community responds to certain events, who are the key members and how their behaviours impact the rest of the community. Such insights can inform initiatives aimed at fostering positive interactions between OSS community members, strengthening social ties, and helping the community accomplish its tasks. This poster presents our initial results from sentiment analysis of an OSS mailing list, and answers two key questions: (1) Given that the mailing list is used for peer-review of code, is the community sentiment negative overall? (2) Is community sentiment related to the month of the release cycle?

 Open Data Collaborations – A Snapshot of an Emerging Practice   
 March 3, 2020    Conference Contributions  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions  , Short Research Papers   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  Open Data Collaborations – A Snapshot of an Emerging Practice  
 Authors:  Thomas Olsson (RISE Research Institutes of Sweden), Per Runeson (Lund University)  
 Abstract:  Data defined software is becoming more and more prevalent, especially with the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence. With data defined systems come both challenges – to continue to collect and maintain quality data – and opportunities – open innovation by sharing with others. We propose Open Data Collaboration (ODC) to describe pecuniary and non-pecuniary sharing of open data, similar to Open Source Software. To understand challenges and opportunities with ODC, we ran focus groups with 22 companies and organizations. We observed an interest in the subject, but we conclude that the overall maturity is low and ODC is rare.

 Title:  The Classification and Potential of Business Archetypes by Using Open Data  
 Authors:  Run Duan (Guangdong University of Technology), Tetsuo Noda (Shimane University)  
 Abstract:  Public data collected or possessed by administrative agencies and subsequently released as Open Data is expected to bring about positive economic effects. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the business archetypes of using Open Data to establish whether this expectation holds true, and to classify Open Data business archetypes into 7 types to predict their commercial potential.

 What We Talk About When We Talk About Wikidata Quality: A Literature Survey   
 February 28, 2020    Conference Contributions  , Full Research Papers  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  What We Talk About When We Talk About Wikidata Quality: A Literature Survey  
 Authors:  Alessandro Piscopo (University of Southampton), Elena Simperl (University of Southampton)  
 Abstract:  Launched in 2012, Wikidata has already become a success story. It is a collaborative knowledge graph, whose large community has produced so far data about more than 55 million entities. Understanding the quality of the data in Wikidata is key to its widespread adoption and future development. No study has investigated so far to what extent and which aspects of this topic have been addressed. To fill this gap, we surveyed prior literature about data quality in Wikidata. Our analysis includes 28 papers and categorise by quality dimensions addressed. We showed that a number of quality dimensions has not been yet adequately covered, e.g. accuracy and trustworthiness. Future work should focus on these.

 When Humans and Machines Collaborate: Cross-lingual Label Editing in Wikidata   
 February 27, 2020    Conference Contributions  , Full Research Papers  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  When Humans and Machines Collaborate: Cross-lingual Label Editing in Wikidata  
 Authors:  Lucie-Aimée Ka ffee (University of Southampton and TIB Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology), Kemele M Endris (TIB Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology), Elena Simperl (University of Southampton)  
 Abstract:  The quality and maintainability of a knowledge graph are determined by the process in which it is created. There are different approaches to such processes; extraction or conversion of available data in the web (automated extraction of knowledge such as DBpedia from Wikipedia), community-created knowledge graphs, often by a group of experts, and hybrid approaches where humans maintain the knowledge graph alongside bots. We focus in this work on the hybrid approach of human edited knowledge graphs supported by automated tools. In particular, we analyse the editing of natural language data, i.e. labels. Labels are the entry point for humans to understand the information, and therefore need to be carefully maintained. We take a step toward the understanding of collaborative editing of humans and automated tools across languages in a knowledge graph. We use Wikidata as it has a large and active community of humans and bots working together covering over 300 languages. In this work, we analyse the different editor groups and how they interact with the different language data to understand the provenance of the current label data.

 Approving Automation: Analyzing Requests for Permissions of Bots in Wikidata   
 February 26, 2020    Conference Contributions  , Full Research Papers  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  Approving Automation: Analyzing Requests for Permissions of Bots in Wikidata  
 Authors:  Mariam Farda-Sarbas (Freie Universitat Berlin), Hong Zhu (Freie Universität Berlin), Marisa Nest (Freie Universität Berlin), Claudia Muller-Birn (Freie Universität Berlin)  
 Abstract:  Wikidata, initially developed to serve as a central structured knowledge base for Wikipedia, is now a melting point for structured data for companies, research projects and other peer production communities. Wikidata’s community consists of humans and bots, and most edits in Wikidata come from these bots. Prior research has raised concerns regarding the challenges for editors to ensure the quality of bot-generated data, such as the lack of quality control and knowledge diversity. In this research work, we provide one way of tackling these challenges by taking a closer look at the approval process of bot activity on Wikidata. We collected all bot requests, i.e. requests for permissions (RfP) from October 2012 to July 2018. We analyzed these 683 bot requests by classifying them regarding activity focus, activity type, and source mentioned. Our results show that the majority of task requests deal with data additions to Wikidata from internal sources, especially from Wikipedia. However, we can also show the existing diversity of external sources used so far. Furthermore, we examined the reasons which caused the unsuccessful closing of RfPs. In some cases, the Wikidata community is reluctant to implement specific bots, even if they are urgently needed because there is still no agreement in the community regarding the technical implementation. This study can serve as a foundation for studies that connect the approved tasks with the editing behavior of bots on Wikidata to understand the role of bots better for quality control and knowledge diversity.

 Dwelling on Wikipedia: Investigating Time Spent by Global Encyclopedia Readers   
 February 25, 2020    Conference Contributions  , Full Research Papers  , OpenSym 2019  , Proceedings  , Research Contributions   Agnes Low     
  
 Title:  Dwelling on Wikipedia: Investigating Time Spent by Global Encyclopedia Readers  
 Authors:  Nathan TeBlunthuis (Wikimedia Foundation), Tilman Bayer (Wikimedia Foundation), Olga Vasileva (Wikimedia Foundation)  
 Abstract:  Much existing knowledge about global consumption of peer-produced information goods is supported by data on Wikipedia page view counts and surveys. In 2017, the Wikimedia Foundation began measuring the time readers spend on a given page view (dwell time), enabling a more detailed understanding of such reading patterns. In this paper, we validate and model this new data source and, building on existing findings, use regression analysis to test hypotheses about how patterns in reading time vary between global contexts. Consistent with prior findings from self-report data, our complementary analysis of behavioral data provides evidence that Global South readers are more likely to use Wikipedia to gain in-depth understanding of a topic. We find that Global South readers spend more time per page view and that this difference is amplified on desktop devices, which are thought to be better suited for in-depth information seeking tasks.

  In 2022, the 18th International Conference on Open Source Systems (OSS) and the 18th International Symposium on Open Collaboration (OpenSym) are joining forces and will be held as co-located events.  
 The goal of bringing these two communities together is to make it a holistic forum encompassing all topics related to open collaboration research and practice, including open source, open data, open science, open education, wikis, and related social media, Wikipedia, and IT-driven open innovation research.  
 Open collaboration emerged as one of the most important phenomena in the last decades. More recently, we saw how this global openness helped to respond to an international crisis, the Covid-19 crisis. Researchers from all over the world gathered efforts to find how to manage the pandemic. Synergies have been created, data opened and shared, knowledge disseminated, in order to accelerate research on vaccines and understand the virus behavior.  
 Following this historical situation, we decided to put this edition under the theme:  
 “Openness in Emergency Situations”  
 Open science is at the heart of this theme, including open data and open source tools that enabled this large-scale collaboration. We are interested in understanding cases and research that explore questions like: How “open” can benefit the society in emergency situations? What are the risks assigned to it? What are the processes, tools, and methods implemented to support openness?  
 More broadly, this year more than ever, our conference is about collaborations between people from computer science, information science, management, social science, humanities, and everyone interested in open collaboration and how it is helping and changing the world.  
 How will the CFP and Proceedings work?  
 While we will have a shared program, a single theme, and the same deadlines, we will keep two separate proceedings  . The goal is to keep the specifics of each of the communities in terms of archive and history. Therefore, formatting details and topics of interest are individual to each conference/symposium.  
 The intersection point between these two communities is the topics related to Open Source Software. Therefore, we encourage the authors of papers that touch this specific topic to submit to the OSS Conference.  
 What are the topics of interest?  
 Submitted papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development, and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Research papers will be reviewed to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, conceptual quality, innovation, and clarity of presentation.  
 OSS and OpenSym 2022 will follow their traditions and will cover and welcome topics that are appealing to the advances in their areas of interest. Although we will have a focus on “Openness in Emergency Situations”, all traditional topics will be covered and welcome. For each of the events, a non-comprehensive list of topics of interest is presented below:

  What is the submission process and format?  
 This year we will have a different, more inclusive, submission flow. We will offer the authors the opportunity to receive feedback based on extended abstracts. When submitting the extended abstract, please inform after the title of the paper (in the manuscript) if this refers to a potential full research paper, a new ideas paper, or (in the case of OSS only) a tool paper.  
 The papers accepted as extended abstracts will be invited to submit a full version of their paper which will be further reviewed. However, the authors who do not want to submit their full or new ideas paper (or have them rejected) will have the papers considered as part of the program as well.  
 We summarize this new process in the figure below:  
   For the extended abstracts, the following structure is recommended:  
 Motivation | : including the problem tackled in the paper, justification of the importance of the problem, positioning among the main related work/previous research; 
  Aim | : Highlight the research objectives, hypotheses, and/or research questions 
  Method | : details about the method followed to conduct the research 
  Results | : a summary of the results achieved in the study 
  Conclusion (impact) | : a brief discussion to conclude the paper, focusing on presenting how your findings move the state-of-the-art, showing the contribution of the paper/ highlighting the implications. 
  The extended abstracts maximum length is of 1,000 words  . References do not count in the 1000 words limit, but the number of references is limited to 10. You may also have at most 2 graphic elements (table/figure). It is important to use the format of the conference you are submitting your extended abstract, as follows:  
 OpenSym | : must be in English and conform to the ACM submission template (conference, in the new single-column format). 
  OSS Conference | : must be in English and conform to Springer’s guidelines for Computer Science proceedings. 
  All submissions must present original work, unpublished, and not under submission elsewhere. The authors must clearly explain the contribution of the work in terms of its theoretical and/or practical value and situate it in relation to previous work. The review process for both events is double-blind  , so manuscripts must be anonymized.  
 Papers should be submitted as PDF files at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=opensymandoss2022  , choosing which track you are submitting: OSS or OpenSym. All accepted submissions will be included in their respective conference proceedings—OSS is published by Springer and we are looking for a place to publish OpenSym’s proceedings. The open-access preprints of all accepted submissions will be collected and referenced from the conference website.  
 Authors whose submitted papers have been accepted for presentation at the conference have a choice of  
 having their paper become partof the official conference proceedings. 
  having no publication record at all but only the presentation at the conference. 
  OpenSym  
 This is only required after acceptance of your Extended Abstract. Please look at the previous section.   
 Submissions to OpenSym  must be in English and conform to the ACM submission template  (conference, in the new single-column format). All the submissions will be reviewed in a double-blinded process.  
 Research papers | : Submissions describing original research in the area of Open Collaboration. Research papers that discuss actionable insights resulting from the presented results will be particularly welcome. Research papers are expected to describe new methodologies and/or provide novel research results and should be evaluated scientifically. 
  New Ideas and Emerging Research | may contain innovative research and current work in progress. New ideas should present new directions well supported with a solid research plan, which can provide benefit for the community. Emerging Research papers should present initial and preliminary results with a non-complete evaluation in order to collect early feedback from the community. 
  We will also have an | Industry Track | . More details to come soon. 
  Submissions must not exceed the page limit (15 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for research papers; 8 pages plus 1 additional page of references for New Ideas and Emerging Research papers). The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).  
 Furthermore, we plan to have a Journal Article Collection, to which the best research papers in the conference will be invited to submit an extended version.  
 OSS  
 This is only required after acceptance of your Extended Abstract. Please look at the previous section.   
 Submissions to the OSS Conference  must be in English and conform to Springer’s guidelines for Computer Science proceedings  . All the submissions will be reviewed in a double-blinded process.  
 OSS conference will accept three kinds of submissions:  
 Research papers | : Submissions describing original research in the area of FLOSS systems. Research papers that discuss actionable insights resulting from the presented results will be particularly welcome. Research papers are expected to describe new methodologies and/or provide novel research results and will be evaluated scientifically. 
  New Ideas and Emerging Research | : New Ideas papers may contain innovative research and current work in progress. New ideas should present new directions well supported with a solid research plan, which can provide benefit for the community. Emerging Research papers should present initial and preliminary results with a non-complete evaluation in order to collect early feedback from the community. 
  Tool papers | : Submissions describing the novel release or original development of software applications, libraries, frameworks, or other FLOSS tools that have a significant user base or have been used to achieve significant practical results. Tool papers are expected to include a validation section showing the usefulness of the presented tools.

 Overview  
 The 19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation seeks to present innovative, exciting research in computer systems. OSDI brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software. OSDI emphasizes innovative research and quantified or insightful experiences in systems design and implementation.  
 OSDI takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice including operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data, embedded systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interface to related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, and databases. We encourage contributions with highly original ideas, new approaches, and groundbreaking results.  
 Submitting a Paper  
 Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the program committee.  
 A good paper will:  
 Motivate a significant problem 
  Propose an interesting and compelling solution 
  Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution 
  Draw appropriate conclusions 
  Clearly describe the paper's contributions 
  Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work 
  Submission Scope and Relevance:  The OSDI steering committee, in maintaining a three-decade tradition of a single-track program, is committed to deepening discussions on key computer systems topics. Starting from OSDI '25, there will be a deliberate focus on selecting papers that offer significant contributions to computer systems research and align with community interests.  Reviewers will evaluate submissions based on the topic relevance to computer systems and their potential to impact future research and practices in computer systems. Additionally, submissions must demonstrate relevance and offer unique insights to capture the interest of a substantial portion of OSDI attendees. By adhering to these criteria, OSDI aims to continue its legacy by focusing on innovative research that addresses pressing needs in the computer systems field.  
 Accepted papers will generally be available online to registered attendees before the conference. If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify production@usenix.org  . The papers will be available online to everyone beginning on the first day of the symposium.  
 Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the OSDI '25 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.  
 Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may, on the recommendation of a program chair, take action against authors who have committed them. See the USENIX Conference Submissions Policy  for details.  
 Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted as long as the authors have substantially addressed the previous reviewers' comments. If the prior conference's rejection notification has been received less than thirteen months before the OSDI '25 submission deadline, then the authors are requested to provide information regarding the previous submission and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This information should be uploaded via the submission form, and will not be shared with the OSDI '25 reviewers.  
 Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in OSDI. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. The co-chairs may then share that paper with the workshop's organizers and discuss it with them.  
 Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org  , technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is permitted. However, your OSDI submission must use an anonymized name for your project or system that differs from any used in such contexts.  
 USENIX discourages program co-chairs from submitting papers to the conferences they organize, although they are allowed to do so. Should either program co-chair submit work to OSDI '25, their papers will be handled exclusively by the other program co-chair and reviewed according to the same rigorous and double-blinded procedures that the program committee applies to all papers. In the event that a paper is co-authored by, or otherwise conflicted with both co-chairs, the co-chairs will designate a PC member to manage the reviewing process for that paper.  
 Questions? Contact your program co-chairs, osdi25chairs@usenix.org  , or the USENIX office, submissionspolicy@usenix.org  .  
 By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org  . For very special support circumstances (such as travel restrictions or health issues), USENIX may provide the possibility of remote presentation and Q&A.  
 If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact conference@usenix.org  as soon as possible. Visa applications are reportedly taking more than two months to process. Please identify yourself as a presenter or an author, and include your mailing address in your email request.  
 Deadline and Submission Instructions  
 Authors must register abstracts and submit full papers by the dates indicated above. These are hard deadlines, and no extensions will be given. Submitted papers must be no longer than 12 single-spaced 8.5" x 11" pages, including figures and tables, plus as many pages as needed for references, using 10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, two-column format, Times Roman or a similar font, within a text block 7" wide x 9" deep. Accepted papers will be allowed 14 pages in the proceedings, plus references. Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible in black and white, without requiring magnification. Papers so short as to be considered "extended abstracts" will not receive full consideration.  
 Supplementary Material  
 Authors may upload supplementary material in files separate from their submissions. PC members are not required to read supplementary material when reviewing the paper, so each paper should stand alone without it. Authors may use this for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Examples of materials that may be included are: formal proofs that are only sketched in the paper; snippets of code that detail an algorithm presented in the paper; and methodological details that are not essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. Importantly, because the PC members are NOT required to read the supplementary material, the submission must stand alone without it. Attaching supplementary material is optional; if your paper says that you have formal proofs or source code, you need not attach them to convince the PC of their existence.  
 Identity Blinding  
 The paper review process is double-blind. Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves or their institutions either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will be rejected without review. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, contact the program co-chairs, osdi25chairs@usenix.org  , well in advance of the submission deadline.  
 Abstract Registration  
 Registering abstracts a week before paper submission is an essential part of the paper-reviewing process, as PC members use this time to identify which papers they are qualified to review. Abstract registrations that do not provide sufficient information to understand the topic and contribution (e.g., empty abstracts, placeholder abstracts, or trivial abstracts) will be rejected, thereby precluding paper submission.  
 Conflicts  
 When registering your abstract, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members. A PC member is a conflict if and only if one or more of the following circumstances applies:  
 Institution:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (not counting concluded internships), or are going to begin employment at the same institution during the review period.  
 Advisor:  You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee.  
 Collaboration:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, program co-chairship, or editorship within the past two years (December 2022 through December 2024).  
 Personal:  You are close family relatives (spouses, domestic partners, parents, or children).  
 You must not identify a PC member as a conflict if none of these circumstances applies. For instance, the following are not sufficient grounds to specify a conflict with a PC member: they have reviewed the work before, they are employed by your competitor, they are your friend, they were your post-doc advisor or advisee, or they had the same advisor as you.  
 The chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding or removing conflicts if necessary. The chairs may reject abstracts or papers on the basis of missing or extraneous conflicts. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs.  
 Authors are also encouraged to contact the program co-chairs, osdi25chairs@usenix.org  , if needed to relate their OSDI submissions to relevant submissions of their own that are simultaneously under review or awaiting publication at other venues. The program co-chairs will use this information at their discretion to preserve the anonymity of the review process without jeopardizing the outcome of the current OSDI submission.  
 Papers must be in PDF format and must be submitted via the submission system  . For more details on the submission process, and for templates to use with LaTeX, Word, etc., authors should consult the detailed submission requirements  .  
 SUBMIT YOUR WORK    
 Author Response Period  
 OSDI will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting, during the dates shown above. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow.  
 Submission of a response is optional. The response can be of any length up to 2000 words. A shorter and crisper response is often advantageous, while a response longer than 2000 words is prohibited.  
 Revise and Resubmit  
 OSDI '25 will continue the option to revise and resubmit for some of the rejected papers. If a paper is given this option as indicated in the notification, authors will be provided with a list of issues to address. Authors may then resubmit a revised version with a response to the issues. If accepted, the paper will be presented at OSDI '25.

  Call for Papers  
   
 OPODIS is an open forum for the exchange of state-of-the-art knowledge on distributed computing and distributed computer systems. OPODIS aims at having a balanced program that combines theory and practice of distributed systems. OPODIS solicits papers in all aspects of distributed systems, including theory, specification, design, system building, and performance.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
   
 Distributed computing theory: Impossibility results in distributed computing, Game theory 
  Distributed ledger practice and theory: Blockchains, DAG consensus 
  Cloud and data centers, cloud and edge continuum 
  Communication and mobile networks

 Double-blind review  
 We will use double-blind peer review. All submissions must be anonymous. The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. We will use a somewhat relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review: you are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and please do not include obvious references that reveal your identity. A reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read it without accidentally learning the identity of the authors. Moreover, reviewers are not supposed to actively look for the identity of authors, for instance by searching the internet for the paper title. Please feel free to ask the PC Chairs ( opodis2024.pcchairs@gmail.com  ) if you have any questions about the double-blind policy of OPODIS 2024.  
 Submissions  
 Papers are to be submitted electronically through HotCRP (https://crp.info.ucl.ac.be/opodis2024/)  .  
 Submissions must be in English, in pdf format. 
  Submissions must be prepared using the | LaTeX style templates for LIPIcs | , choosing the A4 paper option. 
  Length: a submission must not exceed 15 pages, including everything but the references. Unlimited pages are allowed for references. 
  Paper information: the following information must appear in the first page of the submission: 
  The title of the paper, 
  A list of keywords, 
  An abstract summarizing the contributions of the submission, 
  Whether or not the paper is eligible for the best student paper award. 
  The first page is not a cover page and can include the start of the paper's main text. 
  Appendix: the submission may contain a clearly-marked appendix, which will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. Appendix publication is not guaranteed, and will be decided by the Program Committee. 
    
 The submission must contain a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. All of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the submission, including experimental results, should be included in the submission. A submission must report on original research that has not previously appeared in a journal or conference with published proceedings. It should not be concurrently submitted to such a journal or conference. Any overlap with a published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated. The Program Chairs reserve the right to reject submissions that are out of scope, of clearly inferior quality, or that violate the submission guidelines. Each of the remaining papers will undergo a thorough reviewing process.  
 Publication  
 OPODIS has post-proceedings published by Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) in gold open access mode. The proceedings become available online, free of charge, after the conference. Preliminary versions of the proceedings will be available to participants at the conference electronically. The camera-ready version of a paper must have the same format and be of the same length as its submitted version.  
 Awards  
 Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper (i.e., primarily written by a student). Eligibility for the best student paper award should be clearly indicated on the first page.  
 Registration and presentation  
 For every accepted paper at least one author is expected to register (as a regular registration) for the conference and present the work on-site in Lucca.

  In 2022, the 18th International Conference on Open Source Systems (OSS) and the 18th International Symposium on Open Collaboration (OpenSym) are joining forces and will be held as co-located events.  
 The goal of bringing these two communities together is to make it a holistic forum encompassing all topics related to open collaboration research and practice, including open source, open data, open science, open education, wikis, and related social media, Wikipedia, and IT-driven open innovation research.  
 Open collaboration emerged as one of the most important phenomena in the last decades. More recently, we saw how this global openness helped to respond to an international crisis, the Covid-19 crisis. Researchers from all over the world gathered efforts to find how to manage the pandemic. Synergies have been created, data opened and shared, knowledge disseminated, in order to accelerate research on vaccines and understand the virus behavior.  
 Following this historical situation, we decided to put this edition under the theme:  
 “Openness in Emergency Situations”  
 Open science is at the heart of this theme, including open data and open source tools that enabled this large-scale collaboration. We are interested in understanding cases and research that explore questions like: How “open” can benefit the society in emergency situations? What are the risks assigned to it? What are the processes, tools, and methods implemented to support openness?  
 More broadly, this year more than ever, our conference is about collaborations between people from computer science, information science, management, social science, humanities, and everyone interested in open collaboration and how it is helping and changing the world.  
 How will the CFP and Proceedings work?  
 While we will have a shared program, a single theme, and the same deadlines, we will keep two separate proceedings  . The goal is to keep the specifics of each of the communities in terms of archive and history. Therefore, formatting details and topics of interest are individual to each conference/symposium.  
 The intersection point between these two communities is the topics related to Open Source Software. Therefore, we encourage the authors of papers that touch this specific topic to submit to the OSS Conference.  
 What are the topics of interest?  
 Submitted papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development, and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Research papers will be reviewed to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, conceptual quality, innovation, and clarity of presentation.  
 OSS and OpenSym 2022 will follow their traditions and will cover and welcome topics that are appealing to the advances in their areas of interest. Although we will have a focus on “Openness in Emergency Situations”, all traditional topics will be covered and welcome. For each of the events, a non-comprehensive list of topics of interest is presented below:

  What is the submission process and format?  
 This year we will have a different, more inclusive, submission flow. We will offer the authors the opportunity to receive feedback based on extended abstracts. When submitting the extended abstract, please inform after the title of the paper (in the manuscript) if this refers to a potential full research paper, a new ideas paper, or (in the case of OSS only) a tool paper.  
 The papers accepted as extended abstracts will be invited to submit a full version of their paper which will be further reviewed. However, the authors who do not want to submit their full or new ideas paper (or have them rejected) will have the papers considered as part of the program as well.  
 We summarize this new process in the figure below:  
   For the extended abstracts, the following structure is recommended:  
 Motivation | : including the problem tackled in the paper, justification of the importance of the problem, positioning among the main related work/previous research; 
  Aim | : Highlight the research objectives, hypotheses, and/or research questions 
  Method | : details about the method followed to conduct the research 
  Results | : a summary of the results achieved in the study 
  Conclusion (impact) | : a brief discussion to conclude the paper, focusing on presenting how your findings move the state-of-the-art, showing the contribution of the paper/ highlighting the implications. 
  The extended abstracts maximum length is of 1,000 words  . References do not count in the 1000 words limit, but the number of references is limited to 10. You may also have at most 2 graphic elements (table/figure). It is important to use the format of the conference you are submitting your extended abstract, as follows:  
 OpenSym | : must be in English and conform to the ACM submission template (conference, in the new single-column format). 
  OSS Conference | : must be in English and conform to Springer’s guidelines for Computer Science proceedings. 
  All submissions must present original work, unpublished, and not under submission elsewhere. The authors must clearly explain the contribution of the work in terms of its theoretical and/or practical value and situate it in relation to previous work. The review process for both events is double-blind  , so manuscripts must be anonymized.  
 Papers should be submitted as PDF files at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=opensymandoss2022  , choosing which track you are submitting: OSS or OpenSym. All accepted submissions will be included in their respective conference proceedings—OSS is published by Springer and we are looking for a place to publish OpenSym’s proceedings. The open-access preprints of all accepted submissions will be collected and referenced from the conference website.  
 Authors whose submitted papers have been accepted for presentation at the conference have a choice of  
 having their paper become partof the official conference proceedings. 
  having no publication record at all but only the presentation at the conference. 
  OpenSym  
 This is only required after acceptance of your Extended Abstract. Please look at the previous section.   
 Submissions to OpenSym  must be in English and conform to the ACM submission template  (conference, in the new single-column format). All the submissions will be reviewed in a double-blinded process.  
 Research papers | : Submissions describing original research in the area of Open Collaboration. Research papers that discuss actionable insights resulting from the presented results will be particularly welcome. Research papers are expected to describe new methodologies and/or provide novel research results and should be evaluated scientifically. 
  New Ideas and Emerging Research | may contain innovative research and current work in progress. New ideas should present new directions well supported with a solid research plan, which can provide benefit for the community. Emerging Research papers should present initial and preliminary results with a non-complete evaluation in order to collect early feedback from the community. 
  We will also have an | Industry Track | . More details to come soon. 
  Submissions must not exceed the page limit (15 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for research papers; 8 pages plus 1 additional page of references for New Ideas and Emerging Research papers). The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).  
 Furthermore, we plan to have a Journal Article Collection, to which the best research papers in the conference will be invited to submit an extended version.  
 OSS  
 This is only required after acceptance of your Extended Abstract. Please look at the previous section.   
 Submissions to the OSS Conference  must be in English and conform to Springer’s guidelines for Computer Science proceedings  . All the submissions will be reviewed in a double-blinded process.  
 OSS conference will accept three kinds of submissions:  
 Research papers | : Submissions describing original research in the area of FLOSS systems. Research papers that discuss actionable insights resulting from the presented results will be particularly welcome. Research papers are expected to describe new methodologies and/or provide novel research results and will be evaluated scientifically. 
  New Ideas and Emerging Research | : New Ideas papers may contain innovative research and current work in progress. New ideas should present new directions well supported with a solid research plan, which can provide benefit for the community. Emerging Research papers should present initial and preliminary results with a non-complete evaluation in order to collect early feedback from the community. 
  Tool papers | : Submissions describing the novel release or original development of software applications, libraries, frameworks, or other FLOSS tools that have a significant user base or have been used to achieve significant practical results. Tool papers are expected to include a validation section showing the usefulness of the presented tools. 
  We will also have an | Industry Track | . More details to come soon. 
  Submissions must not exceed the page limit (15 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for research papers; 8 pages plus 1 additional page of references for New Ideas and Emerging Research papers). The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).

 Call for Participation: Peace!

 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”   
  Albert Einstein   
 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”   
  John Lennon   

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 The 19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation seeks to present innovative, exciting research in computer systems. OSDI brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software. OSDI emphasizes innovative research and quantified or insightful experiences in systems design and implementation. OSDI takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data, embedded systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interface to related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, and databases. We encourage contributions with highly original ideas, new approaches, and groundbreaking results.  最終更新 Dou Sun  2024-08-18

28. Conference OZCHI_0:
30th November to 4th December 2024  
  Meanjin | Brisbane, Australia   

 Welcome to OzCHI 2024  
 Thank you for joining us—see you next year in Sydney!  
 Latest:  The proceedings folder link  has been added to the navigation menu.   
 OzCHI 2024 is the 36th Australian Conference on Human-Computer Interaction. This annual non-profit event is for the Computer-Human Interaction Special Interest Group (CHISIG) and serves as a premier forum for the latest advancements in HCI research and practice. This year's event will be hosted in Brisbane, Australia, from 30 November to 4 December 2024.  
 OzCHI is Australasia's leading forum for cutting-edge HCI research and practice. It attracts a diverse international community of researchers, industry practitioners, academics, and students. Participants come from over 25 countries and various fields, including interaction design, user experience, information architecture, software engineering, human factors, information systems analysis, and social sciences. We welcome and encourage international and industry submissions and participation.  
 Theme  Beyond Being Human  
 This year’s conference theme Beyond Being Human reflects the continuing debate about how HCI extends beyond designing with and for humans, to include non-human agents from the natural and artificial realms.  
 Venue  The University of Queensland, St Lucia Campus  
 The venue for OzCHI 2024 is the University of Queensland’s main campus in St Lucia. The entire conference will take place in the Advanced Engineering Building  , which borders the recently renovated UQ Lakes  precinct, with the single paper presentation track taking place in the GHD Auditorium  . Brisbane’s integrated public transit system will offer conference participants multiple options for arriving on campus from city centre venues and accommodation, with the CityCat  river ferries a popular choice.

  Learning Analytics for Transition, Disruption and Social Change  

 Society for Learning Analytics Research  
 The Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) is an interdisciplinary network of leading international researchers who are exploring the role and impact of analytics on teaching, learning, training and development.  

 About the University of California  
 The University of California, Irvine is a driving force of innovation and discovery in educational technology and learning analytics. UCI is ranked in the top 10 of public institutions in the United States (currently number 7). Further, as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), hosting LAK with UCI will afford broader access to students and faculty that are currently under-represented within the LAK community. Such opportunities to ensure diversity in the LAK conference will benefit the Society for many years to come.

 LAK22 Moves Online  
 We had sincerely hoped to be able to host a face to face event in 2022 but given the ongoing realities of the global pandemic due to the Delta COVID-19 variant there continues to be substantial uncertainty of international travel restrictions and vaccination rates/status for many countries. While for some countries restrictions have been able to be relaxed, for others restrictions are being reintroduced therefore as a diverse and global community we need to take into account the situations of all members when planning an international event that involves many months of preparation. Thank you to all the participants who responded to the survey and have raised their issues and concerns with us. Thus the Society for Learning Analytics Research and LAK22 organizers have made the difficult decision to host LAK22 fully online.  We would like to acknowledge and thank the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Spa for working with us during these challenging times and we hope to host a face to face LAK there sometime in the future. Please visit the News page to read our full announcement  .  

   Why You Should Join Us at LAK and Beyond!  
 The Society for Learning Analytics Research is celebrating 12 years of LAK conferences in 2022! The field continues to grow year over year. LAK21 was our largest conference of almost 600 attendees from around the world. Take a peek at why we think you should submit to LAK conferences, attend LAK or LASI, join our mailing list and better yet become a SoLAR Member! At SoLAR, our overall mission continues to be to grow the field of learning analytics globally. Join us in this mission today and we hope to see you at an event soon!

 22nd International Conference on Practical applications of Agents and Multi-Agent System  
 Salamanca (Spain) - Hybrid  
 11th-13th July, 2024  
   
 www.paams.net   

 Research on Agents  and Multi-Agent Systems  has matured during the last decade and many effective applications of this technology are now deployed. PAAMS  provides an international forum to present and discuss the latest scientific developments and their effective applications, to assess the impact of the approach, and to facilitate technology transfer. PAAMS started as a local initiative, but has since grown to become the international yearly platform to present, to discuss, and to disseminate the latest developments and the most important outcomes related to real-world applications. Right now, PAAMS is classified as B2 by CAPES Qualis CC-Events  and B by CORE Ranking  . It provides a unique opportunity to bring multi-disciplinary experts, academics and practitioners together to exchange their experience in the development and deployment of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. PAAMS intends to bring together researchers and developers from industry and the academic world to report on the latest scientific and technical advances on the application of multi-agent systems, to discuss and debate the major issues, and to showcase the latest systems using agent based technology. It will promote a forum for discussion on how agent-based techniques, methods, and tools help system designers to accomplish the mapping between available agent technology and application needs. Other stakeholders should be rewarded with a better understanding of the potential and challenges of the agent-oriented approach.

 22nd International Conference on Practical applications of Agents and Multi-Agent System (PAAMS'24)  
  Scope   
   
 Research on Agents  and Multi-Agent Systems  has matured during the last decade and many effective applications of this technology are now deployed. PAAMS  provides an international forum to present and discuss the latest scientific developments and their effective applications, to assess the impact of the approach, and to facilitate technology transfer. PAAMS started as a local initiative, but has since grown to become the international yearly platform to present, to discuss, and to disseminate the latest developments and the most important outcomes related to real-world applications. Right now, PAAMS is classified as B2 by CAPES Qualis CC-Events  and B by CORE Ranking  . It provides a unique opportunity to bring multi-disciplinary experts, academics and practitioners together to exchange their experience in the development and deployment of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. PAAMS intends to bring together researchers and developers from industry and the academic world to report on the latest scientific and technical advances on the application of multi-agent systems, to discuss and debate the major issues, and to showcase the latest systems using agent based technology. It will promote a forum for discussion on how agent-based techniques, methods, and tools help system designers to accomplish the mapping between available agent technology and application needs. Other stakeholders should be rewarded with a better understanding of the potential and challenges of the agent-oriented approach.

 ACM Case Studies   
 Written by leading domain experts for software engineers, ACM Case Studies provide an in-depth look at how software teams overcome specific challenges by implementing new technologies, adopting new practices, or a combination of both. Often through first-hand accounts, these pieces explore what the challenges were, the tools and techniques that were used to combat them, and the solution that was achieved.

  SCOPE  
  ________________________________________________________________________________________  
  The success of Bioinformatics in recent years has been prompted by research in Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine in several initiatives. These initiatives gave rise to an exponential increase in the volume and diversification of data, including nucleotide and protein sequences and annotations, high-throughput experimental data, biomedical literature, among many others.  
  Systems Biology is a related research area that has been replacing the reductionist view that dominated Biology research in the last decades, requiring the coordinated efforts of biological researchers with those related to data analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulation and optimization.  
  The accumulation and exploitation of large-scale data bases prompts for new computational technology and for research into these issues. In this context, many widely successful computational models and tools used by biologists in these initiatives, such as clustering and classification methods for gene expression data, are based on Computer Science/ Artificial Intelligence (CS/AI) techniques. In fact, these methods have been helping in tasks related to knowledge discovery, modeling and optimization tasks, aiming at the development of computational models so that the response of biological complex systems to any perturbation can be predicted.  
  The 16th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics (PACBB) aims to promote the interaction among the scientific community to discuss applications of CS/AI with an interdisciplinary character, exploring the interactions between sub-areas of CS/AI, Bioinformatics, Chemoinformatics and Systems Biology.  
  Brand new ideas in these fields are sought, as well as substantial and relevant revisions and actualizations of previously presented work, project summaries and PhD thesis presented or not.

 Distributed Optimization of Charging Station Selection of Electric Vehicles  
  In this paper we focus on the aspect of the expected functionality of multi-agent systems. We argue that intention-awareness is a technique to improve the trustworthiness of the expected functionality of multi-agent systems. The coordination of the charging station selections of electric vehicles is a large-scale and open multi-agent application. Aggregated intention-aware technology is good choice for the coordination of systems with a lot of agents, because the influence of a single agent on the aggregation is small, and the temptation to submit deceptive intention diminishes. Centralized intention aggregation may become a weak point. We propose a decentralized intention-aware approach using distributed constraint optimization algorithms to coordinate the charging station selection of electric vehicles. We show in a simulated scenario that the distributed intention-aware technique improves the quality of the solution provided by the multi-agent system, and thus improves the trustworthiness of the expected functionality of the system. We evaluate the solution with several distributed constraint optimization algorithms.

 A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Battery Management in Dairy Farming via Proximal Policy Optimization  
  Dairy farms consume a significant amount of electricity for their operations, and this research focuses on enhancing energy efficiency and minimizing the impact on the environment in the sector by maximizing the utilization of renewable energy sources. This research investigates the application of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL), to enhance dairy farming battery management. We evaluate the algorithm’s effectiveness based on its ability to reduce reliance on the electricity grid, highlighting the potential of DRL to enhance energy management in dairy farming. Using real-world data our results demonstrate how the PPO approach outperforms Q-learning by 1.62% for reducing electricity import from the grid. This significant improvement highlights the potential of the Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm for improving energy efficiency and sustainability in dairy farms.

 Reinforcement Learning Enabled Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading for Dairy Farms  
  Farm businesses are increasingly adopting renewables to enhance energy efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels and the grid. This shift aims to decrease dairy farms’ dependence on traditional electricity grids by enabling the sale of surplus renewable energy in Peer-to-Peer markets. However, the dynamic nature of farm communities poses challenges, requiring specialized algorithms for P2P energy trading. To address this, the Multi-Agent Peer-to-Peer Dairy Farm Energy Simulator (MAPDES) has been developed, providing a platform to experiment with Reinforcement Learning techniques. The simulations demonstrate significant cost savings, including a 43% reduction in electricity expenses, a 42% decrease in peak demand, and a 1.91% increase in energy sales compared to baseline scenarios lacking peer-to-peer energy trading or renewable energy sources.

 Benchmarking Large Language Models for Multi-agent Systems: A Comparative Analysis of AutoGen, CrewAI, and TaskWeaver  
  This paper presents the benchmarking of three multi-agent systems powered by large language models. The paper presents a comparative analysis of AutoGen, CrewAI, and TaskWeaver. Nowadays, large language models have emerged as powerful tools able to assist users in various areas. The integration of large language models into multi-agent systems increases their potential for collaborative problem-solving. This study focuses on a case study involving a machine learning code generation task which is used to evaluate the framework’s performance. To assess the performance of the solutions, it is requested to create energy forecasting models using the same dataset as the base. After producing the code, a new dataset is used to test the model performance using the root mean square error. The three solutions were able to provide results using multiple large language models. The best result was achieved by TaskWeaver using GPT-3.5, with an error of 25.04.

 Multi-agent Opinion Pooling by Voting for Bins: Simulations and Characterization  
  In the context of aggregating probabilistic opinions from multiple agents facing severe uncertainty, imprecise probabilities are commonly utilized to represent their beliefs. Voting for Bins (VfB) is a novel voting method enabling agents with imprecise probabilistic beliefs to vote for sets of probability intervals, or bins. Inspired by the Condorcet Jury Theorem, VfB allows for the derivation of probabilistic assurances regarding the likelihood of identifying the correct alternative among a set, assuming the independence of the electorate and given estimates of the agents’ average competence levels. VfB also facilitates direct computation of the maximal number of bins, thereby determining the precision permitted in the voting process. In this work, we compare VfB’s performance, assessed by assigning an epistemic value to each aggregate, against standard imprecise pooling methods through multi-agent voting simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first empirical comparison of imprecise pooling methods utilizing parameterized imprecise beliefs generated through a randomized process. Furthermore, we formally integrate VfB into the probabilistic pooling framework by examining which desirable properties, identified in the pooling literature, are satisfied by VfB.

 Neural Cellular Automaton for Decentralized Inference in Distributed Manipulation Systems  
  Distributed manipulation systems employ a grid of independently controlled actuators to achieve precise manipulation of objects resting on their surface. Despite the decentralized nature of the actuators, current implementations use centralized feedback mechanisms to provide information about the object’s position to the controllers. This centralized approach introduces a potential vulnerability, as a failure in the feedback system could result in the complete failure of the system. This paper proposes an approach for characterizing objects in decentralized systems. Its validation is demonstrated through the implementation of a two-dimensional simulated network of sensing agents. These agents work collaboratively to determine a global property - the geometrical center of an object - through local communication of the information at their disposal. The method uses a Neural Cellular Automaton, a multi-agent system in which the update rule of each agent is expressed as a Neural Network, and it is a function of its neighborhood’s information. Experiments show that trained on known objects, the system displayed outstanding precision in inferring their centers and demonstrated remarkable adaptability when encountering unknown objects.

 Synthetic Data Generation for Machine Learning Models with Cognitive Agent Simulations  
  The use of synthetic data for training machine learning models (ML) in social media domains can address issues such as data availability and bias, but poses challenges, including properly reflecting causal relationships and matching the consistency of real data. In this paper, we explore the benefits and limitations of using synthetic data generated by cognitive agent simulations. By simulating human interactions and social media dynamics, these models can capture constraints and nuances of real-world scenarios. We report initial experiments that show that ML algorithms trained on real data augmented with synthetic data outperform those trained solely on original data, achieving up to 25% improvement in KS distance and RMSE metrics. This approach is applied to two domain problems: predicting code quality based on open-source code discussions and detecting and countering bot attacks on social media platforms. For code quality prediction, we used discussions and patches from the Linux Kernel Mailing List to predict patch reversions. In the bot attack detection problem, synthetic Reddit data helps create realistic social network environments to study interactions between influencers and bots under different conditions. The paper presents empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of synthetic data in improving ML model performance and introduces an agent-based framework for generating realistic synthetic data for social media experiments. The findings suggest promising avenues for future research and highlight the potential of this approach.

 A Digital Twin Approach to Building’s Dossier for Seismic Prevention  
  During the last decade, Central Italy has been hardly hit by several earthquakes, creating many victims and causing heavy damage to buildings and houses. Restoration, financed by the central government, brought out the need for a reliable process for recording and tracking back the maintenance history of every building. This paper presents a novel solution for tracking and managing seismic interventions in buildings. The proposed system, called “Building Ledger Dossier”, defines the implementation of a Digital Twin of the building and leverages Blockchain Technology to create an immutable and transparent record of all interventions performed on the artefact. The structure is assumed to be modelled with the Open Sees framework, and all projects and interventions are registered as Non-Fungible Tokens on a Blockchain network to gain benefit from time-stamping and foster Accountability. A decentralised autonomous organisation manages identity access and work advancement approval systems.

 MineLlama: Llama with Retrieval-Augmented Generation as A Decision Maker in Minecraft  
  This paper introduces MineLlama, a lightweight framework that utilizes a localized large language model, Llama, to enhance decision-making in the sandbox game Minecraft, without relying on external APIs. MineLlama operates a two-layer framework, consisting of planning and executing modules. In the planning module, MineLlama employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paired with a query engine that utilizes recipe information from Minecraft to decompose a final goal into a series of interdependent subgoals. In the executing module, MineLlama is also constructed using a RAG, with a query engine informed by general knowledge of Minecraft, to guide the agent in choosing the appropriate actions. The framework’s efficiency is demonstrated through evaluations on 7 diverse Minecraft tasks, showcasing its ability to guide agents in achieving specific goals. We upload all the contents including code and videos to: https://minecraftagents.github.io/MineLlama_hp/ .

 Learning Automata Strategies for Prolonging Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks  
  This paper aims to solve the Maximum Lifetime Coverage Problem (MLCP) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) by incorporating a Learning Automaton. The proposed framework seeks to determine an optimized activity schedule that extends the network’s lifespan while ensuring that the monitoring of designated target areas meets predefined coverage requirements. The proposed algorithm harnesses the advantages of localized algorithms, including leveraging limited knowledge of neighboring nodes, fostering self-organization, and effectively prolonging the network’s longevity while maintaining the required coverage ratio in the target field.

 Options to Speed-Up Search in Lifelong Multi-Agent Pathfinding  
  A well-studied abstract model for navigating agents in a distributed environment without collisions is known as Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). MAPF has two interrelated aspects: one is to find the paths for the agents without collisions, and the other is to optimize the conflict resolutions between the paths. We focus on the first aspect, and we investigate three options: map reduction with waypoints, prioritized search and one-way restrictions. To our knowledge, our map reduction technique is a novelty in MAPF. We evaluate the three speed-up options on the scenarios of the League of Robot Runners competition. The results show that the improvement greatly depends on the size, style and layout of the maps. Prioritized search does not have big impact. The usage of one-way restriction rules is only worthwhile in specific maps. Map reduction on larger, complex maps drastically improves performance.

 Cooperative Task Execution in Multi-agent Systems  
  We propose a multi-agent system that enables groups of agents to collaborate and work autonomously to execute tasks. Groups can work in a decentralized manner and can adapt to dynamic changes in the environment. Groups of agents solve assigned tasks by exploring the solution space cooperatively based on the highest reward first. The tasks have a dependency structure associated with them. We rigorously evaluated the performance of the system and the individual group performance using centralized and decentralized control approaches for task distribution. Based on the results, the centralized approach is more efficient for systems with a less-dependent system $$G_{18}$$ G 18 (a well-known program graph that contains 18 nodes with few links), while the decentralized approach performs better for systems with a highly-dependent system $$G_{40}$$ G 40 (a program graph that contains 40 highly interlinked nodes). We also evaluated task allocation to groups that do not have interdependence. Our findings reveal that there was significantly less difference in the number of tasks allocated to each group in a less-dependent system than in a highly-dependent one. The experimental results showed that a large number of small-size cooperative groups of agents unequivocally improved the system’s performance compared to a small number of large-size cooperative groups of agents. Therefore, it is essential to identify the optimal group size for a system to enhance its performance.

 Federated Neural Machine Translation Using Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning  
  Neural machine translation has significantly improved translation accuracy, attracting various sectors of society. A highly accurate neural machine translation requires a large amount of high-quality bilingual corpus. Sharing bilingual data among different organizations is challenging due to copyright and confidentiality concerns. Federated learning resolves this by allowing multiple clients to collaboratively improve a translation model while maintaining the privacy of their individual datasets. However, the varied nature of the data each participant holds can diminish the model’s accuracy, and integrating all translation models does not ensure improved accuracy for all. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-agent system that uses deep reinforcement learning to integrate translation models during the federated learning process. The system dynamically selects partners for each aggregation phase, with agents developing strategies through deep reinforcement learning to identify the most suitable partners for collaboration. We have validated our method using Wikipedia data from three distinct domains, and it has demonstrated superiority over traditional methods. Additionally, we have confirmed that our method increases the translation accuracy for each client by 33.9% compared to the current federated learning approach.

 A Decentralized Agent-Based Model for Crisis Events Using Embedded Systems  
  Multi-agent systems (MAS) applied to Embedded Systems enable cognitive agents to act in the physical world. However, the application of these systems has been little explored to automate communication during crisis events. With this approach, it would be possible to help collect real-time data and deploy rescue forces in risky locations. This paper describes a decentralized, proactive, and agent-based communication model. To validate the proposal, we applied our approach to a physical prototype of smart city devices. In this scenario, we include the interaction of different MAS in a simulation’s flood scenario. The results show the architecture’s effectiveness in collecting real-time data, providing a reliable, low-cost way to integrate citizens and governments during crises. The architecture is a promising approach for crisis management applications that takes advantage of the autonomous behavior of agents in MAS, improving the obtaining of subsidies to feed systems in smart cities and assisting decision-making.

 Human and BDI-Agent Interaction via KQML Messages over IMAP and SMTP  
  Multi-agent Systems (MAS) are groups of autonomous agents that act in the same environment, competing or collaborating to achieve individual or collective goals. Such systems can be integrated into embedded devices to perform tasks that control hardware. The main challenges encountered between Embedded MAS are the connectionless protocols some IoT middleware use for agent communication and the lack of security in transferring messages over the network. Therefore, it is essential to use efficient, safe, and reliable means of communication. This work proposes a connection-oriented communication architecture using secure channels provided by network protocols in the application layer. This work contributes to the advancement of MAS by addressing the integration of email protocols and seeking the development of a customized agent architecture based on the Jason framework to enable secure and simplified human-agent interaction.

 Models of Intelligent Tutoring Systems Based on Autonomous Agents for Virtual Learning Environments: A Systematic Literature Review  
  Virtual education combines didactic strategies with information and communication technologies to facilitate student access, interaction, and active participation. Academic monitoring and tutoring should be conducted within virtual learning environments (VLE) with the support of a virtual tutor to provide personalized advice and feedback. The review integrates theories, didactic strategies, learning styles, and computational models. This research presents a systematic review of literature on tutoring models in virtual education. The objective is to identify intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) models that use autonomous agents and expert systems in virtual learning environments. Additionally, strategies for implementing ITS in VLEs are presented. The identified models focus on adaptive learning, learning styles, and student skills for developing a specific course. It is proposed to design an architecture in the Moodle platform for academic monitoring of students in the online modality using autonomous agents. A holistic approach is considered, combining the efficiency of AI with didactic strategies that personalize learning through friendly human-machine interaction. The research on ITS models focuses on adaptive learning, considering new technological trends, while also considering the interaction between the student and the virtual tutor.

 Dynamic Estimation of Customer Movements by Agent-Based Simulation with Particle Filter  
  Understanding customer purchasing behavior in shopping malls is essential for developing marketing strategies to boost overall sales. Traditional customer flow analyses, through measurements or simulations, have not sufficiently accounted for behavioral changes due to time or events, failing to capture the variations in customer behavior across different situations. This paper proposes a method that dynamically captures changes in customer behavior by sequentially incorporating measurement data into simulations. We employ a particle filter, a data assimilation technique, to agent-based simulation to dynamically estimate the customer’s transition tendencies between stores. The evaluation of the proposed method involves estimating the transition tendencies in a virtual shopping mall based on real-time inflow counts of customers. The experiments show that the proposed method can qualitatively estimate the dynamically changing customer’s transition tendencies. Implementing this approach could afford a dynamic insight into customer behavior, aiding in the formulation of effective strategies to drive sales and improve safety.

 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Powered by a Multi-agent System to Assisted the Operation of Industries  
  The introduction of large language models in recent years transformed the use of artificial intelligence in our daily life, making it available to common users and allowing them to interact with natural language processing machines. However, the common and general knowledge of large language models is not reliable when it comes to the quality of the response and its veracity. The proposed work integrates the use of retrieval-augmented generation with large language models with a multi-agent system framework to enable the creation of trees of knowledge where multiple agents have domain specific knowledge. The proposed agent-based solution was tested in a realistic case study where multiple knowledge domains are distributed amongst six different agents. The case study evaluates the capacity of agents to delegate questions according to its topics and the capacity of correctly replying to questions. The results are promising, demonstrating the ability of large language models to assess and process information that wasn’t used in its training process.

 EGAR: Environment Generator for Agent-Based Research  
  Agent-based modeling (ABM) allows the representation of real-world phenomena using agents, a virtual environment, and interactions between them. It has become one of the most important tools for studying complex phenomena in social sciences.The correct placement of agents, locations, structures, and objects in the virtual environment, e.g. a city, is important in the development of an ABM in order to increase the realism and accuracy of the simulations.Unity is a game engine that allows the development of ABM with the advantage of greatly optimizing the management of resources compared to other alternatives, making it possible to reduce simulation time or handle more complex models. In this work, a tool is proposed that allows the generation of a more precise virtual environment for the development of ABM in Unity.The tool developed facilitates the visualization and distribution of agents and the creation of networks between them. It provides a way to explore and understand the social and spatial processes taking place in the simulated environment.By combining ABM, GIS data, and visualization tools in virtual environments, researchers have a robust framework for tackling complex modeling problems. For example, in social sciences, this integrated approach allows the exploration of hypothetical scenarios, the evaluation of intervention strategies, and a better understanding of networks of influence. Two real-world problems, the spread of a virus and the implementation of a new urban plan based on superblocks, are presented to illustrate this tool.

 Collaborating Digital Twins for Health Coaching  
  Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are digital characters that behave like humans and utter humanlike dialogues. They are digital twins of a human coach and are cost effective and reachable as compared to human coaches who typically are costly and have long wait times for appointment. To support a healthy life-style, multiple health experts may be needed and our multi-agent digital twins give access to all the coaches in the same session. To provide motivation and encourage following the advice given, these coaches use relational cues in their dialogues including empowerment, working alliance and affirmation cues which are found in actual human-human coaching sessions. Our digital twins simulate three coaches who are experts in diet, physical activity and cognitive health which collaborate with each other, and the human, to provide a holistic coaching experience. This paper reports on our use of Generative AI to modify neutral dialogues with these relational cues. We recommend that both automated and human validation be undertaken in the context of health advice.

 Overcoming Computational Complexity: A Scalable Agent-Based Model of Traffic Activity Using FLAME-GPU  
  Agent-based modelling (ABM) has significantly advanced the simulation of complex systems across various disciplines, including economic markets, traffic systems, and ecological research. By representing individuals as autonomous agents operating within a defined environment, ABMs facilitate the exploration of system behaviours and the testing of interventions in a controlled setting. However, the computational demands of ABMs, particularly in simulating large-scale systems, pose significant challenges. This article addresses these challenges by introducing a GPU-accelerated transport model for the Isle of Wight, leveraging the FLAME-GPU framework to enhance scalability and efficiency in traffic simulation. By comparing the proposed model with traditional, non-GPU accelerated simulations, such as SUMO, the study demonstrates improved performance metrics, including simulation speed and the ability to handle larger vehicle populations effectively. This contribution not only showcases the potential of GPU acceleration in overcoming computational constraints of ABMs but also provides a practical framework for simulating transport systems at a more granular and extensive scale than previously possible. Through detailed experimentation, the article illustrates the model’s capability to realistically simulate the vehicle population of the Isle of Wight, aiming for a balance between computational tractability and the accurate representation of complex traffic interactions.

 Measuring Fairness in AI Explanations with LEADR: Local Explanation Amplification Disparity Ratio  
  We investigate the fairness of local explanations in AI models by comparing the mean explanations for privileged and unprivileged groups across various datasets and model types. Specifically, we train linear, multi-layer perceptron, and explainable boosting machine (EBM) models, on several key academic datasets. Local explanations are generated using both post-hoc methods (LIME), and direct methods - logistic regression, integrated gradients and EBM local feature importance. By comparing these explanations across models and methods, we introduce a new metric, the Local Explanation Amplification Disparity Ratio (LEADR), to measure disparities in feature attribution between privileged and unprivileged groups. Our preliminary findings suggest that transparent Whitebox models may exhibit a tendency to display greater disparity in bias than opaque Blackbox models. This insight encourages further research into bias mitigation strategies that are tailored to different algorithm types, with the goal of minimizing undesired bias in AI systems.

 Adaptive Learning of Centralized and Decentralized Rewards in Multi-agent Imitation Learning  
  Imitation learning aims at teaching agents to perform desired behaviors by observing expert demonstrations. This approach can be generalized to multi-agent environments, where it is possible to achieve a mutually beneficial policies equilibrium through the use of specialized rewards. One such reward structure can be implemented by using centralized rewards for cooperative agents and decentralized rewards for non-cooperative agents. However, in mixed multi-agent environments, that contain both cooperative and competitive agents, it is necessary to develop a more nuanced approach to reward allocation. In these situations, one part of the reward can be shared among all cooperative agents while another part targets each agent individually. To address this challenge, our work proposes a novel two-component reward model for each agent: a centralized shared component and a decentralized agent-specific component. We conducted several experiments using three different environments to evaluate the performance of our proposed model compared to its individual components. Our results showed that the combined model outperform all of its constituent models in mixed environments, effectively imitating the centralized reward for cooperative environments but exhibiting no improvement in competitive environments. Finally, we tested the transparency of our model by providing representative examples and examining the scalar weights assigned to the centralized and decentralized components within the combined model (code available at: https://github.com/engyasin/Adaptive_learning_4_MAIL ).

 Integrating Supervised and Reinforcement Learning for Heterogeneous Traffic Simulation  
  Traffic simulation is needed for planning safe routes of self-driving cars and in analyzing traffic situations of a given area. Commonly supervised learning methods of vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic models have several limitations such as drifting errors and weak generalization to novel scenarios. Reinforcement learning can address these issues but it is much slower to converge due to the large state and action spaces involved in real-world traffic.To overcome this challenge, a hybrid methodology that combines supervised learning for short-term agents kinematics and reinforcement learning for long-term trajectory planning is developed in this work, and then tested on two distinct heterogeneous traffic datasets: 1) InD dataset of intersections traffic and 2) UniD dataset of shared space traffic. The results showcase the effectiveness of this method as it outperforms the supervised learning baseline models in terms of lower average displacement errors, increased success rate, and higher survival time for simulated agents. Additionally, the generalization of this approach was demonstrated by testing it on both regular intersection traffic and shared space traffic.This approach combines the benefits of supervised learning’s ability to learn complicated systems like vehicle kinematics and reinforcement learning’s potential for long-term planning in real-world traffic situations (code and video demonstrations: https://github.com/engyasin/SLRL ).

 Dynamic Modification of Agent Behaviors Without Disrupting a Running System  
  One of the important research areas is a modification of agent behaviors within a running system. Although this topic has been addressed in the past, the typical focus was on agent reasoning, where adaptability was concerned mostly with selecting appropriate pre-defined agent behaviors. While this approach allows agents to respond to environmental changes, it does not adequately address issues with (1) a dynamic introduction of previously unknown behaviors, and (2) execution of modifications without disrupting the remaining processes. Therefore, these two aspects become the core of the following contribution. The work shows how agent behaviors can be represented and modified using Rule-based Expert Systems with Expression Languages, where the adaptations are possible without interrupting agent system operation. The implemented solution is demonstrated using an example of a simple multi-agent restaurant recommendation system.

 A Machine Learning-Based Trading Strategy Integrating Technical Analysis and Multi-agent Simulation  
  This paper introduces TradeStrat-ML, a novel framework for stock market trading. It integrates various techniques: technical analysis, hybrid machine learning models, multi-agent-based simulations (MABS), and financial modeling for stock market analysis and future predictions. The process involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features from preprocessed financial data. The output of this model is then combined with three machine learning models (Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)) to predict future stock price indices. Subsequently, the models are evaluated, compared, and the most accurate model is selected for stock market prediction. In the final stage, the selected model, along with the Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator, is used to develop an optimized trading strategy. The TradeStrat-ML system is organized into four main layers and validated using MABS simulations. Comparative analysis and simulation experiments collectively indicate that this new combination prediction model is a potent and practical tool for informed investment decision-making.

 AAMA-Sim – A Gazebo and ROS2-Based Simulation Tool for Agent-Based Modelling of Cyber-Physical Systems  
  The development of complex Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) represents a formidable challenge. Within this process, researchers and developers are tasked with designing, testing, and validating many agent behaviours applicable across various facets of the application. Yet, the implementation phase of these agents presents significant difficulties, notably due to the challenges and high costs associated with testing behaviours in physical systems. Although numerous simulation tools exist designed to offer a virtual testing environment for engineers to validate their designs, a prevalent observation is that most of these tools primarily focus on the semantics of the modelled environment, often neglecting the intricacies of real-world physical conditions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new simulation testbench where engineers can adjust the simulation parameters to meet specific needs, thereby reducing the disparity between simulated environments and real-world constraints. This paper elucidates how a multi-agent system can leverage this advanced simulation environment to evaluate its agents’ behaviours within a context that closely mimics real-world conditions. Moreover, we explore the capabilities of the simulation environment’s sandbox features, which allow engineers to customize the environment in alignment with their unique use cases, thereby enhancing the utility and applicability of the simulation for comprehensive behavioural testing and validation.

 A Pet Robot Prototype for Animal-Assisted Therapy  
  Social robots are gaining importance in helping society in healthcare and education. The use of pet robots in healthcare has emerged as a field of great interest to provide companionship and entertainment to vulnerable people, such as older adults. Numerous studies have recently demonstrated the positive effects of animal therapy in cognitive and physical rehabilitation, helping to alleviate the adverse effects of different disorders. However, animals have drawbacks, such as cleanliness or allergies, that may not be present when using robotic systems. This paper presents a pet social robot designed to provide companionship and entertainment to older adults living in dependency. We describe its hardware and software, emphasising how it behaves from a biologically inspired approach to appear natural and provide a supportive experience.

 Demo of the Agri-RO5 Architecture for Agrirobot Fleet Simulation  
  The growing demand for sustainable and high-yield agriculture necessitates the deployment of autonomous, cost-effective, and resilient agricultural robot (agrirobot) fleets, particularly in labor-scarce rural areas with challenging working conditions. This paper presents the demo of the novel multi-agent architecture, Agri-RO5, for realistic simulation of dynamic agrirobot fleet coordination methods. The Agri-RO5 approach tackles the challenges in rural settings, including low connectivity and geographically dispersed farms. Our long-term goal is to develop digital twins to optimize real-world fleet performance. Agri-RO5 is implemented in Unity-3D, Robot Operating System (ROS), and an extension of the existing package Patrolling SIM to achieve high simulation fidelity representing real-world conditions. The integration allows the coordination solution into the controllers of actual physical robotic systems and ensures that simulations closely match real-world scenarios. Our system prioritizes a highly distributed architecture facilitated by incorporating SPADE3 and FIVE. SPADE3 provides a framework for developing and executing scalable multi-agent systems, while FIVE offers the creation of the environment and provides mechanisms to interact with the environment.

 Implementation of Real-Time Local Search Method for Distributed Constraint Optimization with Message Loss in Pub/Sub Communication  
  We develop an experimental environment to verify decentralized real-time optimization methods using publish/subscribe (pub/sub) communication with low QoS settings. Research on the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) explores fundamental combinatorial optimization problems in multiagent systems. However, the implementation of solution methods using practical communication systems requires further investigation. Recent robot control platforms and frameworks for IoT devices employ pub/sub communication models for relatively simple communication. A previous study addressed this situation and investigated a variant of an anytime local solution method for DCOPs allowing for temporarily missing agents in the solution process. We experimentally investigate this approach by implementing it in an environment of small board computers with an ROS2 framework. We also describe/verify the methodology of our practical experiment.

 Developing a Safe Autonomous Logistic System with vGOAL  
  In this demo, we present how to develop a safe autonomous decision-making component using vGOAL. We use a real-world autonomous logistic system involving three autonomous mobile robots as a case study. We demonstrate (1) vGOAL is used to specify autonomous decision-making; (2) the automated PCTL model-checking process of vGOAL is used to generate a sound vGOAL specification; (3) the vGOAL interpreter is used as a safe autonomous decision-making component.

   PacificVis 2024  
  
 Welcome to IEEE PacificVis 2024!  
 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis) was born in Kyoto in 2008 as an international event sponsored by IEEE Computer Society with the aim of promoting visualization research and technologies, especially in the Asian-Pacific region. Since then, we had a series of annual events in Beijing (2009), Taipei (2010), Hong Kong (2011), Songdo (2012), Sydney (2013), Yokohama (2014), Hangzhou (2015), Taipei (2016), Seoul (2017), Kobe (2018), Bangkok (2019), Tianjin (2020 and 2021, online), Tsukuba (2022, online), and Seoul (2023). The 17th event is scheduled to take place in Mita Campus  , Keio University  , Tokyo over April 23-26, 2024 with the co-sponsorship by the Faculty of Science and Technology  , Keio University  .  
 We are pleased to announce three significant changes we made this year. First of all, in recognition of the growth of PacificVis to date by the IEEE Computer Society and Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee, PacificVis was upgraded from a symposium to a conference. Second, the full-paper track of PacificVis was expanded into two independent subtracks: the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) track and the conference track, unlike in the past when we published only a few best papers selected from the conference track in a special section of the TVCG. Third and last, all the accepted papers from the Vis-Meets-AI Workshop  , which was held in conjunction with PacificVis so far since 2020, are now also included in the conference proceedings together with all accepted short papers in the track of Visualization Notes.  
 The conference program  also includes two keynote speeches by Prof. Huamin Qu  and Prof. Bongshin Lee  , as well as all the accepted Posters and Visual Data Storytelling Contest works  as in the previous year. In the morning of the first day, the 7th Japan-Korea-China Joint Visualization Workshop will be held as a collocated event. This workshop is free of charge for all registered participants of PacificVis 2024 and everyone is welcome to attend.  
 We hope that all participants will enjoy PacificVis 2024!

   Common Call for Papers  
  
 IEEE PacificVis 2024 solicits novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization. PacificVis is a unified visualization symposium covering topics such as information visualization, scientific visualization, visual analytics, and visualization applications in domains such as (but not limited to) biological sciences, education, machine learning, physical sciences, security, and social science.  
 IEEE PacificVis 2024 will be held in Tokyo, Japan on April 23-26, 2024. The symposium accepts a range of scientific contributions ranging from full research papers, short papers, and posters. This year, PacificVis has a TVCG journal paper track, a conference full paper track, and a short paper (VisNotes) track with consecutive deadlines. These tracks have separate calls for papers:  
 Call for papers - | TVCG journal papers 
  Call for papers - | Conference papers 
  Call for papers - | Short papers (VisNotes) 
  Call for papers - | Posters 
  The deadlines for the tracks are arranged so that papers rejected from an earlier track can be resubmitted to a following track (with optional reviewer continuity). All submitted papers except short papers (VisNotes) will go through a two-stage review process to guarantee the publication of high-quality papers. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference and will also be published by IEEE and included in the IEEE Digital Library  . Papers accepted in the journal track will be published directly in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)  .  
 Important Dates

 Paper Type and Topics  
 See the separate document on paper types and topics  of interest for IEEE PacificVis.  
 Submission Guidelines  
 When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the paper submission guidelines  .  
 Reviewing Process and Review Criteria  
 IEEE PacificVis papers undergo a rigorous review process over multiple rounds of reviewing (VisNotes have a slightly shorter review process). Some papers may be desk rejected—rejected before they enter this detailed peer reviewing—by the papers chairs if they determine that the submission is clearly out of scope for the conference, is written using poor language that precludes effective communication, does not follow the formatting guidelines, or is otherwise not appropriate.  
 Decisions after the first round of reviews are usually conditional acceptances or rejections. All conditionally accepted papers come with written requirements for final acceptance. Effectively addressing these requirements in a second round version of the paper is essential and the responsibility of the authors. Reviewers may sometimes communicate directly with authors to address minor points in the revised paper, effectively allowing for additional reviewing rounds. However, such additional communication is at the discretion of reviewers and not a requirement. If the revised version of a paper fails to address feedback to the satisfaction of the reviewers, the paper will ultimately be rejected after the second reviewing round.

 Abstract  
   
 The 16th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics (PACBB) aims to promote the interaction among the scientific community to discuss applications of CS/AI with an interdisciplinary character, exploring the interactions between subareas of CS/AI, bioinformatics, chemoinformatic and systems biology. The PACBB’22 technical programme includes ten papers of authors from many different countries (Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Spain and UK) and different subfields in bioinformatics and computational biology. All papers underwent a peer review selection: each paper was assessed by three different reviewers from an international panel composed of about 46 members from 11 countries. The quality of submissions was on average good, with an acceptance rate of approximately 60% (10 accepted papers from 15 submissions).

 High-throughput sequencing of small RNA molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) has become a widely used approach for studying gene expression and regulation. However, analyzing miRNA-Seq data can be challenging because it requires multiple steps, from quality control and preprocessing to differential expression and pathway-enrichment analyses, with many tools and databases available for each step. Furthermore, reproducibility of the analysis pipeline is crucial to ensure that the results are accurate and reliable. Here, we present myBrain-Seq, a comprehensive and reproducible pipeline for analyzing miRNA-Seq data that incorporates miRNA-specific solutions at each step of the analysis. The pipeline was designed to be flexible and user-friendly, allowing researchers with different levels of expertise to perform the analysis in a standardized and reproducible manner, using the most common and widely used tools for each step. In this work, we describe the implementation of myBrain-Seq and demonstrate its capacity to consistently and reproducibly identify differentially expressed miRNAs and enriched pathways by applying it to a real case study in which we compared schizophrenia patients who responded to medication with treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients to obtain a 16-miRNA treatment-resistant schizophrenia profile.

 Overview  
 The long tradition of PACLIC conferences emphasizes the synergy of theoretical analysis and processing of language - from theoretical frameworks to cognitive accounts, from lexical processing to language understanding, and from computational modelling to multi-lingual applications.  
 The most important purpose of PACLIC conferences is to provide a forum where researchers in different fields of language study in different areas in the Pacific-Asia region working on issues pertaining to different languages can come together and talk, get to know each other, learn old wisdom, be enlightened by new insights and generally get entertained intellectually, and come home ready to initiate a new research program with new research partners in a new state of mind.  
 We value hybrid talks on linguistic principles and implementation details, massive data collection and extraction of abstract rules, automated proficiency evaluation and philosophical contemplation on language learning, although pure theory and pure technology will also be appreciated. We welcome bi-lingual or multi-lingual research, while due respects will be paid to mono-lingual research.

  Paper Submission Information  
 Paper Submission and Templates  
 Please submit your papers to our Easychair platform  .  
 Papers must follow the ACL 2023 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded in Style Files and Formatting. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.  
 Verification  
 To guarantee conformance to publication standards, we will be using the ACL Pubcheck tool (https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck). The PDFs of camera-ready papers must be run through this tool prior to their final submission, and we recommend its use also at submission time.  
 Papers format  
 Paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included.  
 Papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, excluding references and appendices. Submissions will be judged based on relevance, technical strength, significance and opportunities, and interest to the attendees. As the reviewing will be double-blind, authors must not indicate their names and affiliations while submitting their papers.  
 Publication Information  
 Conference proceedings will be published in open-access digital formats. Past PACLIC proceeding papers have been indexed in Scopus (since PACLIC 19 in 2005) and listed in ACL Anthology. According to Google Scholar, PACLIC currently has an h5-index of 10 and the h5-median is 13.  
 Presentation Mode  
 Papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters.  
 Authorship  
 The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to PACLIC 2023 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to PACLIC 2023 after the abstract submission deadline.  
 Citation and Comparison  
 You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited). While not citing such unpublished works upon submission is not sufficient grounds for paper rejection, you are expected to cite such relevant work in camera ready, if notified about it by reviewers.  
 In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited instead of the preprint version. Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis. However, you are expected to mention such works in your submission, and list their published results if they are directly relevant.  
 For more information, see the ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation  .  
 Multiple Submission Policy  
 Double submissions with other conferences/workshops are allowed, but the authors are asked to declare it at submission time.  
 Ethics Policy  
 Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics  . The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work.  
 Optional Supplementary Materials  
 Appendices, Software and Data   
 Each PACLIC 2023 submission can be accompanied by an appendix, which will appear in the main paper’s PDF, after the bibliography. A submission may also be accompanied by one .tgz or .zip archive containing software, and one .tgz or .zip archive containing data. PACLIC 2023 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, anonymised related work (see above), preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.  
 Instructions For Double-Blind Review  
 As reviewing will be double blind, papers must not include authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references or links (such as github) that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”). If important citations are not available to reviewers (e.g., awaiting publication), these paper/s should be anonymised and included in the appendix. They can then be referenced from the submission without compromising anonymity. Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should also be anonymized.  
 Presentation Requirement  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference—either on-line or in-person—in order to appear in the proceedings. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at PACLIC 2023 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline if they wish to withdraw the paper.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register for PACLIC 2023 by the early registration deadline.  
 More information can be found in the Committee blog. If you have questions that are not answered there, please email the program co-chairs.  
 Hybrid Mode  
 PACLIC 2023 will be held in hybrid mode, both online and offline. Although, we encourage authors to attend in-person, if possible. PACLIC organizers will provide arrangements for streaming and remote presentation.

 Take your research further with SCHOLAT data   
   
 SROAD (SCHOLAT Research Open-Access Dataset) is designed to help academics and independent researchers advance research objectives on academic social network, SCHOLAT knowledge graph, smart education and other AI related fields.   

 Introduction  
 SCHOLAT is an emerging vertical social networking system designed and built specifically for scholars, learners and course instructors. The main goal of SCHOLAT is to enhance collaboration and social interactions focused around scholarly and learning discourses among the community of scholars. In addition to social networking capabilities, SCHOLAT incorporates various modules to encourage collaborative and interactive discussions, for example, chat, email, events, news posts, etc.

 Copyright Notice  
 Respect the privacy of personal information of the original source. 
  The original copyright of all the dataset belongs to "SCHOLAT Lab". "SCHOLAT Lab" collects, organizes, filters and purifies them. 
  If you want to use the dataset for depth study, data providers "SCHOLAT Lab" should be identified in your results. 
  The dataset is only for the specified applicant or study groups for research purposes. Without permission, it may not be used for any commercial purposes. 
  If the terms changed, the latest online version shall prevail. 
  1. SCHOLAT Social Network [Download]   
 Community is the implicit structure in social networks. In academic social networks, the users with similar or same research interests are more likely to be in the same community with close links and similar attributes. Effective community detection results can be further utilized for user analytics and user recommendation.  
 This dataset aims to fuse user links and attributes for community detection. The dataset mainly consists of three parts where contains 16,007 users and 202,248 links. (1) "attribute" directory contains 16,007 files which are user attributes with the user IDs as file names. (2) "links.txt" contains 202,248 lines and each line means that there exists one link (friendship, team members in the same research teams, or classmates in the same courses) between two users (represented as IDs) which are split by TAB. (3) "lexicons.txt" contains 25,817 words with 15,790 Chinese words and 10,027 English words, which constitutes all the user attributes.  
 BTW, the last version of this dataset has been successfully applied for the first ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (1 st  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 15 th  Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2020). View the details on https://www.scholat.com/confweb/CCSCW2020/big_data_competiton.jsp  . The difference between this version and the last version on ChineseCSCW Cup is that we extend more user links.

 2. SCHOLAT Link Prediction [Download]   
 Link prediction is an important research problem in academic social network analysis. It mines possible relationships among scholars by using existing network structure and external information. An effective link prediction method can support many personalized applications of academic social networks, including recommendation of scholars' friends/followers, completion/prediction of scholars' collaborative relationship, and recommendation of academic resources.  
 This dataset mainly contains the user attributes and links among 10,755 users from SCHOLAT. The "attribute" directory contains 10,755 files which are user attributes with the user IDs as file names. "train.csv", "dev.csv" and "test.csv" are 168540, 16854 and 16854 undirected edges respectively with the 2-column user nodes.  
 This dataset will be used for the second ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (2 nd  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 16th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2021).

 3. Anomaly Detection on Attributed Network [Download]   
 Anomaly detection on attributed networks is an important task in social network analysis. The goal is to find the anomalies that deviate significantly from the majority of the network in terms of some proximities, e.g. topological structure or attribute proximity. An effective anomaly detection can support many applications such as web spam detection, system fraud detection, network intrusion detection and representation learning.  
 This dataset is adopted for simultaneously detecting structure/attribute-abnormal nodes and motif instances. The nodes represent the scholars and the edges denote the message interactions between the two ending nodes. The breadth first search with random restart is used to craw the nodes. And the nodes of degree no larger than 50 are preserved. The node attribute vectors are extracted by means of applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on the brief biographies of the corresponding scholars. After preprocessing and subset selection, the SCHOLAT dataset contains 2,022 nodes, 2,500 edges and 329 triangle motif instances. The dimension of the node attribute vectors is 500. The number of the motif-augmented edges is 8,361.

 4. User-Generated Item Recommendation [Download]   
 Most of the existing recommendation methods assume that all the items are provided by separate producers, which is however not true in some recommendation tasks. That is, it is possible that some of the items are generated by users. Appropriately considering the user-item generation relation may bring benefit to some recommender systems, e.g., implicit recommender systems with only implicit user-item interactions.  
 In our paper in Knowledge-Based Systems 2022, we have proposed a new method called Deep Interaction-Attribute-Generation (DIAG) model, which integrates the user-item interaction relation, the user-item generation relation and the item attribute information into one deep learning framework. And we have collected two datasets, namely Scholat and Lizhi.  
 The Scholat dataset is a post recommendation dataset obtained from the scholar social network https://www.scholat.com/  . The scholars are taken as users and the posts are taken as items. Each post is generated by at most one scholar (i.e. user-item generation) and will be read by many scholars (i.e. user-item interaction). The item attribute vector is obtained by applying word2vec to the 0/1-valued word vector representing the absence/presence of each word in the title and content of the post. The dimension of the item attribute vector is 372. Only the users with no less than 2 interactions are preserved. After preprocessing, a subset consisting of 1991 users and 5008 items is obtained. The number of user-item interactions is 13960. The number of user-item generations is 3776.  
 The Lizhi dataset is an audio recommendation dataset obtained from the online audio platform https://www.lizhi.fm  . The normal users are taken as users and the audios are taken as items. Each audio is generated by at most one user (i.e. user-item generation) and will be listened to by many users (i.e. user-item interaction). The item attribute vector characterizes the key information of the audio, namely the gender and age of the user generating this audio, and the bag of words (BOW) representation of the tags of the audio. The dimension of the item attribute vectors is 514. Only users with at least 10 user-item interactions are preserved. After preprocessing, a subset consisting of 3716 users and 9205 items is obtained. The number of user-item interactions is 858124. The number of user-item generations is 5744.  
 The source code and data are available at https://www.scholat.com/datasetApplication.html?dataset=diag_recommendation  .

 5. SCHOLAT Interactive User Recommendation [Download]   
 Interactive recommender systems (IRS) have attracted more and more attention in recent years, which can receive user feedbacks on the recommendation list and constantly improve the recommendation results. This dataset contains 39,805 users and 680,267 historical interactions among them from SCHOLAT. The "user_attribute" directory contains 39,805 files which are user attributes with the user IDs (from 0 to 39,804) as file names. The user attributes are extracted from their biography in SCHOLAT and most of them are in Chinese. The file "user_interactions.txt" contains all the user interactions that are in the format as "User1::User2::Reward::Timestamp", where "User1" is the ID of user1, "User2" is the ID of user2, "Reward" represents the feedback or rating on user2 by user1, and "Timestamp" is the time at which this interaction happened. More specifically, if user1 clicks or browses user2's homepage, the reward is set as 1. If user1 follows user2, the reward is set as 3. If user1 unfollows user2, the reward is -1. All the user IDs range between 0 and 39,804.  
 This dataset will also be used for the third ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (3 rd  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 17th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2022).

 6. SCHOLAT Multiplex Network [Download]   
 The SCHOLAT Multiplex Network provides a comprehensive list of social information. In this network, we construct a multiplex structure with three layers: (1) The first layer represents connections between users who become friends. (2) The second layer represents connections between users who join the same groups. (3) The third layer represents connections between users who study the same courses. Furthermore, we define an individual ground-truth community based on the affiliation of users. All layers consist of the same 2,302 nodes with the highest quality. Each layer has a specific number of edges: 11,393 for the first layer, 139,004 for the second layer, and 70,226 for the third layer. We have divided these nodes into 11 communities.  
 This dataset will also be used for the fourth ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (4 th  ChineseCSCW Cup) on the 18th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2023).  
  
  7. SCHOLAT ScholarNet [Download]   
 This dataset contains the user attributes and links among 9,537 users from SCHOLAT. The "attributes" directory contains 9,537 user attribute files with the user IDs as file names. The links data is divided into two parts: "train.csv" and "test.csv", which respectively include 128,924 and 32,231 undirected edges.  
 This dataset will be used for the fifth ChineseCSCW Big Data Analytics Competition (5 th  CCSCW Cup) on the 19th Chinese Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (ChineseCSCW 2024).

  POPL 2025  ( series  ) /  PADL 2025 ( series  ) /  PADL 2025: The 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages  
   
 About 
  Accepted Papers 
  Call for Papers 
  Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming. Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real-world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems.  
 New developments in theory and implementation fostered applications in new areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel and challenging problems raise many interesting research issues, including designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well.  
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving.  
 Student grants  
 PADL 2025 encourages students to participate in the symposium by providing some student grants to partially cover the registration and travel costs. You can apply by filling out the following form before December 16  :  
 https://forms.gle/Xr4HfxgNRxUAy7jv9   
 The selection process will give preference to students who present their papers at the symposium. Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

 Call for Papers  
  
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, databases and constraint programming, and theorem proving.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Innovative applications of declarative languages 
  Declarative domain-specific languages and applications 
  Practical applications of theoretical results 
  New language developments and their impact on applications 
  Declarative languages and software engineering 
  Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications 
  Practical experiences and industrial applications 
  Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom 
  Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages 
  PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design, and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem-proving methods that rely on declarative languages.  
 PADL 2025 encourages students to participate in the symposium by providing some student grants to partially cover the registration and travel costs. The selection process will give preference to students who present their paper in the symposium. Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.  
 Submissions   
 PADL 2025 welcomes regular papers (max. 15 pages, excluding references)  and short papers (max. 8 pages, excluding references)  that describe original and previously unpublished research results on  
 complex and/or real-world applications in industry or in other areas of research, that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages, 
  tools and/or systems developed for such applications, and/or to improve practical aspects of declarative languages, 
  technical results related to the practical aspects of declarative languages. 
  Application and systems descriptions, engineering solutions, and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are in particular solicited. Regular and short papers will be published in the formal proceedings.  
 PADL 2025 also welcomes extended abstracts (max. 3 pages)  on the topics above, that describe new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication. Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings.  
 All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, see https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   
 The review process of PADL 2025 is double-anonymous  . In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgments that might identify you.  
 Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.  
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:  
 \pagestyle{plain} \usepackage{lineno} \linenumbers    The conference proceedings of PADL 2025 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published Workshop proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared. Previous PADL proceedings  can be found on SpringerLink  .  
 Papers should be submitted electronically via EquinOCS  (registration is required if you do not have an account).  
 Distinguished Papers   
 The authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)  , and for papers related to functional programming, in Journal of Functional Programming (JFP)  . The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended: explanations for which there was no space, illuminating examples and proofs, additional definitions and theorems, further experimental results, implementational details and feedback from practical/engineering use, extended discussion of related work, and so on. These submissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process by the journal, although with the aim of a swifter review process by reusing original reviews from PADL.

 POPL 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 will be invited to present their work in the POPL conference in January 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
 Scope   
 Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing technical papers can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  .  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 POPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process (similar to the one used for POPL 2023 and 2024 but different from the lightweight double-blind process used in previous years). This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers. The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences for authors.  
 Submissions:  Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions. In addition, references to authors’ own prior work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  Supplementary material:  Authors are permitted to provide supplementary material (e.g., detailed proofs, proof scripts, system implementations, or experimental data) along with their submission, which reviewers may (but are not required to) examine. This material may take the form of a single file, such as a PDF or a tarball. Authors must fully anonymize any supplementary material. 
  Author response:  In responding to reviews, authors should not say anything that reveals their identity, since author identities will not be revealed to reviewers at that stage of the reviewing process. 
  Dissemination of work under submission:  Authors are welcome to disseminate their ideas and post draft versions of their paper(s) on their personal website, institutional repository, or arXiv (reviewers will be asked to turn off arXiv notifications during the review period). But authors should not take steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities to members of the Program Committee, e.g., directly contacting PC members or publicizing the work on widely-visible social media or major mailing lists used by the community. 
  The purpose of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors’ identities if they were to try. In particular, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the quality of the submission.  
 However, there are occasionally cases where adhering to the above restrictions is truly difficult or impossible for one reason or another. In such cases, the authors should contact the Program Chair  to discuss the situation and how to handle it.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  addresses many common scenarios and answers many common questions about this topic. But there remain many grey areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules or you encounter a complex case that is not clearly covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Evaluation Process   
 Like last year, POPL 2025 will use a double-blind reviewing process (instead of the lightweight double-blind process used in recent years). This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. For authors, the main change is that there is no option to upload non-anonymized supplementary material; only anonymized supplementary material may be submitted.  
 POPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.  
 As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.  
 The Review Committee (RC) will discuss papers electronically, and will use synchronous virtual meetings to discuss any papers for which there is disagreement among reviewers, in some cases soliciting additional input from other experts in the committee. There is no formal External Review Committee, though experts outside the committee may be consulted for some papers. Reviews will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee’s decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the decision.  
 To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL papers will be conditionally accepted; authors will be required to submit a short description of the changes made to the final version of the paper, including how the changes address any requirements imposed by the Review Committee. That the changes are sufficient will be confirmed by the original reviewers prior to acceptance to POPL. Authors of conditionally accepted papers must submit a satisfactory revision to the Review Committee by the requested deadline or risk rejection.  
 For additional information about the reviewing process, see: Principles of POPL  , a presentation of the underlying organizational and reviewing policies for POPL. For POPL 2025, policies specified in this Call for Papers supersede those in the Principles of POPL document.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://popl25.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Program Chair (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM July 11, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Conflicts of Interest   
 For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as “Other Conflicts (external)”. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace.  
 Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and proposals; for two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large companies or different locations of research institutes are considered to be the same institution; for two years after leaving an institution), between people with financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or relatives.  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Prior to the paper submission deadline, authors should upload their full anonymized paper. Here are some key requirements concerning paper submissions:  
 Each paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the acmart  LaTeX class with acmsmall  option). It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. The PACMPL template for LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  , and further information about PACMPL submissions can be found on the PACMPL author guidelines page  . PACMPL does not support submissions in Microsoft Word. 
  We strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options in order to make submissions easier to review. 
  ( NEW this year  ) Authors may choose which citation format they wish to use, which can be either author-year (the mandate for final versions in previous years) or numeric. 
  Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. 
  Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism  . Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. 
  Authors are free to submit supplementary material along with their submissions, but it must be fully anonymized. 
  Authors must list all their conflicts of interest (both PC conflicts and external conflicts) in the HotCRP submission form. 
  Authors may include additional information in a field of the HotCRP submission form labeled “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair”. This information need not be anonymized. It can be used to inform the Program Chair, for example, about sensitive issues concerning a conflict with a PC member or about supplementary material that cannot be anonymized. It is left to the discretion of the Program Chair what to do with this information. 
  If for some reason an author feels uncomfortable discussing a sensitive issue with the Program Chair (or communicating via the “Confidential Comments” field in HotCRP), they should feel free to get in touch instead with any of the Associate Chairs, with whom they can discuss the issue in confidence. 
  Submissions from PC members (except the Program Chair) are permitted and will not be handled any differently than other submissions. This is in accordance with a recent change in policy approved by the SIGPLAN Executive Committee: SIGPLAN conferences that use full double-blind review and whose PCs have at least 50 members need not hold PC submissions to a higher standard. 
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact submission is strongly encouraged but voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Copyright, Publication, and Presentation   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license  , which grants readers liberal (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a | Creative Commons license | , retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Authors of accepted papers are encouraged (but not required) to give a short talk (roughly 25 minutes long) at the conference, according to the conference schedule.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 At most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The selection of the distinguished papers will be made based on the final version of the paper and through an additional review process.  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science conferences have embraced double-blind reviewing. POPL has used double-blind reviewing for several years now as stipulated in the Principles of POPL  .  
 Q: Why are you using full  double-blind reviewing instead of lightweight  double-blind reviewing?   
 A: For about a decade, POPL used lightweight double-blind review (double-blind until PC members submit reviews). For POPL 2023, the conference switched to full double-blind review (double-blind until conditional acceptance). There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches, but based on our experience so far, the benefits of full-double blind seem to outweight the drawbacks.  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is relatively rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Yes, but we have mechanisms in place to prevent such an injustice from occurring. Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect. Moreover, if authors believe that their paper is being misjudged due to the constraints of double-blind review, they should feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity, and avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 If you believe for some reason that it is impossible to anonymize your paper without significantly weakening it, please feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair to discuss the situation.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository or I would like to provide a link to an online demo. How do I deal with this?   
 A: We discourage the use of external links, but sometimes the most convenient way to share suplementary material such as code or datasets is to include a link to a github repository or a google drive, but it is very important that they are fully anonymized. In particular, a link to your working code repository that exposes the identities of the contributors will be in violation of the double blind policy.  
 The same holds for online demos; reviewers should be able to visit the online demo and potentially browse its source code without being exposed to the identity of the authors (watch out for copyright statements, for example).  
 You should keep in mind that reviewers are under no obligation to review any supplementary material, including externally linked data or code, and reviewers may chose not to visit any externally linked material.  
 Needless to say, attempting to discover the reviewers for your paper by tracking visitors to a public repository or an online demo would constitute a breach of academic integrity.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: No. The relationship between systems and authors changes over time, so there will be at least some doubt about authorship. Increasing this doubt by changing the system name would help with anonymity, but it would compromise the research process. In particular, changing the name requires explaining a lot about the system again because you can’t just refer to the existing papers, which use the proper name. Not citing these papers runs the risk of the reviewers who know about the existing system thinking you are replicating earlier work. It is also confusing for the reviewers to read about the paper under Name X and then have the name be changed to Name Y. Will all the reviewers go and re-read the final version with the correct name? If not, they have the wrong name in their heads, which could be harmful in the long run.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: If the previous workshop publication resulted in a published paper, then your POPL submission will be judged on the significance of its delta with respect to that earlier paper. In that case, you should definitely cite the earlier paper as you would any other paper (i.e., in the third person, not revealing that you were the author of the earlier paper) and explain the delta. If, on the other hand, the work presented at an earlier workshop was not accompanied by a proper publication (e.g., if it was just a talk), then your POPL submission may very well have significant overlap with it and citing the workshop work would effectively unblind your paper. In such a case, it is not necessary to cite the earlier presentation. Instead, please mention it in the “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair” field of the HotCRP form so that the Program Chair is aware of the situation. When in doubt, ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: I want to cite some related work that itself cites an earlier version of my paper/system that appeared previously online. But that would effectively unblind my submission. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: My submission presents a technique that I employed in the development of previous papers but which was never properly described in those papers. If I mention that my technique was used in those previous papers, I am effectively unblinding my submission, but if I don’t mention it, reviewers may think I am ripping off my own prior work. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between (1) the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and (2) actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may  do:  
 Submit your paper to POPL, even if a previous version of it – under the same title or a different title – has been presented at an informal workshop, published on arXiv, or submitted to a previous conference or workshop. 
  Post your submission on your home page, your institutional repository, or arXiv, before or after the deadline (under whatever title you want). 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the PC, or with PC members with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, informal workshops, or job interviews during the POPL review period. 
  The above is not an exhaustive list: when in doubt, ask the Program Chair.  
 Things you should not  do:  
 Contact PC members (with whom you are not conflicted) about your work. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, POPL paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Chair.  
 Q: Will the fact that POPL is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call for papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective POPL author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: You should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, as explained above, it is fine for authors to give talks about their work (at workshops, job interviews, etc.), they cannot control who will attend their talks, and you as a PC member should not feel that you are prevented from attending their talks. Knowing (for whatever reason) that a paper was written by a certain author does not prevent you from reviewing the paper.  
 That said, if you feel that the authors’ actions are in flagrant violation of double-blind review, that is a point of concern. For example, if an author e-mails you their brand new POPL submission and asks to visit your institution to discuss it, that would clearly not be appropriate. There is a grey zone here, so use your best judgment, and when in doubt, ask the Program Chair how to proceed.  
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: You are under no obligation to follow any URLs to external supplementary material. If the submission is not self contained and does not convince you by itself about its merits, then the paper should not be accepted. If you ever have reason to suspect that your anonymity was compromised through your following of a link, please share that information with the PC chair immediately, as this would constitute a breach of academic integrity on the part of the authors.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers, e.g., you don’t feel completely qualified to review them, or if you know someone who would be the perfect reviewer for the paper, then bring this to the attention of the Associate Chair handling your paper, and discuss with them potential external reviewers (or other PC members) who might be able to provide an expert review. Then, submit a review for the paper that is as careful as possible, pointing out the areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. The Associate Chairs will manage the process of ensuring that papers receive sufficient expert reviews; please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. It is critical that you enter these at least a week before the POPL submission deadline. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, avoid using search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed.  
  These guidelines are largely based on guidelines for POPL 2023  , with a few modifications by Derek Dreyer based on discussions with the POPL Steering Committee. The earlier guidelines evolved from guidelines used at POPL and PLDI for a number of years, which originated in guidelines created by Mike Hicks for POPL 2012.

 The 10th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT'01), was held in the Barcelona Hilton Hotel. PACT'01 offered a high quality technical program, including three outstanding keynote speakers (Randall D. Isaac, IBM; Justin Rattner and Joel Emer, both from Intel), 26 cutting-edge research papers, and a special session on Work in Progress. It also included workshops on OpenMP, Binary Translation, Memory Access Decoupled Architectures, Compilers and Operating Systems for Low Power, and Ubiquitous Computing. A tutorial on the IBM Research Jalapeño JVM was also included in the technical program.   
 211 delegates attended PACT'01 and its workshops. Out of this number, 146 registered for the main event and 65 delegates registered for "workshops/tutorials only". I would like to thank all delegates for traveling to lovely Barcelona. I hope that the city was able to transmit the charm of its people, monuments and museums.   
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee of PACT'01, I would like to thank to everybody who collaborated in its making.  The conference received some funding for student travel grants through generous corporate sponsorship. The hosting university (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya UPC), public institutions and corporations (also provided funds to sponsor the activities of the conference. We gratefully thank them for their generous support.
