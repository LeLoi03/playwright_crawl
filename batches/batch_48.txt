 About   
 The 15th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) conference  will take place at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing on the University of California, Berkeley campus. It will be held in person  from Tuesday, January 30 to Friday February 2, 2024. The conference will run in a single track and all sessions will take place at the Calvin Lab auditorium.  
 ITCS seeks to promote research that carries a strong conceptual message (e.g., introducing a new concept, model or understanding, opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies; new applications of known techniques). ITCS welcomes both conceptual and technical contributions whose contents will advance and inspire the greater theory community.  
 For participants requiring local accommodations, find our recommended list of options here  .

 Circles | Call for Proposals  
   
 The Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing is pleased to partner with Jane Street in establishing Circles, the Simons Institute – Jane Street Small Group Collaborations.  
 What:  The program will support groups of three to six researchers for four weeklong visits spread over two years to collaborate intensely on an ambitious research project. The program will cover travel and lodging and provide office space during these weeks.  
 When and where:  One week at the Simons Institute at UC Berkeley (anticipated in early December) and one week at Jane Street in New York (anticipated during the summer months), each year for two years.  
 Who:  The group should include at least one person working in theoretical computer science. While we continue to support proposals in core theoretical computer science, one of our missions is to expand the field of theory of computing and encourage interdisciplinary collaborations as well as proposals from junior researchers.  
 We are particularly excited to receive proposals that tie into our programming each year, but we hope to accept proposals across a broad range of areas. It may be worth looking at our semester programs  to get an idea of the kinds of topics we support.  
 Applications will be considered on a rolling basis, up to six months before the beginning of the collaboration. To apply, please submit a proposal that includes:  
 Project title 
  List of committed participants and their affiliations, as well as a short CV for each 
  Scientific agenda of the collaboration, explaining its impact and timeliness, and how it fits with the mission of the Simons Institute (limit: 2 pages) 
  Past collaborations and synergies among the participants, indicating why the group would benefit from the program (limit: 1 page) 
  Proposals may be submitted here  .

 ITiCSE 2025 (30 June-2 July, Netherlands)  

 Welcome to the 30th annual ACM  conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). ITiCSE conference is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computing Education (SIGCSE)  , in collaboration with the ACM Europe Council  , and Informatics Europe  . ITiCSE 2025 will take place in Radboud University, Netherlands.  
 Call for Participation    

 Welcome to Nijmegen   
 Nijmegen is a city in the east of the Netherlands. It is located close to the German border, and at the same time very well-connected with both the Dutch capital Amsterdam and the nearby national airport.  
 Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands, with a city center full of important historical locations. Nijmegen was founded by the Romans as an important base because of its strategic location. The city of Nijmegen is exciting, interesting, and has a turbulent history.  
 And it’s not just a rich cultural history that Nijmegen has to offer. Nijmegen is a lively city with many cozy restaurants, bars and terraces that give the city a young vibe. Furthermore, you can find examples of modern architecture. For instance, a spectacular water management project ‘Room for the River’ was completed a few years ago, involving a change of the course of the river and the creation of an artificial island.  
 Conference venue   
 The ITICSE 2025 conference will take place at Radboud University. The green campus of the university is located outside the city center of Nijmegen and is easily accessible by bike or public transport. Radboud University is a broad university where research and education go hand in hand. Students and staff members feel connected to each other, to society, and to the world around them. For the conference, we are happy to welcome you at the Faculty of Science, in the modern Huygens Building.

 Call for Papers  

 This page provides detailed information about paper submissions to the ITiCSE 2025 conference. It is part of the general Call for Participation  which you should read first, if you have not yet done so.  
 If you have questions that neither this page nor the Call for Participation  can answer, please contact the program chairs  .  
 ITiCSE 2025 paper tracks   
 Papers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing.  
 Note that an abstract submission  is mandatory for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers.  
 When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks. Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct track. Authors are advised to look at the review guidelines  for their paper track, so as to know what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing the submission. Papers will be reviewed according to the track to which they were submitted, and it will not be moved between tracks.  
 Computing education research | : papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t; 
  Position papers and proposals | : papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right. 
   
  All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention. Initial submissions must be anonymous.  
 Submitting the abstract   
 Your abstract can be up to 250 words and must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for these dates  )  . The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field.  
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers that they are qualified to review and interested in reviewing. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that you believe will best describe the finished paper.  
 Anonymous version for review   
 Please read this section carefully to avoid the unfortunate situation of a desk rejection.  
 The paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version  so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed: this includes authors’ names; authors’ affiliations; any information in the body or the headers of the paper that might identify the authors or their institutions, such as websites, related publications, or specific geographic locations; and acknowledgements, which often include material that might identify the authors. Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know that the authors are citing themselves. For example, instead of “We reported on our first experiment in 2018 [13]”, the paper might say “An early experiment in this area was carried out in 2018 [13]”, or “Katchen and Satie [13] carried out an early experiment in this area in 2018”. If a paper is presenting software that is the work of the authors, the name of the software should be anonymised, so that it will not be found with a web search.  
 When writing the review version of the paper, space should be left for the authors’ names, affiliations, and other material that might need to be added, such as the ACM reference format  . This can be implemented either by the use of placeholders or simply by ensuring that the paper is sufficiently short of the page limit. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit.  
 Papers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason, they should not include links to additional material  , such as a demonstration of software being introduced.  
 If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, affiliations, citations, acknowledgements, and references, and that may, if appropriate, include links to supplementary information.  
 We are aware that some authors publish their papers prior to submission in places such as arXiv, with full author details. This is permitted according to ACM policy  . However, this does breach anonymity as such papers can easily be found by a reviewer looking for background on the subject matter. In view of this, we recommend submitting to arXiv or such sites with a different title and abstract than the submitted (review) version to cut down on “accidental” discoveries of papers on arXiv that would compromise anonymity.  
 Ethical status of data collection   
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.  
 Formatting the paper   
 The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references. Note that this is not the same as seven pages: if there is a seventh page, there must be nothing on it but references.  
 If the paper includes figures and tables, the text in them must be readable at 100% magnification and in greyscale. Figures and tables must be readable if the paper is printed.  
 For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, see Formatting requirements  on the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please ensure that the file to be submitted is no more than 10MB in size. When files are this size and more, it is typically because the authors have pasted in high-resolution images and simply scaled them down, rather than reducing the file size before inserting the image.  
 Important dates   
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right or at Important Dates  page  
 Submitting the paper   
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your paper because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!  
 When the paper is fully anonymous and ready for review, convert it to Adobe PDF format. Please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the properties of the PDF file.  
 Return to the online submission system using the link on the call for participation  page, select the entry for your paper, and click a link in the upper right of the page to add or update the file.  
 After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy.  
 Please note:  ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings. See our full policy  for more information.

 Call for Papers  

 This page provides detailed information about paper submissions to the ITiCSE 2025 conference. It is part of the general Call for Participation  which you should read first, if you have not yet done so.  
 If you have questions that neither this page nor the Call for Participation  can answer, please contact the program chairs  .  
 ITiCSE 2025 paper tracks   
 Papers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing.  
 Note that an abstract submission  is mandatory for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers.  
 When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks. Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct track. Authors are advised to look at the review guidelines  for their paper track, so as to know what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing the submission. Papers will be reviewed according to the track to which they were submitted, and it will not be moved between tracks.  
 Computing education research | : papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t; 
  Position papers and proposals | : papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right. 
   
  All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention. Initial submissions must be anonymous.  
 Submitting the abstract   
 Your abstract can be up to 250 words and must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for these dates  )  . The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field.  
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers that they are qualified to review and interested in reviewing. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that you believe will best describe the finished paper.  
 Anonymous version for review   
 Please read this section carefully to avoid the unfortunate situation of a desk rejection.  
 The paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version  so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed: this includes authors’ names; authors’ affiliations; any information in the body or the headers of the paper that might identify the authors or their institutions, such as websites, related publications, or specific geographic locations; and acknowledgements, which often include material that might identify the authors. Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know that the authors are citing themselves. For example, instead of “We reported on our first experiment in 2018 [13]”, the paper might say “An early experiment in this area was carried out in 2018 [13]”, or “Katchen and Satie [13] carried out an early experiment in this area in 2018”. If a paper is presenting software that is the work of the authors, the name of the software should be anonymised, so that it will not be found with a web search.  
 When writing the review version of the paper, space should be left for the authors’ names, affiliations, and other material that might need to be added, such as the ACM reference format  . This can be implemented either by the use of placeholders or simply by ensuring that the paper is sufficiently short of the page limit. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit.  
 Papers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason, they should not include links to additional material  , such as a demonstration of software being introduced.  
 If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, affiliations, citations, acknowledgements, and references, and that may, if appropriate, include links to supplementary information.  
 We are aware that some authors publish their papers prior to submission in places such as arXiv, with full author details. This is permitted according to ACM policy  . However, this does breach anonymity as such papers can easily be found by a reviewer looking for background on the subject matter. In view of this, we recommend submitting to arXiv or such sites with a different title and abstract than the submitted (review) version to cut down on “accidental” discoveries of papers on arXiv that would compromise anonymity.  
 Ethical status of data collection   
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.  
 Formatting the paper   
 The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references. Note that this is not the same as seven pages: if there is a seventh page, there must be nothing on it but references.  
 If the paper includes figures and tables, the text in them must be readable at 100% magnification and in greyscale. Figures and tables must be readable if the paper is printed.  
 For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, see Formatting requirements  on the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please ensure that the file to be submitted is no more than 10MB in size. When files are this size and more, it is typically because the authors have pasted in high-resolution images and simply scaled them down, rather than reducing the file size before inserting the image.  
 Important dates   
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right or at Important Dates  page  
 Submitting the paper   
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your paper because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!  
 When the paper is fully anonymous and ready for review, convert it to Adobe PDF format. Please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the properties of the PDF file.  
 Return to the online submission system using the link on the call for participation  page, select the entry for your paper, and click a link in the upper right of the page to add or update the file.  
 After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy.  
 Please note:  ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings. See our full policy  for more information.

 Note that an abstract submission  is mandatory for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers.  
 When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks. Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct track. Authors are advised to look at the review guidelines  for their paper track, so as to know what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing the submission. Papers will be reviewed according to the track to which they were submitted, and it will not be moved between tracks.  
 Computing education research | : papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t; 
  Position papers and proposals | : papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right. 
   
  All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention. Initial submissions must be anonymous.  
 Submitting the abstract   
 Your abstract can be up to 250 words and must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for these dates  )  . The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field.  
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers that they are qualified to review and interested in reviewing. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that you believe will best describe the finished paper.  
 Anonymous version for review   
 Please read this section carefully to avoid the unfortunate situation of a desk rejection.  
 The paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version  so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed: this includes authors’ names; authors’ affiliations; any information in the body or the headers of the paper that might identify the authors or their institutions, such as websites, related publications, or specific geographic locations; and acknowledgements, which often include material that might identify the authors. Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know that the authors are citing themselves. For example, instead of “We reported on our first experiment in 2018 [13]”, the paper might say “An early experiment in this area was carried out in 2018 [13]”, or “Katchen and Satie [13] carried out an early experiment in this area in 2018”. If a paper is presenting software that is the work of the authors, the name of the software should be anonymised, so that it will not be found with a web search.  
 When writing the review version of the paper, space should be left for the authors’ names, affiliations, and other material that might need to be added, such as the ACM reference format  . This can be implemented either by the use of placeholders or simply by ensuring that the paper is sufficiently short of the page limit. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit.  
 Papers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason, they should not include links to additional material  , such as a demonstration of software being introduced.  
 If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, affiliations, citations, acknowledgements, and references, and that may, if appropriate, include links to supplementary information.  
 We are aware that some authors publish their papers prior to submission in places such as arXiv, with full author details. This is permitted according to ACM policy  . However, this does breach anonymity as such papers can easily be found by a reviewer looking for background on the subject matter. In view of this, we recommend submitting to arXiv or such sites with a different title and abstract than the submitted (review) version to cut down on “accidental” discoveries of papers on arXiv that would compromise anonymity.  
 Ethical status of data collection   
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.  
 Formatting the paper   
 The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references. Note that this is not the same as seven pages: if there is a seventh page, there must be nothing on it but references.  
 If the paper includes figures and tables, the text in them must be readable at 100% magnification and in greyscale. Figures and tables must be readable if the paper is printed.  
 For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, see Formatting requirements  on the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please ensure that the file to be submitted is no more than 10MB in size. When files are this size and more, it is typically because the authors have pasted in high-resolution images and simply scaled them down, rather than reducing the file size before inserting the image.  
 Important dates   
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right or at Important Dates  page  
 Submitting the paper   
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your paper because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!  
 When the paper is fully anonymous and ready for review, convert it to Adobe PDF format. Please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the properties of the PDF file.  
 Return to the online submission system using the link on the call for participation  page, select the entry for your paper, and click a link in the upper right of the page to add or update the file.  
 After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy.  
 Please note:  ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings. See our full policy  for more information.

 History  
   
 The ITP conference series is dedicated to interactive theorem proving and related topics, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification security, and formalization of mathematics. The inaugural meeting of ITP was held on 11 to 14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9 to 21 July 2010). ITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009.  
 The TPHOLs Conference Series  
 TPHOLs 2009 was the twenty-second in a series of international conferences on the applications of higher-order logic theorem proving. The first three (two at Cambridge and one at Århus) were informal users' meetings for the HOL system and were the only ones without published papers. Between 1991 and 1995 (Davis, Leuven Vancouver, Malta, Utah) the conference entertained an increasingly wide field of interest.  
 The evolution resulted in the program committee for the meeting in Turku (1996) deeming that the scope of the conference included all reasoning tools for higher-order logics and adopting the name TPHOLs, an acronym for Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics. (The final letter was considered necessary to break the direct connection between the conference and the HOL system.) This decision was strongly endorsed at the business sessions at Turku and Murray Hill (1997).  
 Traditions  
 A long-standing convention is that the annual conference should be held in a continent different to the location of the previous meeting. Another tradition is that the organizers for each meeting handle all aspects of the conference for the whole year in consultation with the previous few organizers. This includes selection of the program committee, editing the proceedings fund-raising, program, and local arrangements. Another responsibility of the organizers in year n  is to call for bids and conduct a poll for the selection of the venue for the conference in year n  + 1.

  History 

 History of ITP Conference Series  

 The Itp conference series  

 the tphols conference series  

 I TP 2012 is the third conference on Interactive Theorem Proving and related, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification, security, and formalization of mathematics.  

 The inaugural meeting of ITP was held on 11-14 July 2010 in Edinburgh Scotland, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9-21 July 2010).  

 ITP is the evolution of the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009.    

 TPHOLs 2009 was the twenty-second in a series of international conferences on the applications of higher order logic theorem proving.  
   
 The first three (two at Cambridge and one at Århus) were informal users' meetings for the HOL system and were the only ones without published papers. Between 1991 and 1995 (Davis, Leuven, Vancouver, Malta, Utah) the conference entertained an increasingly wide field of interest.  
   
 The evolution resulted in the program committee for the meeting in Turku (1996) deeming that the scope of the conference included all reasoning tools for higher order logics and adopted the name TPHOLs, being an acronym for Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics. (The final letter being considered necessary to break the direct connection between the conference and the HOL system.) This decision was strongly endorsed at the business sessions at Turku and Murray Hill (1997).  
   
 An extensive collection of links to various aspects of previous conferences in the series may be found below.  

 associated communities  

 An inspection of the proceedings of recent conferences show that the conference accommodates the user communities of a number of theorem proving systems that support higher order logics. The interested reader is referred to the web sites for the following provers:  

 Abella  - Agda  - ACL2  - Coq  - HOL  - Epigram  - IMPS  - Isabelle  - LEGO  - Matita  - Nuprl  - ProofPower  - PVS  - TPS   

 traditions  

 A longstanding convention is that the annual conference should be held in a continent different to the location of the previous meeting.  
   
 Another tradition is that the organizers for each meeting handle all aspects of the conference for the whole year in consultation with the previous few organizers. This includes selection of the programme committee, editing the proceedings, fund-raising, programme and local arrangements.  
   
 Another responsibility of the organizers in year n is to call for bids and conduct a poll for the selection of the venue for the conference in year n+1.

 Call for Participation  

 Participate in ITiCSE 2025!  
 We warmly invite colleagues from around the world to present their work through the submission of papers, working groups, panels, posters, and tips, techniques, & courseware. The conference provides an environment for sharing, exchanging, and discussing new ideas related to computing education, at all levels of instruction. ITiCSE will also host a doctoral consortium.  
 ITiCSE 2025 will be an in-person conference. There will not be facilities for either presenters or audience to attend virtually. In line with SIGCSE conference policy, at least one author of each paper, poster, and tips, techniques, & courseware, and all members of working groups, panels, and the doctoral consortium, are required to attend the conference and to present and discuss their contribution.  
 Each type of submission is described briefly on this page, and in more detail on its own page.  
 Policies  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc  ), including the policy on research involving human participants and subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Please also review the ACM authorship policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship  ).  
 See the ITiCSE policies page ( https://iticse.acm.org/policies/  ) for more information on these and other relevant policies.  
 Ethical status of data collection  
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.

 * Paper submission requires a mandatory submission of an abstract of up to 250 words by an earlier deadline.   Submissions to ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing. ITiCSE generally does not accept papers about applications of computing technology in education generally or in other specific areas of education, such as the development of software to make it easier for students to learn chemistry.  
 Submissions in the Paper category are to be anonymous, for dual-anonymous review. Anonymity is not required for any of the other submission types.  
 Call for submissions  
 Submissions may describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or a tool used for computing education or computing education research.  
 Within the domain of computing education, submissions will cover specific educational subject matter, including but not limited to:  
 pedagogies for enhancing learning in computing subject areas, such as programming, database systems, physical computing, or computer security; 
  leveraging data and analytics to improve learning; 
  use of technologies with specific application to computing education; 
  approaches to peer learning and novel educational methods; 
  social and global challenges in computing education; 
  broadening participation and diversity; 
  developing, implementing, or evaluating computing programs, curricula, and courses; 
  approaches to group work or class infrastructure; 
  teacher skills, teacher education, and teacher professional development. 
  Call for papers  
 An ITiCSE paper is a document up to six pages long, with a seventh page available for references if required. Submissions will fall into one of three categories, each having a dedicated submission track with specific expectations for papers in that track.  
 Computing education research: | papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; 
  Position papers and proposal | s: papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages. 
  The submission deadline for abstracts is one week before the final submission. It will not be possible to submit a paper if the abstract is not submitted by the abstract submission deadline.  
 For more detail see the Papers page  , and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for working groups  
 An ITiCSE working group is an intense collaboration between five to ten researchers from around the world to produce a high-value report on a topic of interest in computing education. The work is conducted remotely before and after the conference, and in person for the three days immediately preceding the conference itself. The working group report is subjected to rigorous review. Accepted working group reports are published well after the main conference proceedings. A working group begins with a proposal by up to three leaders. The proposals are reviewed by the working group chairs, who decide which proposals can proceed to recruit members.  
 For more details see the Working groups  page, and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for panels  
 A panel is a discussion among nominated panelists on a specified topic, typically occupying a 60-minute session, with at least a third of that time allocated for audience participation. A panel submission is a two-page document including a succinct summary of the different perspectives of the proposed participants, in a form suitable for inclusion in the proceedings. The submission must include the authors’ names.  
 For more detail see the Panels page  , and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for posters  
 A submission for a poster is a one-page paper. It is expected that this will include title, authors, abstract and keywords, with the rest of the page consisting of an extended abstract. The nature of the content will vary from poster to poster, but is expected to describe the main topic of the poster and to include references as appropriate. The submission must include the authors’ names.  
 For more detail see the Posters page,  and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for tips, techniques, and courseware  
 A two-page submission for tips, techniques, and courseware will be a summary description of a tip, technique, or courseware to be demonstrated in a conference session. It will be in a form suitable for inclusion in the proceedings. The submission must include authors’ names.  
 For more detail see the Tips, techniques, and courseware  page ,  and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 Call for doctoral consortium participation  
 The doctoral consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral candidates studying computing education to explore and develop their research interests in a workshop environment with a panel of established researchers in the field. This is an excellent opportunity to get feedback on a research topic, or ideas on future direction, from senior researchers in the field.  
 For more detail see the Doctoral Consortium  page, and the submission details  at the bottom of this page.  
 General submission details  
 Be sure that your submissions abide by the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  .  
  
  Be sure when making a submission to EasyChair submission platform that all authors are included. The ACM and ITiCSE are not generally receptive to changes in the author list once a submission has been accepted.  
 Documents submitted for review should be high quality, unpublished, original work. The official language of the conference is English, and submissions for review should be written in good academic English. The entire proceedings will be available in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Note that reviewers will assume they are reviewing completed works, as they will eventually appear in the conference proceedings. Do not submit incomplete drafts!  
 Page limits and deadlines for submissions are dependent upon the category of submission.  
 Electronic submission is required. All submissions must be PDF files. Where anonymous submissions are required, please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the PDF file.  
 Formatting requirements  
 All submissions must adhere to the ITiCSE 2025 formatting instructions. Templates for submissions can be found at the ACM SIG Proceedings website  .  
 The proceedings page incorporates two different approaches: the existing templates and the new workflow model. Please note that the new workflow model is “for specified conferences only” and ITiCSE 2025 is not one of the specified conferences  . Submitting authors are required to use the existing templates: for Word authors, the ‘Interim template’; for LaTeX authors, acmart.cls version 2.00 as updated in November 2023, or a more recent update if provided, with the sigconf option. A LaTeX template can also be found on Overleaf  . If you find that the template is producing a single-column format, it is likely that you are not using the sigconf option. A command near the beginning of your file should read \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}   
 The interim Word template is not generally considered easy to use, and it can be difficult to coerce it to produce a paper that conforms to the requirements. Authors who use Microsoft Word should be prepared for a significant challenge in getting an accepted paper to conform with the requirements ready for inclusion in the proceedings. Some authors have decided that it is easier to (re)learn LaTeX and use the LaTeX template on Overleaf than to fight with the Word template.  
 The template permits various forms of draft document. Please do not  use a form that overlaps a watermark with the text of the paper, as this makes the text very difficult for some people to read. In addition, if you use any form other than the expected two-column format, you will still be expected to conform with the specified page limits, as we have no clear way of estimating the properly formatted size of a submission that is not formatted as specified.  
 Submission process  
 Caution:  Submitting the paper abstract is not as simple as uploading a file and clicking ‘Submit’. The review process requires a great deal of information in order to ensure that your submission receives the best possible review, and that information is gathered at the time of first submission. Authors are advised to allow at least half an hour when first submitting the paper.  
 If submitting a full paper, think carefully about which of the three tracks it belongs in. There is no process for shifting submissions between tracks: submissions will be reviewed by the guidelines of the track to which they are submitted, and if they do not fit well in that track, they are unlikely to be favourably reviewed.  
 Before making a submission, please be ready with the email addresses of all co-authors; when making the submission, please take particular care when entering the addresses. Email addresses are required, and every invalid email address — even for a non-corresponding author — generates a bounce message sent to the ITiCSE chairs. Please take the time to avoid this.  
 To submit your work, follow the link to the EasyChair submission page:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iticse2025    
  (EasyChair will be opened in the beginning of December)   
 If you don’t already have an account, you will be prompted to create one. After logging in, you will find a submission form that requires you to enter the type, title, and abstract of your submission, plus contact information for all authors. The PDF file may be uploaded at the same time, or later. Both the information and the file may be updated at any time until the submission deadline.  
 You and all of your co-authors will receive email messages confirming the submission. Spam filters sometimes trap these automatically generated messages, so you may need to check your spam trap for confirmation and for any subsequent emails, including your notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior  to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  ( For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after  the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

 Call for Papers  

 This page provides detailed information about paper submissions to the ITiCSE 2025 conference. It is part of the general Call for Participation  which you should read first, if you have not yet done so.  
 If you have questions that neither this page nor the Call for Participation  can answer, please contact the program chairs  .  
 ITiCSE 2025 paper tracks   
 Papers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing.  
 Note that an abstract submission  is mandatory for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers.  
 When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks. Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct track. Authors are advised to look at the review guidelines  for their paper track, so as to know what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing the submission. Papers will be reviewed according to the track to which they were submitted, and it will not be moved between tracks.  
 Computing education research | : papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t; 
  Position papers and proposals | : papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right. 
   
  All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention. Initial submissions must be anonymous.  
 Submitting the abstract   
 Your abstract can be up to 250 words and must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for these dates  )  . The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field.  
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers that they are qualified to review and interested in reviewing. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that you believe will best describe the finished paper.  
 Anonymous version for review   
 Please read this section carefully to avoid the unfortunate situation of a desk rejection.  
 The paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version  so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed: this includes authors’ names; authors’ affiliations; any information in the body or the headers of the paper that might identify the authors or their institutions, such as websites, related publications, or specific geographic locations; and acknowledgements, which often include material that might identify the authors. Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know that the authors are citing themselves. For example, instead of “We reported on our first experiment in 2018 [13]”, the paper might say “An early experiment in this area was carried out in 2018 [13]”, or “Katchen and Satie [13] carried out an early experiment in this area in 2018”. If a paper is presenting software that is the work of the authors, the name of the software should be anonymised, so that it will not be found with a web search.  
 When writing the review version of the paper, space should be left for the authors’ names, affiliations, and other material that might need to be added, such as the ACM reference format  . This can be implemented either by the use of placeholders or simply by ensuring that the paper is sufficiently short of the page limit. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit.  
 Papers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason, they should not include links to additional material  , such as a demonstration of software being introduced.  
 If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, affiliations, citations, acknowledgements, and references, and that may, if appropriate, include links to supplementary information.  
 We are aware that some authors publish their papers prior to submission in places such as arXiv, with full author details. This is permitted according to ACM policy  . However, this does breach anonymity as such papers can easily be found by a reviewer looking for background on the subject matter. In view of this, we recommend submitting to arXiv or such sites with a different title and abstract than the submitted (review) version to cut down on “accidental” discoveries of papers on arXiv that would compromise anonymity.  
 Ethical status of data collection   
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.  
 Formatting the paper   
 The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references. Note that this is not the same as seven pages: if there is a seventh page, there must be nothing on it but references.  
 If the paper includes figures and tables, the text in them must be readable at 100% magnification and in greyscale. Figures and tables must be readable if the paper is printed.  
 For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, see Formatting requirements  on the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please ensure that the file to be submitted is no more than 10MB in size. When files are this size and more, it is typically because the authors have pasted in high-resolution images and simply scaled them down, rather than reducing the file size before inserting the image.  
 Important dates   
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right or at Important Dates  page  
 Submitting the paper   
 Follow the instructions on Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.  
 Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your paper because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!  
 When the paper is fully anonymous and ready for review, convert it to Adobe PDF format. Please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the properties of the PDF file.  
 Return to the online submission system using the link on the call for participation  page, select the entry for your paper, and click a link in the upper right of the page to add or update the file.  
 After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy.  
 Please note:  ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings. See our full policy  for more information.

 Call for Posters  

 This page provides detailed information about poster submissions to the ITiCSE 2025 conference. It is part of the general Call for Participation  which you should read first, if you have not yet done so.  
 If you have questions that neither this page nor the Call for Participation  can answer, please contact the poster chairs  .  
 Poster presentation   
 ITiCSE poster sessions provide an opportunity to share computing education ideas in a less formal setting than a paper presentation.  
 A poster is a single-page document, typically combining text and images, that embodies a succinct description of work that has been done. Presenting a poster is a good way to discuss and receive feedback on a work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper.  
 Posters should not re-present previously published work.  
 Poster proposal review is not anonymous.  
 ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. By SIGCSE policy, at least one author  is required to register, attend and present the poster in person. See our full policy  for more information.  
 Poster topic ideas   
 The topic of a poster presentation should lend itself to presentation in poster format, possibly with additional details available in the form of web references. You might consider a poster presentation of teaching materials that you would like to share, or preliminary research findings. Examples might include:  
 imaginative assignments 
  innovative curriculum design 
  laboratory materials 
  initiatives for recruiting and retaining students 
  computing education research that is in a preliminary stage 
  Suggestions for poster design are given in Research Posters 101  . Although these suggestions were published for student researchers, the ideas are also applicable to posters for this conference.  
 Formatting the poster proposal   
 A poster proposal is a single page, in PDF format, explaining what the poster is about. This proposal is used to review the submission and will be published with the conference proceedings if the submission is accepted. The one-page proposal must adhere to ACM’s publication guidelines.  For more detail, see Formatting requirements  on the Call for Participation page  .  
 To facilitate the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting specifications and the page limit.  
 Poster proposal contents   
 A poster proposal will typically include the following information in the ACM format.  
 Title: | a title for the poster. 
  Proposer: | include name, affiliation, and email address. Correspondence related to the conference will be sent by email. Please check your spam filter if you haven’t received an expected notification because the bulk emails generated by the conference software are sometimes blocked. 
  Abstract: | a description of the poster. The same abstract will also need to be copied into a text box on the submission page. Please be sure that your description is accurate and that both submitted copies (in the PDF poster proposal and in the submission text box) are exactly the same. 
  Content: | A description of the expected content of the poster, along with an indication of why the topic is significant: why conference attendees will find it interesting. 
  Important dates for posters   
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right.  
 Submitting a poster proposal   
 Write your submission using the format specified above.  
 Convert your poster into Adobe PDF format.  
 Follow the instructions on the Submission process  at the foot of the Call for Participation  page.

 Call for Papers  

 This page provides detailed information about paper submissions to the ITiCSE 2025 conference. It is part of the general Call for Participation  which you should read first, if you have not yet done so.  
 If you have questions that neither this page nor the Call for Participation  can answer, please contact the program chairs  .  
 ITiCSE 2025 paper tracks   
 Papers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing.  
 Note that an abstract submission  is mandatory for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers.  
 When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks. Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct track. Authors are advised to look at the review guidelines  for their paper track, so as to know what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing the submission. Papers will be reviewed according to the track to which they were submitted, and it will not be moved between tracks.  
 Computing education research | : papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
  Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t; 
  Position papers and proposals | : papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right. 
   
  All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention. Initial submissions must be anonymous.  
 Submitting the abstract   
 Your abstract can be up to 250 words and must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for these dates  )  . The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field.

 ITS is evolving to a new concept of Artificial Intelligence which can be found in various disciplines and can serve human education and well-being. This new concept is named: GENERATIVE INTELLIGENCE. Generative Intelligence concerns various AI systems, techniques, architectures, methods, or tools based on deep and machine learning which can be used to generate texts, images, solutions, and environments, able to enhance HUMAN intelligence, cognitive capacities, memory, and learning. Instead of trying to reproduce human behavior or recognize human traits using artificial intelligence techniques or learning analytics, Generative Intelligence provides means to increase human cognitive potential.   
   
 The conference is supported by the following tracks in which the concepts mentioned above contribute to the increase of intelligence. Each track includes (but is not limimted to) a list of topics of interest which can be found below. Submitted papers should refer to one of the corresponding tracks.

 Alpha-Beta Pruning Verified (Invited Talk)   
 Authors:  Tobias Nipkow  
  Abstract    
 Alpha-beta pruning is an efficient search strategy for two-player game trees. It was invented in the late 1950s and is at the heart of most implementations of combinatorial game playing programs. We have formalized and verified a number of variations of alpha-beta pruning, in particular fail-hard and fail-soft, and valuations into linear orders, distributive lattices and domains with negative values.

 Translating Libraries of Definitions and Theorems Between Proof Systems (Invited Talk)   
 Authors:  Frédéric Blanqui  
  Abstract    
 There exist many proof systems, interactive or automated. However, most of them are not interoperable, which leads to an important work duplication. This is unfortunate as it slows down the formalization of more advanced mathematical results, and the democratization of proof systems in education, industry and research. This state of affairs is not just a matter of file formats. Each proof system has its own axioms and deduction rules, and those axioms and deduction rules can sometimes be incompatible. To translate a proof from one system to the other, and be able to handle so many different systems, it is important to find out a logical framework in which a logical feature used in two different systems is represented by the same construction. Research on proof system interoperability started about 30 years ago, and received some increased attention with the formalization of Hales proof of Kepler conjecture in the years 2000, because parts of this proof were initially formalized in different systems. Then, it received some new interest in the years 2010 with the increasing use of automated theorem provers in proof assistants. At about the same time appeared a new logical framework, Dedukti, which extends Edinburgh’s logical framework LF by allowing the identification of types modulo some equational theory. It has been shown that various proof systems can be nicely encoded in Dedukti, and various tools have been developed to actually represent the proofs of those systems and translate them to other systems. In this talk, I will review some of these works and tools, and present recent efforts to translate entire libraries of definitions and theorems.

 A Formal Analysis of Capacity Scaling Algorithms for Minimum Cost Flows   
 Authors:  Mohammad Abdulaziz and Thomas Ammer  
  Abstract    
 We present a formalisation of the correctness of algorithms to solve minimum-cost flow problems, in Isabelle/HOL. Two of the algorithms are based on the technique of scaling, most notably Orlin’s algorithm, which has the fastest running time for the problem of minimum-cost flow. Our work uncovered a number of complications in the proofs of the results we formalised, the resolution of which required significant effort. Our work is also the first to formally consider the problem of minimum-cost flows and, more generally, scaling algorithms.

 Taming Differentiable Logics with Coq Formalisation   
 Authors:  Reynald Affeldt, Alessandro Bruni, Ekaterina Komendantskaya, Natalia Ślusarz, and Kathrin Stark  
  Abstract    
 For performance and verification in machine learning, new methods have recently been proposed that optimise learning systems to satisfy formally expressed logical properties. Among these methods, differentiable logics (DLs) are used to translate propositional or first-order formulae into loss functions deployed for optimisation in machine learning. At the same time, recent attempts to give programming language support for verification of neural networks showed that DLs can be used to compile verification properties to machine-learning backends. This situation is calling for stronger guarantees about the soundness of such compilers, the soundness and compositionality of DLs, and the differentiability and performance of the resulting loss functions. In this paper, we propose an approach to formalise existing DLs using the Mathematical Components library in the Coq proof assistant. Thanks to this formalisation, we are able to give uniform semantics to otherwise disparate DLs, give formal proofs to existing informal arguments, find errors in previous work, and provide formal proofs to missing conjectured properties. This work is meant as a stepping stone for the development of programming language support for verification of machine learning.

 A Comprehensive Overview of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem in Coq   
 Authors:  Reynald Affeldt and Zachary Stone  
  Abstract    
 Formalization of real analysis offers a chance to rebuild traditional proofs of important theorems as unambiguous theories that can be interactively explored. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem formalized in the Coq proof assistant, from which the first Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) for the Lebesgue integral is obtained as a corollary. Proving the first FTC in this way has the advantage of decomposing into loosely-coupled theories of moderate size and of independent interest that lend themselves well to incremental and collaborative development. We explain how we formalize all the topological constructs and all the standard lemmas needed to eventually relate the definitions of derivability and of Lebesgue integration of MathComp-Analysis, a formalization of analysis developed on top of the Mathematical Components library. In the course of this experiment, we substantially enrich MathComp-Analysis and even devise a new proof for Urysohn’s lemma.

 Towards Solid Abelian Groups: A Formal Proof of Nöbeling’s Theorem   
 Authors:  Dagur Asgeirsson  
  Abstract    
 Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, is a new way of studying the interplay between algebra and geometry. It replaces the concept of a topological space by a more sophisticated but better-behaved idea, namely that of a condensed set. Central to the theory are solid abelian groups and liquid vector spaces, analogues of complete topological groups. Nöbeling’s theorem, a surprising result from the 1960s about the structure of the abelian group of continuous maps from a profinite space to the integers, is a crucial ingredient in the theory of solid abelian groups; without it one cannot give any nonzero examples of solid abelian groups. We discuss a recently completed formalisation of this result in the Lean theorem prover, and give a more detailed proof than those previously available in the literature. The proof is somewhat unusual in that it requires induction over ordinals - a technique which has not previously been used to a great extent in formalised mathematics.

 An Operational Semantics in Isabelle/HOL-CSP   
 Authors:  Benoît Ballenghien and Burkhart Wolff  
  Abstract    
 The theory of Communicating Sequential Processes going back to Hoare and Roscoe is still today a reference model for concurrency. In the fairly rich literature, several versions of operational semantics have been discussed, which should be consistent with the denotational one. This work is based on Isabelle/HOL-CSP 2.0, a shallow embedding of the failure-divergence model of denotational semantics proposed by Hoare, Roscoe and Brookes in the eighties. In several ways, HOL-CSP is actually an extension of the original setting in the sense that it admits higher-order processes and infinite alphabets. In this paper, we present a construction and formal equivalence proofs between operational CSP semantics and the underlying denotational failure-divergence semantics. The construction is based on a definition of the operational transition operator P ⇝e P’ basically via the After operator and the classical failure-divergence refinement. Several choices are discussed to formally derive the operational semantics leading to subtle differences. The derived operational semantics for symbolic Labelled Transition Systems (LTSs) can be potentially used for certifications of model-checker logs as well as combined proof techniques.

 The Directed Van Kampen Theorem in Lean   
 Authors:  Henning Basold, Peter Bruin, and Dominique Lawson  
  Abstract    
 Directed topology augments the concept of a topological space with a notion of directed paths. This leads to a category of directed spaces, in which the morphisms are continuous maps respecting directed paths. Directed topology thereby enables an accurate representation of computation paths in concurrent systems that usually cannot be reversed. Even though ideas from algebraic topology have analogues in directed topology, the directedness drastically changes how spaces can be characterised. For instance, while an important homotopy invariant of a topological space is its fundamental groupoid, for directed spaces this has to be replaced by the fundamental category because directed paths are not necessarily reversible. In this paper, we present a Lean 4 formalisation of directed spaces and of a Van Kampen theorem for them, which allows the fundamental category of a directed space to be computed in terms of the fundamental categories of subspaces. Part of this formalisation is also a significant theory of directed spaces, directed homotopy theory and path coverings, which can serve as basis for future formalisations of directed topology. The formalisation in Lean can also be used in computer-assisted reasoning about the behaviour of concurrent systems that have been represented as directed spaces.

 Authors:  Siddharth Bhat, Alex Keizer, Chris Hughes, Andrés Goens, and Tobias Grosser  
  Abstract    
 There is an increasing need for domain-specific reasoning in modern compilers. This has fueled the use of tailored intermediate representations (IRs) based on static single assignment (SSA), like in the MLIR compiler framework. Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) provide strong guarantees for the end-to-end verification of compilers (e.g., CompCert). However, modern compilers and their IRs evolve at a rate that makes proof engineering alongside them prohibitively expensive. Nevertheless, well-scoped push-button automated verification tools such as the Alive peephole verifier for LLVM-IR gained recognition in domains where SMT solvers offer efficient (semi) decision procedures. In this paper, we aim to combine the convenience of automation with the versatility of ITPs for verifying peephole rewrites across domain-specific IRs. We formalize a core calculus for SSA-based IRs that is generic over the IR and covers so-called regions (nested scoping used by many domain-specific IRs in the MLIR ecosystem). Our mechanization in the Lean proof assistant provides a user-friendly frontend for translating MLIR syntax into our calculus. We provide scaffolding for defining and verifying peephole rewrites, offering tactics to eliminate the abstraction overhead of our SSA calculus. We prove correctness theorems about peephole rewriting, as well as two classical program transformations. To evaluate our framework, we consider three use cases from the MLIR ecosystem that cover different levels of abstractions: (1) bitvector rewrites from LLVM, (2) structured control flow, and (3) fully homomorphic encryption. We envision that our mechanization provides a foundation for formally verified rewrites on new domain-specific IRs.

 Duper: A Proof-Producing Superposition Theorem Prover for Dependent Type Theory   
 Authors:  Joshua Clune, Yicheng Qian, Alexander Bentkamp, and Jeremy Avigad  
  Abstract    
 We present Duper, a proof-producing theorem prover for Lean based on the superposition calculus. Duper can be called directly as a terminal tactic in interactive Lean proofs, but is also designed with proof reconstruction for a future Lean hammer in mind. In this paper, we describe Duper’s underlying approach to proof search and proof reconstruction with a particular emphasis on the challenges of working in a dependent type theory. We also compare Duper’s performance to Metis' on pre-existing benchmarks to give evidence that Duper is performant enough to be useful for proof reconstruction in a hammer.

 A Formalization of the General Theory of Quaternions   
 Authors:  Thaynara Arielly de Lima, André Luiz Galdino, Bruno Berto de Oliveira Ribeiro, and Mauricio Ayala-Rincón  
  Abstract    
 This paper discusses the formalization of the theory of quaternions in the Prototype Verification System (PVS). The general approach in this mechanization relies on specifying quaternion structures using any arbitrary field as a parameter. The approach allows the inheritance of formalized properties on quaternions when the parameters of the general theory are instantiated with specific fields such as reals or rationals. The theory includes characterizing algebraic properties that lead to constructing quaternions as division rings. In particular, we illustrate how the general theory is applied to formalize Hamilton’s quaternions using the field of reals as a parameter, for which we also mechanized theorems that show the completeness of three-dimensional rotations, proving that Hamilton’s quaternions mimic any 3D rotation.

 A Modular Formalization of Superposition in Isabelle/HOL   
 Authors:  Martin Desharnais, Balazs Toth, Uwe Waldmann, Jasmin Blanchette, and Sophie Tourret  
  Abstract    
 Superposition is an efficient proof calculus for reasoning about first-order logic with equality that is implemented in many automatic theorem provers. It works by saturating the given set of clauses and is refutationally complete, meaning that if the set is inconsistent, the saturation will contain a contradiction. In this work, we restructured the completeness proof to cleanly separate the ground (i.e., variable-free) and nonground aspects, and we formalized the result in Isabelle/HOL. We relied on the IsaFoR library for first-order terms and on the Isabelle saturation framework.

 Completeness of Asynchronous Session Tree Subtyping in Coq   
 Authors:  Burak Ekici and Nobuko Yoshida  
  Abstract    
 Multiparty session types (MPST) serve as a foundational framework for formally specifying and verifying message passing protocols. Asynchronous subtyping in MPST allows for typing optimised programs preserving type safety and deadlock freedom under asynchronous interactions where the message order is preserved and sending is non-blocking. The optimisation is obtained by message reordering, which allows for sending messages earlier or receiving them later. Sound subtyping algorithms have been extensively studied and implemented as part of various programming languages and tools including C, Rust and C-MPI. However, formalising all such permutations under sequencing, selection, branching and recursion in session types is an intricate task. Additionally, checking asynchronous subtyping has been proven to be undecidable. This paper introduces the first formalisation of asynchronous subtyping in MPST within the Coq proof assistant. We first decompose session types into session trees that do not involve branching and selection, and then establish a coinductive refinement relation over them to govern subtyping. To showcase our formalisation, we prove example subtyping schemas that appear in the literature, all of which cannot be verified, at the same time, by any of the existing decidable sound algorithms. Additionally, we take the (inductive) negation of the refinement relation from a prior work by Ghilezan et al. [Ghilezan et al., 2023] and re-implement it, significantly reducing the number of rules (from eighteen to eight). We establish the completeness of subtyping with respect to its negation in Coq, addressing the issues concerning the negation rules outlined in the previous work [Ghilezan et al., 2023]. In the formalisation, we use the greatest fixed point of the least fixed point technique, facilitated by the paco library, to define coinductive predicates. We employ parametrised coinduction to prove their properties. The formalisation consists of roughly 10K lines of Coq code, accessible at: https://github.com/ekiciburak/sessionTreeST/tree/itp2024.

 End-To-End Formal Verification of a Fast and Accurate Floating-Point Approximation   
 Authors:  Florian Faissole, Paul Geneau de Lamarlière, and Guillaume Melquiond  
  Abstract    
 Designing an efficient yet accurate floating-point approximation of a mathematical function is an intricate and error-prone process. This warrants the use of formal methods, especially formal proof, to achieve some degree of confidence in the implementation. Unfortunately, the lack of automation or its poor interplay with the more manual parts of the proof makes it way too costly in practice. This article revisits the issue by proposing a methodology and some dedicated automation, and applies them to the use case of a faithful binary64 approximation of exponential. The peculiarity of this use case is that the target of the formal verification is not a simple modeling of an external code; it is an actual floating-point function defined in the logic of the Coq proof assistant, which is thus usable inside proofs once its correctness has been fully verified. This function presents all the attributes of a state-of-the-art implementation: bit-level manipulations, large tables of constants, obscure floating-point transformations, exceptional values, etc. This function has been integrated into the proof strategies of the CoqInterval library, bringing a 20× speedup with respect to the previous implementation.

 Typed Compositional Quantum Computation with Lenses   
 Authors:  Jacques Garrigue and Takafumi Saikawa  
  Abstract    
 We propose a type-theoretic framework for describing and proving properties of quantum computations, in particular those presented as quantum circuits. Our proposal is based on an observation that, in the polymorphic type system of Coq, currying on quantum states allows one to apply quantum gates directly inside a complex circuit. By introducing a discrete notion of lens to control this currying, we are further able to separate the combinatorics of the circuit structure from the computational content of gates. We apply our development to define quantum circuits recursively from the bottom up, and prove their correctness compositionally.

 A Formal Proof of R(4,5)=25   
 Authors:  Thibault Gauthier and Chad E. Brown  
  Abstract    
 In 1995, McKay and Radziszowski proved that the Ramsey number R(4,5) is equal to 25. Their proof relies on a combination of high-level arguments and computational steps. The authors have performed the computational parts of the proof with different implementations in order to reduce the possibility of an error in their programs. In this work, we prove this theorem in the interactive theorem prover HOL4 limiting the uncertainty to the small HOL4 kernel. Instead of verifying their algorithms directly, we rely on the HOL4 interface to MiniSat to prove gluing lemmas. To reduce the number of such lemmas and thus make the computational part of the proof feasible, we implement a generalization algorithm. We verify that its output covers all the possible cases by implementing a custom SAT-solver extended with a graph isomorphism checker.

 Verifying Software Emulation of an Unsupported Hardware Instruction   
 Authors:  Samuel Gruetter, Thomas Bourgeat, and Adam Chlipala  
  Abstract    
 Some processors, especially embedded ones, do not implement all instructions in hardware. Instead, if the processor encounters an unimplemented instruction, an unsupported-instruction exception is raised, and an exception handler is run that implements the missing instruction in software. Getting such a system to work correctly is tricky: The exception-handler code must not destroy any state of the user program and must use the control and status registers (CSRs) of the processor correctly. Moreover, parts of the handler are typically implemented in assembly, while other parts are implemented in a language like C, and one must make sure that when jumping from the user program into the handler assembly, from the handler assembly into C, back to assembly and finally back to the user program, all the assumptions made by the different pieces of code, hardware, and the compiler are satisfied. Despite all these tricky details, there is a concise and intuitive way of stating the correctness of such a system: User programs running on a system where some instructions are implemented in software behave the same as if they were running on a system where all instructions are implemented in hardware. We formalize and prove such a statement in the Coq proof assistant, for the case of a simple exception handler implementing the multiplication instruction on a RISC-V processor.

 Mechanized HOL Reasoning in Set Theory   
 Authors:  Simon Guilloud, Sankalp Gambhir, Andrea Gilot, and Viktor Kunčak  
  Abstract    
 We present a mechanized embedding of higher-order logic (HOL) and algebraic data types (ADTs) into first-order logic with ZFC axioms. Our approach interprets types as sets, with function (arrow) types coinciding with set-theoretic function spaces. We assume traditional FOL syntax without notation for term-level binders. To embed λ-terms, we define a notion of context, defining the closure of all abstractions occuring inside a term. We implement the embedding in the Lisa proof assistant for schematic first-order logic and its library based on axiomatic set theory (presented at ITP 2023). We show how to implement type checking and the proof steps of HOL Light as proof-producing tactics in Lisa. The embedded HOL theorems and proofs are interoperable with the existing Lisa library. This yields a form of soft type system supporting top-level polymorphism and ADTs within set theory. The approach offers tools for Lisa users to carry HOL-style proofs within set theory. It also enables the import of HOL Light theorem statements into Lisa, as well as the replay of small HOL Light kernel proofs.

 Modular Verification of Intrusive List and Tree Data Structures in Separation Logic   
 Authors:  Marc Hermes and Robbert Krebbers  
  Abstract    
 Intrusive linked data structures are commonly used in low-level programming languages such as C for efficiency and to enable a form of generic types. Notably, intrusive versions of linked lists and search trees are used in the Linux kernel and the Boost C++ library. These data structures differ from ordinary data structures in the way that nodes contain only the meta data (i.e. pointers to other nodes), but not the data itself. Instead the programmer needs to embed nodes into the data, thereby avoiding pointer indirections, and allowing data to be part of several data structures. In this paper we address the challenge of specifying and verifying intrusive data structures using separation logic. We aim for modular verification, where we first specify and verify the operations on the nodes (without the data) and then use these specifications to verify clients that attach data. We achieve this by employing a representation predicate that separates the data structure’s node structure from the data that is attached to it. We apply our methodology to singly-linked lists - from which we build cyclic and doubly-linked lists - and binary trees - from which we build binary search trees. All verifications are conducted using the Coq proof assistant, making use of the Iris framework for separation logic.

 Formalizing the Algebraic Small Object Argument in UniMath   
 Authors:  Dennis Hilhorst and Paige Randall North  
  Abstract    
 Quillen model category theory forms the cornerstone of modern homotopy theory, and thus the semantics of (and justification for the name of) homotopy type theory / univalent foundations (HoTT/UF). One of the main tools of Quillen model category theory is the small object argument. Indeed, the particular model categories that can interpret HoTT/UF are usually constructed using the small object argument. In this article, we formalize the algebraic small object argument, a modern categorical version of the small object argument originally due to Garner, in the Coq UniMath library. This constitutes a first step in building up the tools required to formalize - in a system based on HoTT/UF - the semantics of HoTT/UF in particular model categories: for instance, Voevodsky’s original interpretation into simplicial sets. More specifically, in this work, we rephrase and formalize Garner’s original formulation of the algebraic small object argument. We fill in details of Garner’s construction and redefine parts of the construction to be more direct and fit for formalization. We rephrase the theory in more modern language, using constructions like displayed categories and a modern, less strict notion of monoidal categories. We point out the interaction between the theory and the foundations, and motivate the use of the algebraic small object argument in lieu of Quillen’s original small object argument from a constructivist standpoint.

 A Formalization of the Lévy-Prokhorov Metric in Isabelle/HOL   
 Authors:  Michikazu Hirata  
  Abstract    
 The Lévy-Prokhorov metric is a metric between finite measures on a metric space. The metric was introduced to analyze weak convergence of measures. We formalize the Lévy-Prokhorov metric and prove Prokhorov’s theorem in Isabelle/HOL. Prokhorov’s theorem provides a condition for the relative compactness of sets of finite measures and plays essential roles in proofs of the central limit theorem, Sanov’s theorem in large deviation theory, and the existence of optimal coupling in transportation theory. Our formalization includes important results in mathematics such as the Riesz representation theorem, which is a theorem in functional analysis and used to prove Prokhorov’s theorem. We also apply the Lévy-Prokhorov metric to show that the measurable space of finite measures on a standard Borel space is again a standard Borel space.

 Distributed Parallel Build for the Isabelle Archive of Formal Proofs   
 Authors:  Fabian Huch and Makarius Wenzel  
  Abstract    
 Motivated by the continuously growing performance demands for the Isabelle Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP), we introduce distributed cluster computing to the Isabelle platform. Parallel build time on a single node has approached 4h-8h in recent years: by supporting multiple nodes, without shared memory nor shared file-systems, we target at a substantial speedup factor to get below the critical limit of 45min total elapsed time. Our distributed build tool is part of the regular Isabelle distribution, but specifically adapted to cope with the structure of projects seen in the AFP. In this work, we address two main challenges: (1) the distributed system architecture that has been implemented in Isabelle/Scala, and (2) the build schedule optimization problem for multi-threaded tasks on multiple compute nodes. We introduce a heuristic tuned to the typical AFP session structure, which can generate good schedules in a few seconds. We reached a total speedup factor of over 100, which is a milestone never before reached. Using this approach, we could build the Isabelle distribution in 8min 10s elapsed time, and the AFP in 35min 40s, or 1h 59min 13s including very slow sessions.

 A Generalised Union of Rely-Guarantee and Separation Logic Using Permission Algebras   
 Authors:  Vincent Jackson, Toby Murray, and Christine Rizkallah  
  Abstract    
 This paper describes GenRGSep, an Isabelle/HOL library for the development of RGSep logics using a general algebraic state model. In particular, we develop an algebraic state models based on resource algebras that assume neither the presence of unit resources or the cancellativity law. If a new resource model is required, its components need only be proven an instance of a permission algebra, and then they can be composed together using tuples and functions. The proof of soundness is performed by Vafeiadis' operational soundness method. This method was originally formulated with respect to a concrete heap model. This paper adapts it to account for the absence of both units as well as the cancellativity law.

 An Isabelle/HOL Formalization of Narrowing and Multiset Narrowing for E-Unifiability, Reachability and Infeasibility   
 Authors:  Dohan Kim  
  Abstract    
 We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization of narrowing for E-unifiability, reachability, and infeasibility. Given a semi-complete rewrite system ℛ and two terms s and t, we show a formalized proof that if narrowing terminates, then it provides a decision procedure for ℛ-unifiability for s and t, where ℛ is viewed as a set of equations. Furthermore, we present multiset narrowing and its formalization for multiset reachability and reachability analysis, providing decision procedures using certain restricted conditions on multiset reachability and reachability problems. Our multiset narrowing also provides a complete method for E-unifiability problems consisting of multiple goals if E can be represented by a complete rewrite system.

 Formalizing the Cholesky Factorization Theorem   
 Authors:  Carl Kwan and Warren A. Hunt Jr.  
  Abstract    
 We present a formal proof of the Cholesky Factorization Theorem, a fundamental result in numerical linear algebra, by verifying formally a Cholesky decomposition algorithm in ACL2. Our mechanical proof of correctness is largely automatic for two main reasons: (1) we employ a derivation which involves partitioning the matrix to obtain the desired result; and (2) we provide an inductive invariant for the Cholesky decomposition algorithm. To formalize (1), we build support for reasoning about partitioned matrices. This is a departure from how typical numerical linear algebra algorithms are presented, i.e. via excessive indexing. To enable (2), we build a new recursive recognizer for a matrix to be Cholesky decomposable and mathematically prove that the recognizer is indeed necessary and sufficient. Guided by the recognizer, ACL2 automatically inducts and verifies the Cholesky decomposition algorithm. We also present our ACL2-based formalization of the decomposition algorithm itself, and discuss how to bridge the gap between verifying a decomposition algorithm and proving the Cholesky Factorization Theorem. To our knowledge, this is the first formalization of the Cholesky Factorization Theorem.

 The Rewster: Type Preserving Rewrite Rules for the Coq Proof Assistant   
 Authors:  Yann Leray, Gaëtan Gilbert, Nicolas Tabareau, and Théo Winterhalter  
  Abstract    
 In dependently typed proof assistants, users can declare axioms to extend the ambient logic locally with new principles and propositional equalities governing them. Additionally, rewrite rules have recently been proposed to allow users to extend the logic with new definitional equalities, enabling them to handle new principles with a computational behaviour. While axioms can only break consistency, the addition of arbitrary rewrite rules can break other important metatheoretical properties such as type preservation. In this paper, we present an implementation of rewrite rules on top of the Coq proof assistant, together with a modular criterion to ensure that the added rewrite rules preserve typing. This criterion, based on bidirectional type checking, is formally expressed in PCUIC - the type theory of Coq recently developed in the MetaCoq project.

 Teaching Mathematics Using Lean and Controlled Natural Language   
 Authors:  Patrick Massot  
  Abstract    
 We present Verbose Lean, a library using the flexibility of the Lean programming language and proof assistant to teach undergrad mathematics students how to read and write traditional paper proofs. After explaining our main pedagogical goals, we explain how students use the library with varying levels of assistance to write proofs that are easy to transfer to paper because they look like natural language. We then describe how teachers can customize the student experience based on their specific pedagogical goals and constraints. Finally we describe some aspects of the implementation of the library, emphasizing how new aspects of the very recently released version 4 of Lean allow a lot of flexibility that could benefit many new creative uses of a proof assistant.

 Lean Formalization of Completeness Proof for Coalition Logic with Common Knowledge   
 Authors:  Kai Obendrauf, Anne Baanen, Patrick Koopmann, and Vera Stebletsova  
  Abstract    
 Coalition Logic (CL) is a well-known formalism for reasoning about the strategic abilities of groups of agents in multi-agent systems. Coalition Logic with Common Knowledge (CLC) extends CL with operators from epistic logics, and thus with the ability to model the individual and common knowledge of agents. We have formalized the syntax and semantics of both logics in the interactive theorem prover Lean 4, and used it to prove soundness and completeness of its axiomatization. Our formalization uses the type class system to generalize over different aspects of CLC, thus allowing us to reuse some of to prove properties in related logics such as CL and CLK (CL with individual knowledge).

 Conway Normal Form: Bridging Approaches for Comprehensive Formalization of Surreal Numbers   
 Authors:  Karol Pąk and Cezary Kaliszyk  
  Abstract    
 The proper class of Conway’s surreal numbers forms a rich totally ordered algebraically closed field with many arithmetic and algebraic properties close to those of real numbers, the ordinals, and infinitesimal numbers. In this paper, we formalize the construction of Conway’s numbers in Mizar using two approaches and propose a bridge between them, aiming to combine their advantages for efficient formalization. By replacing transfinite induction-recursion with transfinite induction, we streamline their construction. Additionally, we introduce a method to merge proofs from both approaches using global choice, facilitating formal proof. We demonstrate that surreal numbers form a field, including the square root, and that they encompass subsets such as reals, ordinals, and powers of ω. We combined Conway’s work with Ehrlich’s generalization to formally prove Conway’s Normal Form, paving the way for many formal developments in surreal number theory.

 A Coq Formalization of Taylor Models and Power Series for Solving Ordinary Differential Equations   
 Authors:  Sewon Park and Holger Thies  
  Abstract    
 In exact real computation real numbers are manipulated exactly without round-off errors, making it well-suited for high precision verified computation. In recent work we propose an axiomatic formalization of exact real computation in the Coq theorem prover. The formalization admits an extended extraction mechanism that lets us extract computational content from constructive parts of proofs to efficient programs built on top of AERN, a Haskell library for exact real computation. Many processes in science and engineering are modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and often safety-critical applications depend on computing their solutions correctly. The primary goal of the current work is to extend our framework to spaces of functions and to support computation of solutions to ODEs and other essential operators. In numerical mathematics, the most common way to represent continuous functions is to use polynomial approximations. This can be modeled by so-called Taylor models, that encode a function as a polynomial and a rigorous error-bound over some domain. We define types of classical functions that do not hold any computational content and formalize Taylor models to computationally approximate those classical functions. Classical functions are defined in a way to admit classical principles in their constructions and verification. We define various basic operations on Taylor models and verify their correctness based on the classical functions that they approximate. We then shift our interest to analytic functions as a generalization of Taylor models where polynomials are replaced by infinite power series. We use the formalization to develop a theory of non-linear polynomial ODEs. From the proofs we can extract certified exact real computation programs that compute solutions of ODEs on some time interval up to any precision.

 A Verified Earley Parser   
 Authors:  Martin Rau and Tobias Nipkow  
  Abstract    
 An Earley parser is a top-down parsing technique that is capable of parsing arbitrary context-free grammars. We present a functional implementation of an Earley parser verified using the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. Our formalization builds upon Cliff Jones' extensive, refinement-based paper proof. We implement and prove soundness and completeness of a functional recognizer modeling Jay Earley’s original imperative implementation and extend it with the necessary data structures to enable the construction of parse trees following the work of Elizabeth Scott. Building upon this foundation, we develop a functional parser and prove its soundness. We round off the paper by providing an informal argument and empirical data regarding the running time and space complexity of our implementation.

 Abstractions for Multi-Sorted Substitutions   
 Authors:  Hannes Saffrich  
  Abstract    
 Formalizing a typed programming language in a proof assistant requires to choose representations for variables and typing. Variables are often represented as de Bruijn indices, where substitution is usually defined in terms of renamings to allow for proofs by structural induction. Typing can be represented extrinsically by defining untyped terms and a typing relation, or intrinsically by combining syntax and typing into a single definition of well-typed terms. For extrinsic typing, there is again a choice between extrinsic scoping, where terms and the notion of free variables are defined separately, and intrinsic scoping, where terms are indexed by their free variables. This paper describes an Agda framework for formalizing programming languages with extrinsic typing, intrinsic scoping, and de Bruijn Indices for variables. The framework supports object languages with arbitrary many variable sorts and dependencies, making it suitable for polymorphic languages and dependent types. Given an Agda definition of syntax and typing, the framework derives substitution operations and lemmas for untyped terms, and provides an abstraction to prove type preservation of these operations with just a single lemma. The key insights behind the framework are the use of multi-sorted syntax definitions, which enable parallel substitutions that replace all variables of all sorts simultaneously, and abstractions that unify the definitions, compositions, typings, and type preservation lemmas of multi-sorted renamings and substitutions. Case studies have been conducted to prove subject reduction for System F with subtyping, dependently typed lambda calculus, and lambda calculus with pattern matching.

 Correctly Compiling Proofs About Programs Without Proving Compilers Correct   
 Authors:  Audrey Seo, Christopher Lam, Dan Grossman, and Talia Ringer  
  Abstract    
 Guaranteeing correct compilation is nearly synonymous with compiler verification. However, the correctness guarantees for certified compilers and translation validation can be stronger than we need. While many compilers do have incorrect behavior, even when a compiler bug occurs it may not change the program’s behavior meaningfully with respect to its specification. Many real-world specifications are necessarily partial in that they do not completely specify all of a program’s behavior. While compiler verification and formal methods have had great success for safety-critical systems, there are magnitudes more code, such as math libraries, compiled with incorrect compilers, that would benefit from a guarantee of its partial specification. This paper explores a technique to get guarantees about compiled programs even in the presence of an unverified, or even incorrect, compiler. Our workflow compiles programs, specifications, and proof objects, from an embedded source language and logic to an embedded target language and logic. We implement two simple imperative languages, each with its own Hoare-style program logic, and a system for instantiating proof compilers out of compilers between these two languages that fulfill certain equational conditions in Coq. We instantiate our system on four compilers: one that is incomplete, two that are incorrect, and one that is correct but unverified. We use these instances to compile Hoare proofs for several programs, and we are able to leverage compiled proofs to assist in proofs of larger programs. Our proof compiler system is formally proven sound in Coq. We demonstrate how our approach enables strong target program guarantees even in the presence of incorrect compilation, opening up new options for which proof burdens one might shoulder instead of, or in addition to, compiler correctness.

 Redex2Coq: Towards a Theory of Decidability of Redex’s Reduction Semantics   
 Authors:  Mallku Soldevila, Rodrigo Ribeiro, and Beta Ziliani  
  Abstract    
 We propose the first step in the development of a tool to automate the translation of Redex models into a semantically equivalent model in Coq, and to provide tactics to help in the certification of fundamental properties of such models. The work is based on a model of Redex’s semantics developed by Klein et al. In this iteration, we were able to code in Coq a primitive recursive definition of the matching algorithm of Redex, and prove its correctness with respect to the original specification. The main challenge was to find the right generalization of the original algorithm (and its specification), and to find the proper well-founded relation to prove its termination. Additionally, we also adequate some parts of our mechanization to prepare it for the future inclusion of Redex features absent in Klein et al., such as the Kleene’s closure operator.

 Formal Verification of the Empty Hexagon Number   
 Authors:  Bernardo Subercaseaux, Wojciech Nawrocki, James Gallicchio, Cayden Codel, Mario Carneiro, and Marijn J. H. Heule  
  Abstract    
 A recent breakthrough in computer-assisted mathematics showed that every set of 30 points in the plane in general position (i.e., no three points on a common line) contains an empty convex hexagon. Heule and Scheucher solved this problem with a combination of geometric insights and automated reasoning techniques by constructing CNF formulas ϕ_n, with O(n⁴) clauses, such that if ϕ_n is unsatisfiable then every set of n points in general position must contain an empty convex hexagon. An unsatisfiability proof for n = 30 was then found with a SAT solver using 17 300 CPU hours of parallel computation. In this paper, we formalize and verify this result in the Lean theorem prover. Our formalization covers ideas in discrete computational geometry and SAT encoding techniques by introducing a framework that connects geometric objects to propositional assignments. We see this as a key step towards the formal verification of other SAT-based results in geometry, since the abstractions we use have been successfully applied to similar problems. Overall, we hope that our work sets a new standard for the verification of geometry problems relying on extensive computation, and that it increases the trust the mathematical community places in computer-assisted proofs.

 Defining and Preserving More C Behaviors: Verified Compilation Using a Concrete Memory Model   
 Authors:  Andrew Tolmach, Chris Chhak, and Sean Anderson  
  Abstract    
 We propose a concrete ("pointer as integer") memory semantics for C that supports verified compilation to a target environment having simple "public vs. private" data protection based on tagging or sandboxing (such as the WebAssembly virtual machine). Our semantics gives definition to a range of legacy programming idioms that cause undefined behavior in standard C, and are not covered by existing verified compilers, but that often work in practice. Compiler correctness in this context implies that target programs are secure against all control-flow attacks (although not against data-only attacks). To avoid tying our semantics too closely to particular compiler implementation choices, it is parameterized by a novel form of oracle that non-deterministically chooses the addresses of stack and heap allocations. As a proof-of-concept, we formalize a small RTL-like language and verify two-way refinement for a compiler from this language to a low-level machine and runtime system with hardware tagging. Our Coq formalization and proofs are provided as supplementary material.

 Integrals Within Integrals: A Formalization of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev Inequality   
 Authors:  Floris van Doorn and Heather Macbeth  
  Abstract    
 We introduce an abstraction which allows arguments involving iterated integrals to be formalized conveniently in type-theory-based proof assistants. We call this abstraction the marginal construction, since it is connected to the marginal distribution in probability theory. The marginal construction gracefully handles permutations to the order of integration (Tonelli’s theorem in several variables), as well as arguments involving an induction over dimension. We implement the marginal construction and several applications in the language Lean. The most difficult of these applications, the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality, is a foundational result in the theory of elliptic partial differential equations and has not previously been formalized.

 The Functor of Points Approach to Schemes in Cubical Agda   
 Authors:  Max Zeuner and Matthias Hutzler  
  Abstract    
 We present a formalization of quasi-compact and quasi-separated schemes (qcqs-schemes) in the Cubical Agda proof assistant. We follow Grothendieck’s functor of points approach, which defines schemes, the quintessential notion of modern algebraic geometry, as certain well-behaved functors from commutative rings to sets. This approach is often regarded as conceptually simpler than the standard approach of defining schemes as locally ringed spaces, but to our knowledge it has not yet been adopted in formalizations of algebraic geometry. We build upon a previous formalization of the so-called Zariski lattice associated to a commutative ring in order to define the notion of compact open subfunctor. This allows for a concise definition of qcqs-schemes, streamlining the usual presentation as e.g. given in the standard textbook of Demazure and Gabriel. It also lets us obtain a fully constructive proof that compact open subfunctors of affine schemes are qcqs-schemes.

 Robust Mean Estimation by All Means (Short Paper)   
 Authors:  Reynald Affeldt, Clark Barrett, Alessandro Bruni, Ieva Daukantas, Harun Khan, Takafumi Saikawa, and Carsten Schürmann  
  Abstract    
 We report the results of a verification experiment on an algorithm for robust mean estimation, i.e., an algorithm that computes a mean in the presence of outliers. We formalize the algorithm in the Coq proof assistant and devise a pragmatic approach for identifying and solving issues related to the choice of bounds. To keep our formalization succinct and generic, we recast the original argument using an existing library for finite probabilities that we extend with reusable lemmas. To formalize the original algorithm, which relies on a subtle convergence argument, we observe that by adding suitable termination checks, we can turn it into a well-founded recursion without losing its original properties. We also exploit a tactic for solving real-valued inequalities by approximation to heuristically fix inaccurate constant values in the original proof.

 Formalising Half of a Graduate Textbook on Number Theory (Short Paper)   
 Authors:  Manuel Eberl, Anthony Bordg, Lawrence C. Paulson, and Wenda Li  
  Abstract    
 Apostol’s Modular Functions and Dirichlet Series in Number Theory [Tom M. Apostol, 1990] is a graduate text covering topics such as elliptic functions, modular functions, approximation theorems and general Dirichlet series. It relies on complex analysis, winding numbers, the Riemann ζ function and Laurent series. We have formalised several chapters and can comment on the sort of gaps found in pedagogical mathematics. Proofs are available from https://github.com/Wenda302/Number_Theory_ITP2024.

 Graphical Rewriting for Diagrammatic Reasoning in Monoidal Categories in Lean4 (Short Paper)   
 Authors:  Sam Ezeh  
  Abstract    
 We present Untangle, a Lean4 extension for Visual Studio Code that displays string diagrams for morphisms inside monoidal categories, allowing users to rewrite expressions by clicking on natural transformations and morphisms in the string diagram. When the the user manipulates the string diagram by clicking on natural transformations in the Graphical User Interface, it attempts to generate relevant tactics to apply which it then inserts into the editor, allowing the user to prove equalities visually by diagram rewriting.

      ITS CONFERENCES   
 The Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) conference attracts researchers and academics, the industry and the end-users since 1988. It started out as an enthusiastic project by Professor Claude Frasson  and in 2018 celebrates its 30th anniversary at its birthplace in Montreal.  

 The ITS conference series enables, supports and enhances human learning, through an interdisciplinary research approach on Intelligent Systems. By linking together the study of the use of advanced computer technologies and various other themes, such as education, tutoring and etc, the ITS conference series builds the foundation for the evaluation of the use of Intelligent Systems in education, modeling innovative applications of technologies and the adaptation of systems to specific groups of learners.  
 The proceedings of the conferences are published with Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science  .

     About IISA 2025  

 Welcome to the official website of the 2025 International Conference on Intelligent, Interactive Systems and Applications (IISA2025). IISA2025, which can acquire knowledge and skills gradually in real environment, is based on interaction among human, environment and other agents. Further, it can deal with the present uncertainties and ambiguity in real life environment, especially in everyday situations. The design of Intelligent and Interactive Technology was difficult in the past. It required intelligent systems as well as interactions with the users through intelligent sensors and actuators so that it was not mature enough to design such technology. But today it is one of the research domains which is active and will remain open for next one decade. The areas of applications of the technology are Intelligent Robotics, Interactive Communication Technologies and Big Data as well as artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing and web intelligence.   
   
 Current research work being carried out in this domain is modeling and simulation of user-friendly systems with intelligence, development of interactive systems for people with disabilities, intelligent recommender systems, intelligent tutoring systems, interactive TV, and intelligent web-stores as well as Multi-agent Systems. It further involves the study of various issues and limitations of Intelligent and Interactive technology such as interoperability, flexibility and platform independence, etc.

 IUI 2025  
 The ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI) 2025 is the 30th annual premiere venue where researchers and practitioners meet and discuss state-of-the-art advances at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Ideal IUI submissions should address practical HCI challenges using machine intelligence and discuss both computational and human-centric aspects of such methodologies, techniques and systems.   
 The theme for IUI 2025 is Sustainability  , covering a wide variety of topics such as intelligent user interfaces accounting social inclusion, interactive intelligent systems for environmental sustainability, human control of energy management or resource conservation, behavioural change, and data-driven decision making for environmental monitoring. While we encourage submissions related to this theme, the scope of the conference is not limited to the theme only.  
 In person conference   
  IUI 2025 is intended to be an in-person conference. There will be no separate virtual attendance registration option; all registrations are for in-person attendance. In exceptional circumstances (such as visa denial), a pre-recorded video presentation will be allowed, however the registration fee must still be paid.

 In conjunction with the 30th International ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI 2025)  
 Cagliari, Italy  
 March 24-27, 2025 https://iui.acm.org/2025/   
 Call for Proposals  
 We are pleased to invite proposals for workshops and tutorials to be held in conjunction with the conference.  
 The goal of the workshops is to provide a venue for presenting research on focused topics of interest and an informal forum to discuss research questions and challenges. Potential workshop topics should be related to the general theme of the conference.  
 Tutorials are designed to provide fundamental knowledge and experience on topics related to intelligent user interfaces, and the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
 Note: We encourage you to contact the chairs with your ideas ( workshops2025@iui.acm.org  ), and work together to prepare an exciting proposal.  
 We encourage proposals for a wide range of workshop and tutorial formats and activities including but not limited to:  
 "Mini-conferences" on specialized topics | ; such workshops may have their own paper submission and review processes. 
  Interactive formats | to explore a certain topic during the workshop (e.g., through breakoutrooms); such workshops may have their own paper submission and review process or target a report summarizing the outcome of the interactive discussions. 
  "Late breaking work" | meetings; such workshops usually have a lighter review process (e.g.based on abstracts only). 
  "Hands-on" workshops | around a specific problem or topic that may wish to ask participants to submit a position statement. 
  "Project centric" workshops | that may be closely related to the scope of an existing large-scale (e.g. NSF, EU, etc. funded) project. 
  "Mini-competitions", challenges, or hackathons | around selected topics with individual or team participation. 
  Tutorials | on a specific topic relevant to IUI; for example, methods and approaches in HCI and AI, specific techniques or algorithms to develop intelligent user interfaces, etc. 
  We invite submissions of proposals for full-day and half-day workshops or tutorials. Proposals will be reviewed and evaluated by the workshop and tutorial chairs.  
 Workshops with few submissions may be cancelled, shortened, merged with other workshops, or otherwise restructured. The organizers of accepted workshops and tutorials are responsible for producing a call for participation and publicizing it, such as distributing the call to relevant newsgroups and electronic mailing lists, and especially to potential audiences from outside the IUI conference community. Workshop and tutorial organizers will maintain their own website with information about the workshop or tutorial and the ACM IUI 2025 website will refer to this website. The workshop organizers will coordinate the paper solicitation, collection, and review process. Workshops’ and tutorials’ summary will be included in the ACM Digital Library for ACM IUI 2025, and we will separately publish a joint workshop proceedings for accepted workshop submissions (through CEUR or similar).  
 Proposal Format  
 Workshop or tutorial proposals should be a maximum of four pages long (single-column format). Prepare your submission using the latest templates: Word Submission Template  , or the LaTeX template  .  
 Please submit your workshop and tutorial at https://new.precisionconference.com/~sigchi  under the IUI 2025 Workshops and Tutorials track. In PCS 2.0, first click "Submissions" at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select "SIGCHI", "IUI 2025" and "IUI 2025 Workshops and Tutorials", respectively, and press "Go".  
 The proposals should be organized as follows:  
 Name and title: | A one-word acronym and a full title. Please indicate “(Workshop)” or “(Tutorial)” after the title, as appropriate. 
  Description of workshop or tutorial topic: | This description should discuss the relevance of the suggested topic to IUI and its interest for the IUI 2025 audience. Include a brief discussion of why and for which audience the workshop or tutorial is of particular interest. 
  Previous history: | List of previous workshops or tutorials that were held on the topic including the conferences that hosted past workshops or tutorials and the number of participants. 
  Organizer(s): | Names, affiliations, emails, and web pages of the organizer(s). Provide a brief description of the background of the organizer(s). Strong proposals normally include organizers who bring differing perspectives on the topic and are actively connected to the communities of potential participants. Please indicate the primary contact person and the organizers who plan to attend the workshop. Also please provide a list of other workshops or tutorials organized by workshop organizers in the past. 
  Workshop program committee: | Names and affiliation of the members of the (tentative) workshop program committee that will evaluate the workshop submissions. 
  Participants: | A statement saying how many participants you expect and how you plan to invite participants for the workshop or tutorial. If possible, include the names of at least 10 people who have expressed interest to participate in the workshop or tutorial. 
  Workshop or Tutorial activities: | A brief description of the format regarding the mix of events or activities, such as paper presentations, invited talks panels, demonstrations, teaching activities, hands-on practical exercises, general discussion. Please also list here any material you will make available to tutorial participants, e.g. slides, access to hardware/software, handouts, etc. 
  Planned outcomes of the workshop or tutorials: | What are you hoping to achieve by the end of the workshop or tutorials? Please list here any planned publications or other outputs arising from workshops. 
  Length: | Full-day or half-day.

 The ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI) is the annual premiere venue where researchers and practitioners meet and discuss state-of-the-art advances at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Ideal IUI submissions should address practical HCI challenges using machine intelligence and discuss both computational and human-centric aspects of such methodologies, techniques and systems.  
 Contributions are welcome from all relevant arenas, including academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations. We strongly believe that diverse insights are critical to the vitality of the IUI community and the conference will accept papers for both long and short oral presentations. Contributions to IUI are expected to be supported by rigorous evidence appropriate to the claims (e.g., user study, system evaluation, computational analysis).  
 Topics  
 IUI topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Human-centered AI methods, approaches, and systems  
 Explainable AI methods 
  Democratization of AI

  Papers  
 We invite original paper submissions that are not under consideration elsewhere. Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library and citation indices. A selected set of accepted top quality full papers will be invited to submit their extended versions for publication in an ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems ( TiiS  ) special issue titled “Highlights of IUI 2025” that will appear in 2026.  
 All accepted papers will be invited for oral presentation as part of the main conference program. Additionally, all authors of accepted papers are invited to present a poster of their work during the poster session.  
 We also encourage authors to discuss potential ethical considerations of their work; aspects pertaining to current societal issues; diversity, inclusion, and equality; and other topics under the broad responsible AI topic. We encourage authors to consider practical and societal implications of their work (as well as its shortcomings) throughout their projects and to include a reflection on those implications in their papers in particular how the proposed methods and insights could be applied and deployed in a realistic setting and how they can improve people’s lives in the real world.  
 Highlights of this year  
 We also encourage authors to discuss potential ethical considerations of their work; aspects pertaining to current societal issues; diversity, inclusion, and equality; and other topics under the broad responsible AI topic.  
 Reflection of practical and societal impact  
 We encourage authors to consider practical and societal implications of their work (as well as its shortcomings) throughout their projects and to include a reflection on those implications in their papers in particular how the proposed methods and insights could be applied and deployed in a realistic setting and how they can improve people's lives in the real world.  
 We also encourage authors to discuss potential ethical considerations of their work in terms of diversity inclusion, and equality; and other topics under the broad responsible AI topic and its societal impact. We recognize that technology is rarely neutral --- simply by making some things easier than others, it reshapes society ( Winner, 1980  ; Green, 2020  ). Further, given the incredibly short invention-to-application cycles for AI-related technologies, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that “somebody else” will carefully consider how an emerging intelligent user interface technology might impact the world before this technology is deployed. Because it is often difficult to anticipate the cumulative or indirect impacts of an invention, we provide a few concrete suggestions to consider throughout the research process and for reflecting on one’s work at the end.  
 Our purpose is to help authors ensure that the likely societal consequences of their work are consistent with their intentions and values. For colleagues who are not yet experienced with incorporating societal impacts into their IUI research but who are willing to give it a try, we prepared some simple ideas to consider  .  
 Platform  
 All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS 2.0 https://new.precisionconference.com/~sigchi  by the abstract and paper deadline.  
 In PCS 2.0, first click "Submissions" at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society conference, and track select "SIGCHI", "IUI 2025" and "IUI 2025 Papers", respectively, and press "Go".  
 Anonymization  
 ACM IUI uses a double-blind review process. All submissions (and supplemental materials) must be appropriately anonymized according to the following guidelines:  
 Authors' names and affiliations are not visible anywhere in the paper. 
  Acknowledgements should be anonymized or removed during the review process. 
  Self-citations should be included where necessary but must use the third person. For example, "... as shown in our previous user study [2] ... " is not allowed, whereas "... as shown in Smith et al. [2] " is acceptable (because in this case the citation [2] will NOT be perceived as self-citation). 
  Failure to follow these guidelines may result in submissions being desk rejected without review.  
 Authors should also be aware of the SIGCHI Policy for Submission and Review at SIGCHI Conferences  .  
 Accessibility  
 Authors are asked to make their paper submissions accessible (so that reviewers with vision impairments can access them, for example). The authors of accepted papers will be required to make their final PDFs accessible. Please use the SIGCHI Guide to an Accessible Submission  for detailed instructions.  
 If you are submitting a video as supplemental material, please provide captions, as described in Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos  .  
 Please refer to the Accessibility  page for further details and guidelines.  
 Submission format and length  
 We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow  .  
 Prepare your submission for review in a single column format, using the latest templates: Word Submission Template  , or the LaTeX template  using \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart}  for the LaTeX template.  
 Papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. We encourage authors to stay within a 10,000 word limit. Authors of papers exceeding 12,000 words should add a note at the end of their manuscript explaining how the length of the paper is commensurate with the contribution of the work.  
 Supplemental materials  
 Submitting supplemental material (e.g. questionnaires, demo videos of applications, data sheets) is optional but encouraged.  
 If supplying a demo video, please follow the SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos  .  
 Additional Policies  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .

  ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects 

 ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  

 ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects      
 Approved by ACM Publications Board on August 15, 2021      
 Background     
 ACM is committed to protecting the rights and welfare of all individuals participating in computing research. Research involving human participants and subjects raises ethical concerns regarding informed consent, risks to participants and subjects, and potential coercion. In many countries and jurisdictions around the world such research is subject to regulations, including regulations requiring review by a review board prior to conducting such research.    
 While many of these regulations were first developed to govern medical research, such as the Declaration of Helsinki  , they have generally been extended to include behavioral research, including some research in computing. While these regulations generally derive from the same principles, they differ in terms of which research is covered and in the specific review processes and criteria employed.    
 In developing this Policy, ACM carefully reviewed The Belmont Report  and derived many of the same principles as identified and explained in this report.    
 In recent years, it has become common for research publications to have policies governing research with human participants and subjects and to require researchers engaged in such research to make declarations, prior to publication, that they have acted in accordance with both ACM’s Policy and any local or governmental laws and regulations governing their research.    
 Furthermore, in addition to Primary Publishers’ developing and ratifying policies involving human participants and subjects research, many secondary publishers, such as Clarivate and international ethics organizations, like the Committee on Publication Ethics  , have in recent years implemented their own requirements and guidelines for published research that involved human participants and subjects. To the greatest extent possible, ACM aims to comply with these requirements.    
 Reasons for Policy     
 As the number of articles ACM publishes that include research based on human participants and subjects rises, it is a moral imperative that ACM establishes a clear policy setting standards for practice in connection with ACM Publications. Simply put, it is the right thing to do and it is important for all stakeholders in the publication process, including authors, reviewers, editors, program committees, readers, and third parties making ACM publications discoverable to the world to know that any research published in an ACM publication venue can be trusted to be based on ethical research standards and practices.    
 Definition of Human Participant and Subject Research     
 ACM adopts the definition of Human Subjects Research used by the US National Institutes of Health as “Research involving a living individual about whom data or biospecimens are obtained/used/studied/analyzed through interaction/intervention, or identifiable, private information is used/studied/analyzed/generated” (see https://grants.nih.gov/sites/default/files/human-subjects-research-infographic.pdf  )    
 Policy Statement     
 All authors conducting research involving human participants and subjects must meet appropriate ethical and legal standards guiding such research. In particular, ACM authors must ensure that their human research planning, conduct, and reporting are consistent with their local governing laws and regulations and the general principles detailed below. It is important to note that something may not be ethical even though it is not prohibited by local law or regulation, and thus authors should also ensure alignment that their research practices are compliant with the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  and international and national standards for such research, such as The Declaration of Helsinki  , The Belmont Report  , and The Common Rule  , including, but not limited to:    
 minimization of potential harms, making sure any risks are justified by potential benefits 
  protection for the privacy and right to self-determination of participants and subjects 
  adhering to relevant institutional, local, national, and international regulations 
  adhering to the principle of informed consent 
  adhering to the principle of justice 
  adherence with all other applicable ACM policies 
  Where such research is conducted in countries where no such local governing laws and regulations related to human participant and subject research exist, Authors must at a bare minimum be prepared to show compliance with the above detailed principles. Authors should also declare any potential conflicts of interest in compliance with the Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  , so that reviewers and editors may determine whether the declared COIs are significant enough to warrant rejection of the Work or another appropriate remedy.    
 Individual ACM Publications, such as an ACM Journal or Conference Proceeding, may specify a more restrictive policy than required by local legal requirements, however, where an individual ACM Publication (i.e. - conference, journal, etc.) implements a more restrictive policy, the requirements for this stricter policy must be clearly communicated in the Instructions for Authors section of that publication’s website and must be included in any and all publicly distributed Calls for Papers for that publication venue, such as for an ACM Conference.    
 Scope of Policy       
 This policy applies to all ACM Publications, including ACM Sponsored, co-Sponsored, or In-Cooperation Conferences, International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS) proceedings, journals, magazines, books, newsletters, or any research data or content published in the ACM Digital Library as primary objects.    
 Roles and Responsibilities     
 Authors.  It is the authors’ responsibility (each author individually and the authors collectively) to comply with and provide evidence of compliance with this Policy. Where local ethical review boards are required, authors are responsible for having their research reviewed and approved by such boards. Authors are also responsible for the overall ethical conduct of their research. All ACM Authors must be prepared to provide documentary evidence to ACM that they have adhered to local ethical and legal standards, as ACM may require documentary evidence of such approval at any time following submission of the Work and prior to or after publication of the Work.    
 Editors-in-Chief and Program Committee Chairs.  EICs and Program Chairs are responsible for communicating the existence of this policy to authors. They are also responsible for setting and communicating any publication-specific human subjects research policy, after consulting with ACM Staff and the Chair of the ACM Ethics and Plagiarism Committee, with the requirement that such policies must be no less restrictive than this policy. Editors-in-Chief and Program Committee Chairs are responsible for determining the appropriate mechanisms for ensuring compliance with this policy (including optionally including questions about human participants and subjects research on review forms and requiring submission of any required documentation as part of article submission) and have the ultimate responsibility for determining whether a submission under review should be rejected for violation of this policy.    
 Peer Reviewers.  Reviewers have the opportunity (and if specified by the Editor-in-Chief or the Program Committee Chair, the responsibility) to consider whether human subjects research they are reviewing was conducted ethically and in compliance with local requirements. Such issues may be raised in reviews or directly to the appropriate Editor or Program Committee member.    
 Publications Board Ethics and Plagiarism Committee.  The Publications Board Ethics and Plagiarism Committee is responsible for deciding cases involving alleged violations of this policy in published Works as discussed below. The committee may also be consulted for advice on cases prior to publication by journal EICs or conference Program Committee Chairs.    
 ACM Staff.  ACM Staff is responsible for communication of this policy to authors through the ACM Web site and other author-facing ACM sites, in the ACM Digital Library, ACM SIG sites, and in individual ACM Publications, such as journals, magazines, conference proceedings, books, etc.    
 Violations and Penalties     
 ACM will investigate potential violations of this Policy when receiving a credible claim from a named individual(s) that an ACM author(s) may have violated this Policy. To the greatest extent possible, the identity of claimants shall be kept confidential.    
 When an allegation of potential misconduct relates to an unpublished submission to an ACM journal, magazine, or book, the Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Publication will work directly with either the author(s) to ensure compliance with this Policy or will have the obligation to reject the submission.    
 When an allegation of potential misconduct relates to an unpublished submission to an ACM conference or ICPS conference, the Program Committee Chair(s) will work directly with either the author(s) to ensure compliance with this Policy prior to publication in the ACM Digital Library or will have the obligation to reject the submission.    
 When an allegation of potential misconduct relates to a Work already published by ACM in the ACM DL, a determination of whether that work violates this policy shall be made by the ACM Publications Board. ACM Staff will work closely with the Ethics + Plagiarism Committee of the ACM Publications Board to investigate and advise on the case.    
 In the event it is determined that the Policy has been violated and depending on the circumstances and severity of the violation, a Level 2-5 penalty may be assessed, at the sole discretion of the Ethics + Plagiarism Committee or ACM Publications Board, which may include, depending on the severity of the violation a “Note of Concern” on the Work’s citation page or a Retraction of the published Work in the ACM Digital Library, as per ACM’s policy and procedures for retracting Works in the ACM Digital Library and in accordance with ACM’s Penalties for Publication Violations  .

 ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI) 2025 is the 30th annual premiere venue, where researchers and practitioners will meet and discuss state-of-the-art advances at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Ideal IUI submissions should address practical HCI challenges using machine intelligence and discuss both computational and human-centric aspects of such methodologies, techniques, and systems. We welcome contributions from related fields such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, and more. Our focus is to improve the interaction between humans and machines, by leveraging both HCI approaches and state-of-the-art AI techniques from machine learning, natural language processing, data mining, knowledge representation and reasoning. ACM IUI welcomes contributions from all relevant arenas, academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations, and gives its participants the opportunity to present and see cutting-edge IUI work in a focused and interactive setting.  
 Posters  
 Posters provide an opportunity for sharing valuable last-minute ideas, eliciting useful feedback on early-stage work and fostering discussions and collaborations among colleagues. We invite submissions relevant to all conference topics. All submissions should convey a scientific result or work in progress that is not yet ready to be published as a full-length research paper at a refereed conference.  
 The page limit for poster papers is 4 pages (references do not count toward the page limit). Submitting a draft poster along with your submission is not required but is recommended. Accepted poster papers will appear in the companion proceedings of the conference. Each accepted contribution is expected to be presented in person during the poster session.  
 Demos  
 The demonstration track complements the overall program of the conference. Demonstrations show implementations of novel, interesting, and important intelligent user interface concepts or systems. We invite submissions relevant to intelligent user interfaces and which address, but are not limited to, the topics of the conference. All submissions are intended to convey a scientific result or work in progress and should not be advertisements for commercial software packages.  
 The page limit for demo papers is 4 pages (references do not count toward the page limit). Authors further need to submit a video (max. 5 mins) along with their demo paper to showcase their work. Accepted demo papers will be presented as interactive demonstrations at IUI and published in the companion proceedings of the conference. Each accepted contribution is expected to be presented in person during the demo sessions.  
 Authors who submitted a long or short research paper are welcome to also propose a demo of their work to exemplify their work at the conference (In this case, the paper will not be included in the ACM Digital Library). Alternatively, the authors of accepted papers (at IUI 2025) may also opt to submit a regular 4-page paper for the demonstration, which will be included in the ACM Digital Library if accepted.  
 Topics  
 In addition to the conference topics, we would like to encourage authors to also consider the following topics:  
 Enhance Web Accessibility through the AI 
  Intelligent Human-Robot Applications

 In conjunction with the 30th International ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI 2025)  
 Cagliari, Italy  
 March 24-27, 2025 https://iui.acm.org/2025/   
 Call for Proposals  
 We are pleased to invite proposals for workshops and tutorials to be held in conjunction with the conference.  
 The goal of the workshops is to provide a venue for presenting research on focused topics of interest and an informal forum to discuss research questions and challenges. Potential workshop topics should be related to the general theme of the conference.  
 Tutorials are designed to provide fundamental knowledge and experience on topics related to intelligent user interfaces, and the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
 Note: We encourage you to contact the chairs with your ideas ( workshops2025@iui.acm.org  ), and work together to prepare an exciting proposal.  
 We encourage proposals for a wide range of workshop and tutorial formats and activities including but not limited to:  
 "Mini-conferences" on specialized topics | ; such workshops may have their own paper submission and review processes. 
  Interactive formats | to explore a certain topic during the workshop (e.g., through breakoutrooms); such workshops may have their own paper submission and review process or target a report summarizing the outcome of the interactive discussions. 
  "Late breaking work" | meetings; such workshops usually have a lighter review process (e.g.based on abstracts only). 
  "Hands-on" workshops | around a specific problem or topic that may wish to ask participants to submit a position statement. 
  "Project centric" workshops | that may be closely related to the scope of an existing large-scale (e.g. NSF, EU, etc. funded) project. 
  "Mini-competitions", challenges, or hackathons | around selected topics with individual or team participation. 
  Tutorials | on a specific topic relevant to IUI; for example, methods and approaches in HCI and AI, specific techniques or algorithms to develop intelligent user interfaces, etc. 
  We invite submissions of proposals for full-day and half-day workshops or tutorials. Proposals will be reviewed and evaluated by the workshop and tutorial chairs.  
 Workshops with few submissions may be cancelled, shortened, merged with other workshops, or otherwise restructured. The organizers of accepted workshops and tutorials are responsible for producing a call for participation and publicizing it, such as distributing the call to relevant newsgroups and electronic mailing lists, and especially to potential audiences from outside the IUI conference community. Workshop and tutorial organizers will maintain their own website with information about the workshop or tutorial and the ACM IUI 2025 website will refer to this website. The workshop organizers will coordinate the paper solicitation, collection, and review process. Workshops’ and tutorials’ summary will be included in the ACM Digital Library for ACM IUI 2025, and we will separately publish a joint workshop proceedings for accepted workshop submissions (through CEUR or similar).  
 Proposal Format  
 Workshop or tutorial proposals should be a maximum of four pages long (single-column format). Prepare your submission using the latest templates: Word Submission Template  , or the LaTeX template  .  
 Please submit your workshop and tutorial at https://new.precisionconference.com/~sigchi  under the IUI 2025 Workshops and Tutorials track. In PCS 2.0, first click "Submissions" at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select "SIGCHI", "IUI 2025" and "IUI 2025 Workshops and Tutorials", respectively, and press "Go".  
 The proposals should be organized as follows:  
 Name and title: | A one-word acronym and a full title. Please indicate “(Workshop)” or “(Tutorial)” after the title, as appropriate. 
  Description of workshop or tutorial topic: | This description should discuss the relevance of the suggested topic to IUI and its interest for the IUI 2025 audience. Include a brief discussion of why and for which audience the workshop or tutorial is of particular interest. 
  Previous history: | List of previous workshops or tutorials that were held on the topic including the conferences that hosted past workshops or tutorials and the number of participants. 
  Organizer(s): | Names, affiliations, emails, and web pages of the organizer(s). Provide a brief description of the background of the organizer(s). Strong proposals normally include organizers who bring differing perspectives on the topic and are actively connected to the communities of potential participants. Please indicate the primary contact person and the organizers who plan to attend the workshop. Also please provide a list of other workshops or tutorials organized by workshop organizers in the past. 
  Workshop program committee: | Names and affiliation of the members of the (tentative) workshop program committee that will evaluate the workshop submissions. 
  Participants: | A statement saying how many participants you expect and how you plan to invite participants for the workshop or tutorial. If possible, include the names of at least 10 people who have expressed interest to participate in the workshop or tutorial. 
  Workshop or Tutorial activities: | A brief description of the format regarding the mix of events or activities, such as paper presentations, invited talks panels, demonstrations, teaching activities, hands-on practical exercises, general discussion. Please also list here any material you will make available to tutorial participants, e.g. slides, access to hardware/software, handouts, etc. 
  Planned outcomes of the workshop or tutorials: | What are you hoping to achieve by the end of the workshop or tutorials? Please list here any planned publications or other outputs arising from workshops. 
  Length: | Full-day or half-day.

   CALL FOR BIDS for Organizing ACM IVA 2025 The annual ACM Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) is the premier international event for interdisciplinary research on the development, application, and evaluation of intelligent virtual agents with the specific focus on the ability to interact socially. Such agents can be embodied graphically (e.g. virtual characters, embodied conversational agents) or physically (e.g. robots). They are capable of real-time perception, cognition, emotion and action allowing them to participate in dynamic social environments. This includes human-like interaction qualities such as multimodal communication using facial expressions, speech, and gesture, conversational interaction, socially assistive and affective interaction, interactive task-oriented cooperation, or social behavior simulation. IVAs are highly relevant for and widely applied in many societally important domains including health, education, training, entertainment, at the work place or for assisted living. The 24^th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents will be held in presence, September 16^th – 20^th 2024, organized at Glasgow University: https://iva.acm.org/2024/  ** We are calling for bids to organize the next conference in 2024, preferably in the 3^rd and 4^th week of September. Interested groups should prepare an application consisting of: * Conference location: description of the conference venue and nearby accommodations; description of public transportation and access from nearby airports * Conference organization: description of the organizing committees; conference dates that fit best to avoid conflict with other conferences * Conference budget: estimation of the budget with different numbers of participants, and including margins and fees by ACM: https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/conference-planning/table-of-contents  < https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/conference-planning/table-of-contents  > * A special topic that may be featured in IVA 2025 The deadline to submit applications is: June 28^th 2023 Applications should be sent to: * Catherine Pelachaud catherine.pelachaud at upmc.fr  <mailto: catherine.pelachaud at upmc.fr  > * Stefan Kopp skopp at techfak.uni-bielefeld.de  <mailto: skopp at techfak.uni-bielefeld.de  > * Hannes Högni Vilhjálmsson hannes at ru.is  Notification of acceptance will be shortly before IVA2024 so that the next conference venue can be announced at this year’s conference. -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

 Call for Papers  
 Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) Annual Conference is the premier international event for interdisciplinary research on the design, application, and evaluation of Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) with a specific focus on the ability to socially interact.  
 IVA 2024, the 24th Annual Conference, will be held in Glasgow, Scotland, September 16-19, 2024.   
 Note IVA 2024 will be co-located with the conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), with select joint sessions and social events and the ability to attend ACII paper sessions.   
 IVAs are interactive characters that exhibit human-like capabilities including communicating using natural human modalities such as facial expressions, speech and gesture. IVAs are also capable of real-time perception, cognition, emotion and action that allows them to participate in dynamic social interactions.  
 IVA 2024 aims to showcase cutting-edge research on the design, application, and evaluation of IVAs, as well as the basic research underlying the technology that supports human-agent interaction such as social perception, dialog modeling, and social behavior planning. We also welcome submissions on central theoretical issues, uses of virtual agents in psychological research and showcases of working applications.  
 IVA 2024 offers two submission tracks: Papers (8 pages, not including references) and Extended Abstracts (3 pages, not including references).  
 All submissions will be double-blind peer-reviewed by expert reviewers. All accepted full paper submissions will be presented orally and published in the proceedings. Accepted extended abstracts will be presented as a talk or a poster, depending on the outcome of the review process. Accepted extended abstracts will also be published in the proceedings, unless the authors do not want it published.  
 Interdisciplinary Format   
 IVA is traditionally a highly interdisciplinary conference. As part of ensuring that, IVA 2024 will account for different publication norms across disciplines. For example, conference publication is a norm in Computer Science whereas journal publications are the norm in Psychology. To accommodate these differences while fostering trans-disciplinary interaction, accepted extended abstracts may be selected for oral presentation in addition to the standard of a poster presentation. Also, authors of extended abstracts will have the option of whether their abstract publication is archival.  
 SCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS   
 IVA invites submissions on a broad range of topics, including but not limited to:  
 Agent design and modeling of:   
 Cognition 
  Emotion (including personality and cultural differences) 
  Socially communicative behavior (e.g., of emotions, personality traits) 
  Conversational behavior 
  Social perception 
  Machine learning approaches to agent modeling 
  Approaches to realizing adaptive behavior 
  Models informed by theoretical and empirical research in psychology 
  Multimodal interaction:   
 Verbal and nonverbal behavior coordination 
  Face-to-face communication skills 
  Engagement 
  Managing co-presence and interpersonal relation 
  Multi-party interaction 
  Data driven multimodal modeling 
  Social agent architectures:   
 Design criteria and design methodologies 
  Engineering of real-time human-agent interaction 
  Standards / measures to support interoperability 
  Portability and reuse 
  Specialized tools, toolkits and tool chains 
  Evaluation methods and studies:   
 Evaluation methodologies and user studies 
  Ethical considerations and societal impact 
  Applicable lessons across fields (e.g. between robotics and virtual agents) 
  Social agents as a means to study and model human behavior 
  Applications:   
 Applications in education, skills training, health, counseling, games, art, etc. 
  Virtual agents in games and simulations 
  Social agents as tools in psychology 
  Migration of agents between platforms 
   
 Special Theme   
 A special theme this year at IVA will be on the use of multimodal machine learning and large language/foundation models in agent design and implementation, as well as comparison of these techniques to alternative approaches. These advances promise to make virtual agents more robust, human-like and capable of autonomous open-ended interaction. At the same time these advances can raise critical ramifications for the design process’s ability to ensure the behavior of the agent is appropriately circumscribed for an application.  
 Note: IVA 2024 will as usual have a doctoral consortium  , workshops and demos  .

 Special Theme   
 A special theme this year at IVA will be on the use of multimodal machine learning and large language/foundation models in agent design and implementation, as well as comparison of these techniques to alternative approaches. These advances promise to make virtual agents more robust, human-like and capable of autonomous open-ended interaction. At the same time these advances can raise critical ramifications for the design process’s ability to ensure the behavior of the agent is appropriately circumscribed for an application.  
 Note: IVA 2024 will as usual have a doctoral consortium  , workshops and demos  .

 Call for Papers  

 Call for Papers  
 Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) Annual Conference is the premier international event for interdisciplinary research on the design, application, and evaluation of Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) with a specific focus on the ability to socially interact.  
 IVA 2024, the 24th Annual Conference, will be held in Glasgow, Scotland, September 16-19, 2024.   
 Note IVA 2024 will be co-located with the conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), with select joint sessions and social events and the ability to attend ACII paper sessions.   
 IVAs are interactive characters that exhibit human-like capabilities including communicating using natural human modalities such as facial expressions, speech and gesture. IVAs are also capable of real-time perception, cognition, emotion and action that allows them to participate in dynamic social interactions.  
 IVA 2024 aims to showcase cutting-edge research on the design, application, and evaluation of IVAs, as well as the basic research underlying the technology that supports human-agent interaction such as social perception, dialog modeling, and social behavior planning. We also welcome submissions on central theoretical issues, uses of virtual agents in psychological research and showcases of working applications.  
 IVA 2024 offers two submission tracks: Papers (8 pages, not including references) and Extended Abstracts (3 pages, not including references).  
 All submissions will be double-blind peer-reviewed by expert reviewers. All accepted full paper submissions will be presented orally and published in the proceedings. Accepted extended abstracts will be presented as a talk or a poster, depending on the outcome of the review process. Accepted extended abstracts will also be published in the proceedings, unless the authors do not want it published.  
 Interdisciplinary Format   
 IVA is traditionally a highly interdisciplinary conference. As part of ensuring that, IVA 2024 will account for different publication norms across disciplines. For example, conference publication is a norm in Computer Science whereas journal publications are the norm in Psychology. To accommodate these differences while fostering trans-disciplinary interaction, accepted extended abstracts may be selected for oral presentation in addition to the standard of a poster presentation. Also, authors of extended abstracts will have the option of whether their abstract publication is archival.  
 SCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS   
 IVA invites submissions on a broad range of topics, including but not limited to:  
 Agent design and modeling of:   
 Cognition 
  Emotion (including personality and cultural differences) 
  Socially communicative behavior (e.g., of emotions, personality traits)

  SCOPE  
 The International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications aims at becoming a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners in Information Visualization. The conference will be structured around several Information and Data Visualization topics (listed below), and we welcome papers describing original work in any of these topics. We also encourage papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques, general survey papers indicating future directions, and theoretical or empirical contributions. Paper acceptance will be based on quality, relevance to the conference theme and originality. The conference program will focus on oral and poster presentations, although proposals for sessions dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, are also encouraged.   
   
  CONFERENCE AREAS  
 Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas:

 SCOPE The International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications aims at becoming a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners in Information Visualization. The conference will be structured around several Information and Data Visualization topics (listed below), and we welcome papers describing original work in any of these topics. We also encourage papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques, general survey papers indicating future directions, and theoretical or empirical contributions. Paper acceptance will be based on quality, relevance to the conference theme and originality. The conference program will focus on oral and poster presentations, although proposals for sessions dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, are also encouraged. CONFERENCE AREAS Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas: 1. INFORMATION VISUALIZATION 2. SCIENTIFIC VISUALIZATION 3. VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES AREA 1: INFORMATION VISUALIZATION Algorithm Transparency Data Driven Storytelling Dynamic or Temporal Data Visualisation Multi-sensory Data Presentation Small-screen visualisation Databases and Visualization, Visual Data Mining Explainable AI and Visualization Graph Visualization Internet, Web and Security Visualization Multi-dimensional or Multivariate data visualisation Software Visualization Text and Document Visualization AREA 2: SCIENTIFIC VISUALIZATION Biomedical Visualization and Applications Flow Visualization Geographic Information Visualisation GPU-based Visualization Uncertainty Visualization Virtual Environments and Data Visualization Volume Visualization Visualization Tools and Systems for Simulation and Modeling AREA 3: VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES Coordinated and Multiple Views Glyph-Based Visualization Human-Centered Aspects of Visualization Immersive Analytics Perception and Cognition in Visualization Usability and Empirical Studies of Visualizations Visual Analytics Visualization Algorithms and Technologies Visualization Applications Big Data Visualisation Data Management and Knowledge Representation High-Dimensional Data and Dimensionality Reduction Visual Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery Visual Representation and Interaction  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-06-30

Previous meetings were held in Paris (France, 1991), Ube (Japan, 1992), Washington DC (USA, 1994), Lyon (France, 1995), Hiroshima (Japan, 1997), Madras (India, 1999), Caen (France, 2000), Philadelphia (USA, 2001), Palermo (Italy, 2003), Auckland (New Zealand, 2004), Berlin (Germany, 2006), Buffalo, NY (USA, 2008), Playa del Carmen (Mexico, 2009), Madrid (Spain, 2011), Austin (Texas, 2012), Brno (Czech Republic, 2014), Kolkata (India, 2015), Porto (Portugal, 2018), Novi Sad (Serbia, 2020), and Messina (Italy, 2022).  
 Image analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the "discrete approach" to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.  
 The scientific program of the workshop consists of keynote talks and contributed papers.  
 The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer's "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" series (pending approval).  
 Topics  
 The Workshop is a forum for current research on the following (or similar) research subjects which are directly or potentially applicable to image analysis:  
 Combinatorial problems in the discrete plane and space; Lattice polygons and polytopes 
  Digital/combinatorial geometry and topology 
  Digital manifolds; Geometry of digital curves and surfaces 
  Analysis and processing of digital surfaces with singularities (such as "pinched digital surfaces") 
  Homotopy of digital manifolds; thinning algorithms and skeletons 
  Boundary tracking of digital solids; Geometric characteristics of object boundaries 
  Multigrid convergence analysis of metric-based descriptors 
  Tilings and patterns; Combinatorial pattern matching 
  Computational geometry and imaging sciences 
  Integer programming, linear programming, and graph theoretic models and approaches to problems of image analysis 
  Image representation, segmentation, grouping, and reconstruction 
  Processing "very large" digital pictures; Methods for image compression 
  Parallel architectures and algorithms 
  Fuzzy and stochastic image analysis 
  Discrete tomography 
  Grammars and models for image or scene analysis and recognition; cellular automata 
  Mathematical morphology and image analysis 
  Applications in medical imaging, biometrics, computer vision, image understanding, robotics, metrology, and others 
  The submitted papers are expected to meet high standards satisfying serious evaluation criteria. Each paper will be reviewed thoroughly by at least two members of the Program Committee. Double-blind review process will be applied to ensure maximal objectiveness.

 ABOUT THE SYMPOSIUM  
 The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the eighteenth Symposium in the series, which is sponsored by Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence  .  
 We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.  
 Work that will have been published as of January 2024 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.  
 Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence  , published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.  
 PAPER SUBMISSIONS  
 Please select Paper Submissions  from the sidebar for instructions on how to submit a paper.

  Nobel Prize to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton  
 At IWANN we join in the congratulation to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton for the Nobel Prize in Physics  awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. We are ecstatic by the recognition of the field of Machine Learning and Neural Networks implied by the prize. Already at the first IWANN  edition in 1991, two papers ( this  and this  ) had the word “Hopfield” in their title, bearing witness to the high interest that John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton’s work has always raised in IWANN audience.  
 Tutorial: AI and Digital Twins in Healthcare  
 We are glad to announce that the tutorial AI and Digital Twins in Healthcare  will take place during IWANN 2025, delivered by Julià Camps. The tutorial can be attended by all IWANN 2025 participants, with no need for an additional registration.  
 First Call for Papers  
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee of the International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN 2025), we are pleased to invite you to participate in this event that will be held in June 2025 in A Coruña (Spain). This will be the 18th edition of IWANN, following on from an uninterrupted sequence of a staggering 34 years.  
 This biennial meeting seeks to provide a discussion forum for scientists, engineers, educators and students about the latest discoveries and realizations in the foundations, theory, models and applications of systems inspired by nature, as well as in emerging areas related to the above items, using computational intelligence methodologies. As in previous editions, we strongly emphasize the wide range of topics comprised under the umbrella of IWANN2025, from which we present a non-exhaustive list of areas of interest for the congress to get a flavour of IWANN25’s orientation:  
 Mathematical and theoretical methods in computational intelligence 
  Deep Learning 
  Learning and adaptation 
  Emulation of cognitive functions 
  Bio-inspired systems and neuro-engineering 
  Advanced topics in computational intelligence 
  Agent based models 
  Time series forecasting 
  Robotics and cognitive systems 
  Interactive systems and BCI 
  Machine Learning for 4.0 industry solutions 
  AI Health 
  AI in 5G technology 
  Social and Ethical aspects of AI 
  General Applications of AI 
  The approach will be both theoretical and practical, through invited talks, tutorials, workshops, posters, presentation of demos and functional prototypes. Besides, we offer the possibility to carry out a limited number of virtual presentations for those who want to participate but have serious difficulties to travel. The proceedings will include all the presented communications to the conference. As in previous editions of IWANN, we are arranging the publication of the proceedings with Springer-Verlag as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and the books will be available shortly after the Congress in order to allow the authors to incorporate suggestions and improvements from the presentations. It is also foreseen the publication of extended versions of selected papers in special issues of several prestigious journals. Previous congresses led to special issues of Neural Computing and Applications, PLoS One and Neural Processing Letters. We are working to have at least the same collaborations.  
 We hope to see you in A Coruña next June. Do not miss on the deadline  !!

  How customer reviews and ratings work   Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings, help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.  
 To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness.
