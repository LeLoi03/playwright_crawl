 Welcome  
  
 The European Chapter of the ACL  (EACL) is the primary professional association for computational linguistics in Europe. It provides a number of services to its members and the community:  
 The | 18th EACL conference | will be held in St. Julians, Malta, from 17 to 22 of March, 2024. As the flagship European conference in the field of computational linguistics, EACL welcomes European and international researchers covering a broad spectrum of research areas that are concerned with computational approaches to natural language. 
  Support for educational initiatives in the field -- for example, EACL-sponsored courses at ESSLLI summer schools and student grants for selected Computational Linguistics events.

 About  
  
 The formation of a European Chapter of the ACL (EACL) was announced at the annual ACL meeting in 1982 in Toronto. The Chapter's primary objectives were to eliminate what were then real obstacles for European membership: high bank charges for payment of dues, high postal rates for distribution of mailings, and transatlantic travel costs to meetings based exclusively in North America. To address these needs EACL offered international banking facilities in Europe, a European mail distribution centre, and a biennial European conference. The founding Board of the EACL was composed of: Eva Hajicova (Chair), Harold Somers (Secretary), Mike Rosner (Treasurer), an Advisory Committee (Hubert Lehmann, Remko Scha and Yorick Wilks) and a Nominating Committee (Giacomo Ferrari, Gerald Gazdar, Peter Hellwig and Bente Maegaard).  
 Many of the initial motivations for the foundation of EACL are no longer relevant, mainly due to the Internet, online banking, and the transformation of ACL from an American to an international organisation in 1997. Nevertheless EACL has remained the primary professional association for computational linguistics in Europe, serving its members not only through its biennial meeting, but also through support for educational initiatives in the field -- for example, EACL-sponsored introductory courses in CL at ESSLLI summer schools, the European Masters in Speech and Language, and studentships at specialist workshops.  
 The flagship event remains the EACL conference, whose inaugural edition was held in Pisa, September 1983, with Giacomo Ferrari as the conference chair. By all accounts it was a huge success, and set the stage for a very productive series of conferences. Looking back through the proceedings of that conference, one discerns a strong European flavour compared to ACL. For example, of the 32 papers at EACL'83, 10 were about languages other than English, compared to only 2 out of 25 at ACL'83.

 Support for Educational Programmes  
  
 EACL, as an official organization representing computational linguistics (CL) in Europe, encourages the general development of educational programs for CL that promote the field and encourage its diffusion throughout Europe. In particular, EACL encourages programmes that operate at a multi-national level, such as exchange support programs for students and faculty.  
 However, EACL does not have the capacity to evaluate any specific CL educational programme, and thus cannot provide official approval or accreditation for such programmes. Accordingly, general support for specific programmes can only be granted in such a way that it cannot be used in a competitive way relative to other comparable activities.  
  
 Sponsorship  
  
 Scale  
 Each year, the EACL may make available a limited number of sponsorships each worth a relatively small amount of money. Sponsorships are awarded only if the EACL budget allows it.  
 As an indication, in recent years the EACL has typically awarded 10-15 sponsorships of approximately 500 Euros each.  
 Focus  
 In awarding sponsorships, EACL focuses on education in computational linguistics in the geographical area of the EACL. Priority is given to students from Eastern Europe and more generally, to students from countries with hard currency problems (within the geographical area covered by EACL).  
 In the past, EACL has sponsored introductory courses at European summer-schools (in the form of a contribution towards the presenters' expenses), participation at summer-schools (funding tuition fees and subsistence expenses for students who would otherwise not have been able to come) and participation at student workshops at EACL conferences (contribution towards student-presenters' expenses).  
 Visibility  
 In return for sponsorship, EACL expects some visibility (for instance the sponsorship is announced in a workshop programme and website etc.). A request for sponsorship must include a description of the visibility for EACL generated by the sponsorship.  
 Procedure  
 A request for sponsorship should identify a concrete purpose. Indeed EACL will not sponsor a school or workshop in general, but it will sponsor a particular course, tutorial, etc., or it will sponsor participation for a particular group of students etc.  
 A request for sponsorship should contain the following information:  
 A short description of the event involved (summer school conference, student workshp etc.) and of its relevance to computational linguistics 
  A proposal for ensuring EACL visibility in return for sponsorship 
  A specification of the intended use of sponsorship -- this should state the precise purpose of the sponsorhip (e.g., fee waiving for students/participants, travel grants, accommodation cost) and a clear description of how funding will be used. 
  Motivation and justification for request. 
  When the sponsorship is requested in view of funding the participation of individuals (students, scholars, lecturers etc.) to the event, the selection of the sponsorship recipients will be done jointly by the EACL and the requesting party as follows:  
 The requesting party will make a selection and submit it for approval to the EACL board. 
  The selection will be provided to the EACL together with any information judged relevant. For instance, in the case of a request for supporting student participation, the following information about the candidates should be included: | Name, email address, affiliation and status (PhD year etc.) of the candidate 
  Source and amount of yearly income 
  Letter of motivation 
  Whether the candidate makes a presentation at the event 
  Proof of student status 
  Letter of recommendation (e.g., from supervisor) 
  Requests for sponsorships should be directed by email to one of the EACL board members, who passes on the request to the board.  
 The EACL board decides within a month on a sponsorship request. Sponsorships are normally requested by and awarded to conferences workshops, summer schools etc. Sponsorship requests from individuals will not be considered.  
  
 Event endorsement  
  
 In order for EACL to endorse a conference or similar event, two criteria must be fulfilled:  
 Relevance: | The event must have a clear connection to computational linguistics and to the geographical area of EACL. 
  Quality: | The event should satisfy basic requirements on scientific quality concerning program committee, review procedure, etc. 
  The endorsement of an event by EACL entails the following:  
 Organizers must say that the event is endorsed by EACL in their announcements (website, call for papers, call for participation, etc.). 
  Organizers must put a link to the EACL website ( | http://www.eacl.org/ | ) on their website. 
  EACL will put a link to the event website on the EACL website. 
  If there are published proceedings, the organizers must mention in the proceedings that the event is endorsed by EACL.

 MT Summit 2025: CALL FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST   
 June 30, 2023 (updated on June 30, 2023) 
    
 The European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT) invites expressions of interest to host the MT Summit 2025 conference, to be held in Europe, the Middle East or Africa (EMEA) between Summer and Autumn 2025. This will be the 20th Machine Translation Summit, which takes place bi-annually and its organisation and is overseen by the International Association for Machine Translation (IAMT), rotating between the sister organisations: EAMT, AMTA (Association for Machine Translation in the Americas) and AAMT (Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation).  
 At this stage, we seek draft proposals from prospective bidders. These will be evaluated and promising bidders will be asked to provide additional information for the final selection. The EAMT president will act as general chair and will work together with local organisers to design and shape the conference, including the appointment of chairs.  
 Draft proposals (due August 20, 2023) should include information on all of the following items:  
  1. Proposed dates: between Spring and Autumn 2025  
  2. Location: city and conference venue. Indicate whether the conference would be held at a university, hotel or convention centre. Bear in mind that EAMT is growing and we expect the same will happen with MT Summit. While Ghent (EAMT 2022) had around 120 registered participants, Tampere (EAMT 2023) had around 190 registered participants. The last in person MT Summit (Dublin, 2019) had around 300 participants. So please suggest a location that could host 400+ people for the main conference sessions, plus at least 4 conference rooms hosting parallel workshops and tutorials (100 people each), a large poster or exhibit room; and room for registration  
  3. Local arrangements team: local chair/co-chair, committee (identifying a coordinator to be co-opted as EAMT executive committee member), volunteer labour (e.g. students), registration handling. The local arrangements team will be responsible for activities such as arranging meeting rooms, equipment, refreshments, accommodation, on-site registration, participant internet access, the reception, the conference dinner, and working with the other chairs and the EAMT Board to develop the budget and registration materials. Indicate whether any national/regional Computational Linguistics association would be on board of the local organisation  
  4. Computing/wifi/audiovisual: whether there will be desktop/laptop in conference rooms and high-speed wireless Internet access, what the audiovisual facilities are  
  5. Food catering including breaks, reception, poster sessions and conference dinner  
  6. Social events including infrastructure for banquet/other social event and reception  
  7. Potential for local sponsorships  
  8. Opportunities for co-location with other meetings  
  9. The costs related to all of the above items, which should be indicated in the expenses spreadsheet (template provided below).  
 Proposals will be evaluated with respect to a number of criteria (unordered):  
  ● Adequacy of conference and exhibit facilities for the anticipated number of registrants  
  ● Adequacy of accommodations and food services (in a range of price categories) and proximity to the conference facilities  
  ● Adequacy of expenses projections and expected surplus  
  ● Appropriateness of proposed dates  
  ● Geographical and national balance with regard to previous EACL and ACL conferences, and other major Natural Language Processing conferences held in EMEA  
  ● Co-location with national/regional conferences  
  ● Experience of the local arrangements team  
  ● Local CL community support

 Sustainability statement  
 For all tracks, we strongly encourage work complying with the “Green AI” principles (Schwartz et al. 2020) and focusing on reducing the environmental cost of MT model training and usage by, among others, improving training and inference efficiency. Furthermore, we strongly encourage authors who carry out computational experiments to report average runtime for each model/algorithm, estimate energy cost and to add a carbon impact statement  to their paper following the guidelines by Henderson et al. (2020).  
 Below is a list of tools that can be used to estimate carbon emissions of an experiment:  
 ML CO2 IMPACT (Lacoste et al. 2019) 
  Green Algorithm (Lannelongue et al. 2021)

 We seek proposals in all areas of machine translation, LLMs applied to translation, computer-assisted translation technologies, spoken language translation and related topics.  
 The aim of a tutorial is primarily to help the audience to develop understanding of specific technical applied, and business matters related to research, development, and use of MT and translation technology.  
 Presentations of specific technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations.  
 We recommend that the tutorial covers work by the presenters as well as by other researchers. The submission should explain that this breadth is ensured. Tutorials should not be “self-invited talks”.  
 Tutorials are generally scheduled as half-day events (up to 3.5 hours, including coffee break).

  Short description of the target audience and any expected prerequisite background the audience should be aware of 
  An outline of the tutorial structure content and how it will be covered in a 3.5-hour slot (half-day). If you request a full-day slot it must be clearly motivated. 
  Diversity considerations, e.g. use of multilingual data, indications of how the described methods scale up to various languages or domains, participation of both senior and junior instructors, plans for how to diversify audience participation, etc. 
  Reading list. Work that you expect the audience to read before the tutorial can be indicated by an asterisk. The list should contain work by various authors (not just the tutorial organisers). Work from other disciplines is welcome if relevant. 
  For each tutorial presenter, a short description of their research interests and areas of expertise for the tutorial topic, as well as experience in instructing an international audience. 
  An estimate of the number of attendees. If this tutorial (or similar) has been given before, include information on previous edition (location, number of attendees, etc) 
  A description of special requirements for technical equipment. 
  Proposals should be submitted as PDF files to the EasyChair MT Summit 2025 page  (submission type: MT Summit 2025 Tutorials).  
 Submissions should be formatted according to the templates specified below  . Anonymisation is not required. Submissions should be no longer than 4 pages (excluding references). If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at mtsummit2025@unige.ch with the subject “Tutorial proposal”.  

 Evaluation Criteria   
 Each tutorial proposal will be evaluated according to its clarity and preparedness novelty or timely character of the topic, as well as instructors’ experience.  

 Tutorial Instructor Responsibilities   
 Accepted tutorial presenters will be notified by Friday, 13 December 2024. They must then provide abstracts of their tutorials for inclusion in the conference registration material by the specific conference deadlines. The description should be in two formats: (a) an ASCII version that can be included in email announcements and published on the conference website, and (b) a PDF version for inclusion in the electronic proceedings (detailed instructions will be provided).

 Authors must submit abstracts by February 3 and full papers by February 10. 
  Papers submitted to EC’25 must select one of four methodological tracks and several content areas. The list of tracks and content areas can be found below. 
  EC’25 is continuing the forward-to-journal option as in previous years. 
  EC’25 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event. 
   
 Policy for Accepted Papers  
 At least one author  of each accepted paper must attend and present the paper. We are willing to make exceptions in rare cases such as severe illness, visa denial, or a death in the family. If no author(s) will be able to attend, please write back to us (the General Chair, PC Chairs, and Virtual Chair) and explain the reason(s) for your absence. In approved instances, the authors will have the opportunity to present their work in the online preview week, either live or self-recorded. The presentation time will be as in the conference 18 minutes.  
 Background  
 Since 1999, the ACM Special Interest Group on Economics and Computation (SIGecom) has sponsored the leading scientific conference on advances in theory, empirics, and applications at the interface of economics and computation. The 26th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC’25) will feature invited speakers, a technical program of submitted paper presentations, workshops, and posters. EC’25 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event, taking place from July 7 through July 12, 2025 at Stanford University  .  
  We solicit paper submissions for presentation in the technical program.

 Submission Instructions  
 Submit a Paper   
 Identifiers.  Authors must submit abstracts by February 3 and full papers by February 10. The submission server will open mid-January.  
 Format.  The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long. The title page should only contain the title, submission number, and the abstract. In addition, an appendix of arbitrary length may be included at the end of the paper only for the review process (i.e., an appendix will not appear if the paper is published). This appendix will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. To add the submission number to the title page, one must first submit a paper without a number, see what number was assigned, and then revise the submission to include this number. The body of the submission should contain a clear presentation of the contributions of the paper, including a discussion of prior work and an outline of the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission as a whole should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the paper. Submitted papers will be evaluated on significance of the contribution, originality, relation to prior research, technical quality, and exposition.  
 LaTex style files.  Authors will be required to format their submissions using the EC’25 LaTex style files   , which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’25 LaTex style files or violate the page limit may be rejected without review.  
 Tracks.  Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions. The reviewing process of each track will be overseen by the corresponding Track Chair(s), who are primarily responsible for ensuring that consistent reviewing standards are applied to all papers in the same track. Authors should consider the description of the tracks to select which track best captures the research community according to whose standards their paper should be evaluated. Authors from any research community are welcome to submit to any of the tracks. EC’25 will use the following four tracks:  
 Theory: | Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly. | Track chairs: Nima Haghpanah, Annie Liang,  Ruta Mehta, Mallesh Pai, Grant Schoenebeck | . 
  Applied Modeling: | Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. | Track chairs: Nick Arnosti, Eduardo Azevedo, Sigal Oren | . 
  Empirics: | Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources or experiments. | Track chairs: Chiara Farronato, Denis Nekipelov | . 
  AI: | Typical papers in this track apply the methods and models of artificial intelligence, including both theoretical and computational approaches, to topics at the intersection of economics and computing. | Track chairs: Annie Liang, Grant Schoenebeck, Nisarg Shah | . 
  Areas.  Each submission must select at least one content area from the list provided below. Note that the areas are partially overlapping; if in doubt, authors are advised to select those area(s) that best fit their paper. Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Senior Program Committee (SPC) who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. SPCs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Track and Program Chairs.

  Alternative venues.  In addition, we will ask the authors to specify alternative venues to which they would consider submitting the paper. We understand that different communities have different ways of highlighting the contribution and will use this information to match papers to reviewers familiar with the appropriate context.  
 Review process.  Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees.  
  There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 27 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 17 after a second round of reviews. Between April 22-25, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.  
  The review process is double blind. Authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”).  
 Submission of code and data.  In the interest of reproducibility, authors are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data, if any. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.  
 One-page extended abstract option.  To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. Authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted electronically and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.  
 Submission of publicly available work (e.g., papers on arXiv).  (e.g., papers on arXiv). It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.  
 Simultaneous submissions to journals.  As in prior years, it is acceptable to simultaneously submit papers to EC’25 and to a journal, or to submit papers that are already under review at a journal, including papers that have already received a “revise and resubmit”, as long as the paper has not been accepted for publication prior to the EC submission deadline, and provided that the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in EC. Papers that are accepted at EC’25 and appear as a one-page abstract can subsequently be submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other archival conference (i.e., with published proceedings).  
 No other simultaneous submissions.  The following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’25 submission deadline, (c) papers in which one or more of the contributions have previously been published or accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference.  
 Highlights beyond EC.  Papers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’25 called “Highlights beyond EC”, which is intended to highlight some of the best work in economics and computation that has appeared elsewhere. The corresponding call for nominations will be announced soon.  
 Forward to journal:  As in prior years, authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice. The decision to select or decline this option will take place when authors are submitting the camera-ready version of the paper (or one-page abstract) for the conference proceedings and additional instructions for authors will be provided at that time. Our partner journals are:  
 ACM Transactions on Economics and Computatio | n 
  American Economic Journal: Microeconomics 
  Algorithmica 
  Econometrica | Notes: | A submission would require the standard submission fee. Authors should clearly state in the cover letter that the paper is a forward to journal from EC 25. This would allow editors to get access to the reviews. In addition, | authors should submit the paper together with a short revision plan, instead of the detailed response letter that is submitted to reviewers in a revision. The Editor in charge could then use any subset of the EC reviewers he/she would find useful. The short “revision plan” is intended to prevent authors from spending significant time responding to comments and then having the paper dismissed if the Editor in charge doesn’t think there’s a path forward. 
  Games and Economic Behavior 
  International Economic Review 
  International Journal of Game Theory 
  Journal of Political Economy 
  Management Science | , Market Design, Platform, and Demand Analytics area 
  Marketing Science 
  Mathematics of Operations Research | , Game Theory area | Notes: The journal is open to considering forward-to-journals to other areas, if the authors believe a different area is a better fit. Please contact the Editor. 
  Operations Research | , Markets, Platforms, and Revenue Management area | Notes: Please read carefully the conference to journal submission policy. | https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/opre/conference-to-journal-submission-policy | When utilizing the forward-to-journal from EC to Operations Research, adding a response document discussing the reviewer comments and whether/how they have been addressed is recommended. 
  Quantitative Marketing and Economics 
  RAND Journal of Economics 
  Review of Economic Studies 
  Social Choice and Welfare 
  TheoretiCS 
  Theoretical Economics 
  We emphasize that the ultimate disposition of the paper is within the editorial discretion of each journal; in particular, there is no guarantee of acceptance if the forward-to-journal option is chosen. However, we do anticipate that this process should result in a faster decision from the journal.  
  
 Feature at INFORMS.  Authors of accepted papers can indicate if they wish to be considered for presenting their papers in special sessions at the 2025 INFORMS Annual Meeting, organized and sponsored by the INFORMS Auctions and Market Design (AMD) Section. To be considered for this fast-track selection process conducted by the AMD cluster chairs, authors will need to provide a short non-technical abstract (at most 500 characters) and indicate whether the intended presenter is an INFORMS job market candidate. The exact deadline to submit this information will be announced soon.  
 Conflict of interest.  Authors will have the opportunity to declare conflicts of interest (COIs) with Program Committee members. This must be done separately for each submission. Declaring COIs prevents the specified people from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship. Instead, when declaring COIs, authors are asked to follow the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  . Program Committee members can also declare a conflict of interest with authors as well as with specific papers.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy  will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 Submission Instructions  
 Submit a Paper   
 Identifiers.  Authors must submit abstracts by February 3 and full papers by February 10. The submission server will open mid-January.  
 Format.  The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long. The title page should only contain the title, submission number, and the abstract. In addition, an appendix of arbitrary length may be included at the end of the paper only for the review process (i.e., an appendix will not appear if the paper is published). This appendix will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. To add the submission number to the title page, one must first submit a paper without a number, see what number was assigned, and then revise the submission to include this number. The body of the submission should contain a clear presentation of the contributions of the paper, including a discussion of prior work and an outline of the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission as a whole should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the paper. Submitted papers will be evaluated on significance of the contribution, originality, relation to prior research, technical quality, and exposition.  
 LaTex style files.  Authors will be required to format their submissions using the EC’25 LaTex style files   , which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’25 LaTex style files or violate the page limit may be rejected without review.  
 Tracks.  Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions. The reviewing process of each track will be overseen by the corresponding Track Chair(s), who are primarily responsible for ensuring that consistent reviewing standards are applied to all papers in the same track. Authors should consider the description of the tracks to select which track best captures the research community according to whose standards their paper should be evaluated. Authors from any research community are welcome to submit to any of the tracks. EC’25 will use the following four tracks:  
 Theory: | Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly. | Track chairs: Nima Haghpanah, Annie Liang,  Ruta Mehta, Mallesh Pai, Grant Schoenebeck | . 
  Applied Modeling: | Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. | Track chairs: Nick Arnosti, Eduardo Azevedo, Sigal Oren | . 
  Empirics: | Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources or experiments. | Track chairs: Chiara Farronato, Denis Nekipelov | . 
  AI: | Typical papers in this track apply the methods and models of artificial intelligence, including both theoretical and computational approaches, to topics at the intersection of economics and computing. | Track chairs: Annie Liang, Grant Schoenebeck, Nisarg Shah | . 
  Areas.  Each submission must select at least one content area from the list provided below. Note that the areas are partially overlapping; if in doubt, authors are advised to select those area(s) that best fit their paper. Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Senior Program Committee (SPC) who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. SPCs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Track and Program Chairs.

  Alternative venues.  In addition, we will ask the authors to specify alternative venues to which they would consider submitting the paper. We understand that different communities have different ways of highlighting the contribution and will use this information to match papers to reviewers familiar with the appropriate context.  
 Review process.  Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees.  
  There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 27 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 17 after a second round of reviews. Between April 22-25, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.  
  The review process is double blind. Authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”).  
 Submission of code and data.  In the interest of reproducibility, authors are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data, if any. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.  
 One-page extended abstract option.  To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. Authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted electronically and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.  
 Submission of publicly available work (e.g., papers on arXiv).  (e.g., papers on arXiv). It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.  
 Simultaneous submissions to journals.  As in prior years, it is acceptable to simultaneously submit papers to EC’25 and to a journal, or to submit papers that are already under review at a journal, including papers that have already received a “revise and resubmit”, as long as the paper has not been accepted for publication prior to the EC submission deadline, and provided that the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in EC. Papers that are accepted at EC’25 and appear as a one-page abstract can subsequently be submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other archival conference (i.e., with published proceedings).  
 No other simultaneous submissions.  The following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’25 submission deadline, (c) papers in which one or more of the contributions have previously been published or accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference.  
 Highlights beyond EC.  Papers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’25 called “Highlights beyond EC”, which is intended to highlight some of the best work in economics and computation that has appeared elsewhere. The corresponding call for nominations will be announced soon.  
 Forward to journal:  As in prior years, authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice. The decision to select or decline this option will take place when authors are submitting the camera-ready version of the paper (or one-page abstract) for the conference proceedings and additional instructions for authors will be provided at that time. Our partner journals are:  
 ACM Transactions on Economics and Computatio | n 
  American Economic Journal: Microeconomics 
  Algorithmica 
  Econometrica | Notes: | A submission would require the standard submission fee. Authors should clearly state in the cover letter that the paper is a forward to journal from EC 25. This would allow editors to get access to the reviews. In addition, | authors should submit the paper together with a short revision plan, instead of the detailed response letter that is submitted to reviewers in a revision. The Editor in charge could then use any subset of the EC reviewers he/she would find useful. The short “revision plan” is intended to prevent authors from spending significant time responding to comments and then having the paper dismissed if the Editor in charge doesn’t think there’s a path forward.

  We emphasize that the ultimate disposition of the paper is within the editorial discretion of each journal; in particular, there is no guarantee of acceptance if the forward-to-journal option is chosen. However, we do anticipate that this process should result in a faster decision from the journal.  
  
 Feature at INFORMS.  Authors of accepted papers can indicate if they wish to be considered for presenting their papers in special sessions at the 2025 INFORMS Annual Meeting, organized and sponsored by the INFORMS Auctions and Market Design (AMD) Section. To be considered for this fast-track selection process conducted by the AMD cluster chairs, authors will need to provide a short non-technical abstract (at most 500 characters) and indicate whether the intended presenter is an INFORMS job market candidate. The exact deadline to submit this information will be announced soon.  
 Conflict of interest.  Authors will have the opportunity to declare conflicts of interest (COIs) with Program Committee members. This must be done separately for each submission. Declaring COIs prevents the specified people from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship. Instead, when declaring COIs, authors are asked to follow the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  . Program Committee members can also declare a conflict of interest with authors as well as with specific papers.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy  will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 Submission Instructions  
 Submit a Paper   
 Identifiers.  Authors must submit abstracts by February 3 and full papers by February 10. The submission server will open mid-January.  
 Format.  The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long. The title page should only contain the title, submission number, and the abstract. In addition, an appendix of arbitrary length may be included at the end of the paper only for the review process (i.e., an appendix will not appear if the paper is published). This appendix will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. To add the submission number to the title page, one must first submit a paper without a number, see what number was assigned, and then revise the submission to include this number. The body of the submission should contain a clear presentation of the contributions of the paper, including a discussion of prior work and an outline of the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission as a whole should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the paper. Submitted papers will be evaluated on significance of the contribution, originality, relation to prior research, technical quality, and exposition.  
 LaTex style files.  Authors will be required to format their submissions using the EC’25 LaTex style files   , which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’25 LaTex style files or violate the page limit may be rejected without review.  
 Tracks.  Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions. The reviewing process of each track will be overseen by the corresponding Track Chair(s), who are primarily responsible for ensuring that consistent reviewing standards are applied to all papers in the same track. Authors should consider the description of the tracks to select which track best captures the research community according to whose standards their paper should be evaluated. Authors from any research community are welcome to submit to any of the tracks. EC’25 will use the following four tracks:  
 Theory: | Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly. | Track chairs: Nima Haghpanah, Annie Liang,  Ruta Mehta, Mallesh Pai, Grant Schoenebeck | . 
  Applied Modeling: | Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. | Track chairs: Nick Arnosti, Eduardo Azevedo, Sigal Oren | . 
  Empirics: | Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources or experiments. | Track chairs: Chiara Farronato, Denis Nekipelov | . 
  AI: | Typical papers in this track apply the methods and models of artificial intelligence, including both theoretical and computational approaches, to topics at the intersection of economics and computing. | Track chairs: Annie Liang, Grant Schoenebeck, Nisarg Shah | . 
  Areas.  Each submission must select at least one content area from the list provided below. Note that the areas are partially overlapping; if in doubt, authors are advised to select those area(s) that best fit their paper. Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Senior Program Committee (SPC) who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. SPCs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Track and Program Chairs.

  Algorithmic fairness and data privacy 
  Auctions and pricing 
  Behavioral economics and bounded rationality 
  Blockchain and cryptocurrencies

  Alternative venues.  In addition, we will ask the authors to specify alternative venues to which they would consider submitting the paper. We understand that different communities have different ways of highlighting the contribution and will use this information to match papers to reviewers familiar with the appropriate context.  
 Review process.  Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees.  
  There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 27 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 17 after a second round of reviews. Between April 22-25, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.  
  The review process is double blind. Authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”).  
 Submission of code and data.  In the interest of reproducibility, authors are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data, if any. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.  
 One-page extended abstract option.  To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. Authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted electronically and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.

 ECTEL 2024: Call for papers  
   
 Home 
  ECTEL 2024 

 Nineteenth European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning  
 Inclusive and equitable quality education for all  
 Krems, Austria, 16-20 September 2024  

 Call for Papers  
 The European Conference on Technology-Enhanced Learning (ECTEL) engages researchers, practitioners, educational developers, entrepreneurs, industry leaders and policy makers to address current challenges and advances in the field. ECTEL 2024 will take place face-to-face on 16-20 September 2024 in Krems, Austria, with the theme What is the role of TEL to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all?    

 Theme  
 In a world undergoing rapid transformation due to technological advancements (e.g., Generative Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, and Connectivity Technologies), the education landscape is also expanding with new possibilities. However, these advancements bring complex challenges, including effective adoption of technology in educational settings, ethical concerns, and the possible digital divide these technologies could create. Therefore, the theme for the 2024 conference aims to investigate the role of Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) in achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal for education: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”  
 This year’s conference explores the role of TEL within this critical context. We invite submissions that enhance our comprehension of how TEL can promote an equitable, high-quality education for all. Topics of interest include but are not limited to strategies for strengthening digital/AI literacy, facilitating lifelong learning, improving accessibility, and mitigating the digital divide issue. We are interested in papers that not only explore the adoption of emerging technologies for enhancing the educational experience but also explore the limitations of these technologies and undertake investigations in different learning environments and cross-cultural settings. In alignment with the focus on sustainability in past ECTEL conferences, we also welcome papers that offer insights into the scalable and sustainable deployment of these technologies.  
 The topics of interest are grouped into seven blocks. The detailed list of topics of interest for the conference can be found here  .  
 Pedagogical and theoretical underpinning of educational technologies 
  Technologies used for learning 
  Individual, social, and organisational learning processes 
  Ethics, privacy, regulations and policies 
  Learning communities and contexts 
  Global teaching and learning 
  Quality education for underrepresented groups 
  We invite submissions through research papers, demonstrations, posters  , and workshops  . In addition, a doctoral consortium  will be organised to run concurrently with the workshops, offering a platform for doctoral candidates to present and discuss their research.  

 Submission Formats  
 Research papers (8-15 pages, including references)  
 No matter the length, research papers are expected to be mature research contributions to the field of technology-enhanced learning. Research papers should clearly define research objectives and questions that fit within the scope of the conference and its topics. In addition, research papers should discuss the state-of-the-art in the area in which the work is framed, how the new proposal advances state of the art, present an appropriate research methodology, as well as present and discuss the results of the research conducted. Preliminary results or work in progress fit very well in the poster paper category. Research papers should highlight their novelty and contribution to the field. It is important for ECTEL 2024 research papers to consider both technology and learning.  
 Accepted research papers will be published in LNCS Springer Conference Proceedings.  

 Poster papers (4-6 pages, including references)  
 Poster Papers report on significant work-in-progress research and developments that fit within the scope of the conference and its topics. Theoretical and practice-oriented contributions are welcomed. The submission should include theoretical background, a description of the work, preliminary results, and references.  
 Accepted poster papers will be published in LNCS Springer Conference Proceedings.  

 Demonstration papers (4-6 pages, including references)  
 Demonstration papers are expected to describe innovative TEL applications, practices and prototypes aligned with the conference theme and topics (e.g. dashboards, recommender systems, chatbots, practice-oriented contributions, etc.). The submission should include pedagogical and technological background, a description of the application/practice/prototype/use case to demonstrate its relevance, results and outcomes achieved, future agenda and/or next steps.   
 Accepted demonstration papers will be published in LNCS Springer Conference Proceedings.  

 Workshop proposals  
 Workshops provide a venue for community building and idea generation for emerging research topics to groups of like-minded researchers and practitioners, further elaborating on how learning technologies can add educational value to the different stakeholders and contribute to effective education.  
 Workshop proposals will not be published in the conference proceedings.  
 Workshops Organisers interested in coordinating a workshop are welcome to submit a proposal by filling out a form available on this page  .  

 Doctoral Consortium (5-10 pages, including references)  
 The Doctoral Consortium is an exceptional opportunity for PhD candidates to present, discuss, and receive feedback on their research in an interdisciplinary and international atmosphere. Prominent professors and researchers in the field of Technology-Enhanced Learning will provide formative feedback to the selected papers through the review process and contribute actively to discussions at the workshop.  
    
 The submissions will be submitted for publication in CEUR Workshops Proceedings  .   
 More information on preparing the submission and application procedures will be made available early next year.

 Submission Guidelines  
 Double-blind Review  
 All papers submitted to ECTEL, except Doctoral Consortium submissions, will be reviewed through a double-blind review process, meaning that author names are not disclosed to the reviewers and reviewer names are not disclosed to the authors.   
 For this purpose, authors must submit their manuscript:   
 without any reference to themselves and their institutions; 
  without any URLs to projects, products or self-developed systems; 
  with relevant self-references blinded or written in the third person. 

 Preparing Your Submission  
 Research, poster and demonstration paper  authors must consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines,  and follow Springer policies on publication  (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process).  
 The use of the supplied template is mandatory in the preparation of their papers:  
 LaTeX template | (also available on | Overleaf | ) 
  Microsoft Word template | ( | Microsoft Word 2003 | ) 
  Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs  in their papers.  
 Before submission, please make sure that the paper does not exceed the allocated number of pages and does not include appendices.  
 Upload your submission to ECTEL 2024 EasyChair submission system  before the official deadline ( 29 March 2024, 23:59 UTC-12). Abstracts are due 15 March 2024.   
  
 Please note that:  
 Workshop proposals | will be handled separately, and submissions will be made using another system specified on this page  . 
  Doctoral Consortium submissions | should follow the instructions that will be published at a later date. 

 Proceedings Publication  
 Accepted research, poster and demo papers will be published in the conference proceedings. Like every year, the proceedings will be published within Springer “Lecture Notes in Computer Science” (LNCS) Series  .  
 Please note that at least one of the authors of each accepted submission must register for the conference by the camera-ready deadline for the paper to be included in the proceedings.   
 If you are interested in publishing your paper Open Access, please contact us and refer to Springer’s LNCS webpage  for prices and additional information. The authors or their institutions must cover costs for the OA publication. The invoicing address and the CC-BY licence-to-publish agreement must be submitted to Springer by the deadline for the camera-ready version.  
 Workshop proposals and workshop contributions will not be included in the conference proceedings. Workshop organisers who wish to publish workshop contributions or outcomes are expected to manage the process independently.  
 Doctoral Consortium papers will be published in CEUR Workshop Proceedings ( CEUR-WS  ).  

 Statement on Open Science  
 As in previous years, we want to encourage Open Science within the EATEL research community. We therefore encourage authors to document their research in a reproducible and verifiable manner, and in general to use Open Science best practices. Two best practices that we specifically would be happy to see in ECTEL 2024 research papers are:   
 Pre-registration. Results from empirical studies are more robust when researchers predefine a research and analysis plan and register it before data collection. To do so, we encourage authors to use services like | AsPredicted | and the | Open Science Framework | to preregister their research so that confirmatory and exploratory analyses can be better evaluated. The research manuscript should then include a link to the preregistration repository. 
  Sharing data and code for replication purposes. Sharing data sources (always anonymised!) as well as the scripts or programs you used to analyse them can help other researchers to reproduce, replicate or extend your analysis. We encourage authors to share this information by providing a link to the data and code in the manuscript. 

 Invitation to publish in a Special Issue for the Journal of Computer Assisted Learning or IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies  
 Best paper nominations and additional selected papers will be invited to submit an extended article to a Special Issue dedicated to ECTEL 2024 in Wiley’s Journal of Computer Assisted Learning  or as a regular submission to IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies  . The extended articles need to have 30% new content and contain design-relevant knowledge as envisioned by each journal.  
 The extended papers submitted to either of the two venues will undergo a new review process and acceptance is not guaranteed.

         - A DAY IN BOLOGNA   - TOURIST INFORMATION           - A DAY IN BOLOGNA   - TOURIST INFORMATION        

 We are honoured and delighted to invite you  
  to the historic city of Bologna  for the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence  ,  
  which will take place on October 25-30, 2025  .  

   BASIC INFORMATION  

 VENUE   
 Bologna (Italy)   

 DATE   
 October 25-30, 2025   

 INTRODUCTION  

 In Bologna you will find the most ancient University of the world  , founded in 1088, and nowadays ranked amongst the most important and influencing European academic institutions.  
 In this charming medieval city you will also find a thriving scientific environment  , where research on AI is conducted side by side to public bodies (CINECA Consortium hosts the largest Italian computing center for Big Data; the EU chose the data center of the European Center for Weather Forecast), and to the private initiative (the region has the largest number of startup companies per inhabitant in Italy).  
 Many researchers are already exploiting AI to solve a plethora of sustainability-related issues.  
 We strongly believe that AI will be the key to also understand the sustainability theme in a holistic manner, helping us to reach some awareness over the complexities of our planet, our ecosystems, and our societies.  
 The conference will be supported by the European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI)  and the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence (AIxIA)  .  
 We are eager to meet you in Bologna, to know your ideas and views over AI, to share knowledge and to enjoy together some unforgettable moments.

It has been renamed as the 25 th  EAAAI 2024 ( Engineering Applications and Advances of Artificial Intelligence  ) in order to cover a wider spectrum of AI research areas and domains. On behalf of the EAAAI organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. EAAAI (ex EANN) aims to provide a forum for all scientists from both academia and industry who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects.  
 The conference accepts papers from the whole AI spectrum and from every application scientific domain   .  
 The EAAAI ex EANN conference has been held continuously since 1995, under the auspices of the INNS EANN Special Interest Group  . Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the INNS community.

 Media Literacy    
 Putting media literacy on the map: findings from a European research study  
 2 days ago    
 4 min read   

 by Laurie Day  , Ecorys, UK.  
 A growing awareness of the risks presented by misinformation and the rise of Generative AI have combined to fuel public and professional interest in media literacy. This spotlight on the media sector presents both challenges and opportunities. A new study published this week explores how European countries are responding, and presents recommendations for action.  
 Media literacy in a fast evolving ecosystem   
 There is no doubt that media literacy is riding high on the policy agenda, with additional EU funding for programmatic work  and thriving communities of practice. The recent publication of the EDMO Guidelines for Effective Media Literacy Initiatives  provides an important milestone, bringing diverse stakeholders together to achieve consensus on what good quality and inclusive media literacy initiatives can and should look like in a European context.  
 At the same time, the sector faces thorny issues that have yet to be resolved: how to move beyond initiatives focussed on individual media competences to address structural and societal factors mediating collective media behaviours; how to engage and meet the needs of underserved populations  , and how to build effective and sustainable cross-sectoral approaches  towards media literacy, while navigating a complex regulatory landscape.  
   Situating the research   
 Published this week, the final reports from an EU Media Literacy Policy Study  explore these issues in further depth and provide a snapshot of policies and practices on media literacy in eight European countries. The research was designed and carried out by Ecorys with expert advice from the LSE Department of Media and Communications and funded by Google.  
 The study aimed to provide:  
 An overview of the state-of-the-sector for media literacy policies and practices in Europe. 
  An assessment of the implications of emerging technologies, including Generative AI, for tackling misinformation and developing critical thinking skills. 
  Recommendations to inform the evolving agenda for collaboration on media literacy across industry, public sector and civil society in Europe. 
  The work took place between September 2023 and July 2024, and was based on a mixed methods design, combining primary and secondary data collection and analysis with deliberative stakeholder workshops conduced with key stakeholders across Europe.  
 Cross-sectoral approaches in action   
 The findings reflect the scale and complexity of the challenges presented for citizens to develop and maintain critical thinking skills across the life course, and the positioning of media literacy education within school curricula specifically. The reports showcase what has been done in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK), providing policy and practice insights, and highlighting examples of promising practices.  
     
 The research also turns the spotlight on platform-based media literacy initiatives, providing a learning review of Google’s media literacy work in Europe. It highlights the essential role of funding for organisations leveraging media literacy at a national and local level, and the importance of building civil society capacity  to respond to emerging media literacy priorities; investing in AI literacy  and making effective use of in-product fact checking tools.  
 The study calls for investment in broad-based media literacy strategies that serve the needs of Europe’s diverse citizens, for a reprioritisation of media literacy within lifelong learning policies, and smarter and more consistent approaches to define and evidence the outcomes from pilot programmes and initiatives.  
 It also challenges Google and other tech companies to go beyond the EU Code of Practice, taking further action on algorithmic transparency and widening access to data from very large online platforms (VLOPs) for academic research as part of an ecosystem-wide approach.  
 Further information   
 The study outputs, including the EU mapping and case study report, the review of Google’s media literacy programmes in Europe, and a set of policy briefs, are available at:  
 https://www.ecorys.com/MediaLiteracyEducation   
 The study team will be hosting a webinar to share the learning from the reports: Putting media literacy on the map: directions for Europe  , which is taking place on Thursday 16th January 2025  , from 14:00-15:00 CET. pre-register at the link below to express your interest:

 ECAI, the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, is Europe’s premier AI research venue. We are pleased to host the 27th edition of this conference in person, in Santiago de Compostela, a city which has been for centuries the destination of pilgrims and travellers from all over Europe. ECAI-2024 will feature, as usual, a full programme of technical papers, as well as many AI-related events of interest to researchers, students and industry professionals. This includes workshops and tutorials, invited talks, special sessions, as well as ECAI’s sister conference on AI applications (PAIS).  
 The conference is organised by the European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI) and the Spanish Artificial Intelligence Society (AEPIA) and it is hosted by CiTIUS, the Research Centre on Intelligent Technologies of the University of Santiago de Compostela.  
 Although the first conference to be labelled “European Conference on AI” was ECAI-1982 held in Orsay near Paris, the European AI community has traditionally considered the first four biennial Conferences on Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (Brighton 1974, Edinburgh 1976, Hamburg 1978 and Amsterdam 1980) as “European Conferences on AI.” This is why we celebrate in 2024 in Santiago de Compostela, with the 27th ECAI, 50 years of European Conferences on AI and this is the motivation for ECAI 2024 motto: "Celebrating the past. Inspiring the future"  .  
 To find out more about the history of ECAI, please visit the EurAI website.   

 ORGANISED BY  
   
 The conference is organised by the European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI)  and the Spanish AI Society (AEPIA)  , and hosted by the Intelligent Systems Group  and the CiTIUS-Research Centre on Intelligent Technologies of the University of Santiago de Compostela  .

 ECAI 2024  
 50 YEARS BUILDING THE FUTURE WITH AI  
   
 Santiago de Compostela, declared a World Heritage City by UNESCO in 1985, has been for centuries the final destination for people all over Europe through the historical Routes to Santiago de Compostela.  
 The city was elected to host ECAI’s 2020 edition, which finally went online because of the COVID pandemic. Despite such extraordinary circumstances, Digital ECAI2020 was a huge success, with more than 5,000 attendees online. Because of this, EurAI decided that Santiago would host the 2024 edition as well.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.  
 - top -   
   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.   
    
 - top -   
   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

 Research and Development for Artificial Intelligence   

 We can perform numerous research and development activities that support the growth and development of organizations in the modern age while helping them develop an r&d strategic plan. Our AI team has proven research skills and an extensive academic background across multiple disciplines. No matter what area of research you need help with, we have the skills necessary to put your ideas into action.  

 What Can You  Do With It?  

 State Of The Art Review   
 We can conduct extensive and in-depth data reviews. Whether you deal with scientific data, academic literature, business data, or third-party research data, we can go through anything. Later, you can use this reviewed data with the highest confidence in your research and development projects.  

 Original Scientific Research   
 AI is becoming more and more prevalent in scientific research. This branch employs data mining, visualization, analysis, statistics, machine learning, and more. AI can help researchers validate existing hypotheses or come up with new ones. Additionally, artificial intelligence can function as a research assistant by extracting data, conducting post-market surveillance, and reviewing the literature.  

 Implementation of Published Papers   
 Published papers are a crucial part of any scientific research, but implementing their findings can be challenging. By default, many scientific papers are long and detailed. You may not need all of the data outlined in the paper. In some case, you will only want to focus only on the most relevant ones, like algorithms.  
   
  AI can help you extract only the information you need. You can use AI to build a stack of relevant papers that you can extract significant information from to support your research.  

 Develop Concepts and Materialize Ideas   
 AI and machine learning excel at solving problems. If you have ai research and development projects that are stuck, AI can help you develop ideas and concepts. You can find patterns in your data to create new focus areas and bring your ideas to life.

 Call for Papers  
   
 We invite all members of the international AI research community to submit their best work to the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024), to be held in the beautiful city of Santiago de Compostela during 19-24 October 2024. Join us to mark the 50th birthday since the first AI conference was held in Europe back in 1974.  
 We welcome submissions on all aspects of AI. Submissions will be subject to double-blind peer review by the programme committee. They will be evaluated based on relevance, clarity, significance, originality, soundness, reproducibility, scholarship, and quality of presentation.  
 The conference is planned as an in-person event. Each accepted paper will get assigned either an oral presentation slot or a combined poster/spotlight presentation slot. The presentation modality is not intended to reflect perceived scientific quality of the paper, so this assignment will be made in a randomised fashion (subject to programme constraints).  
 The open-access proceedings will be published by IOS Press  . A selection of the best papers submitted to the conference will be invited for fast-track consideration by the Artificial Intelligence Journal or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.

 ECAI LaTeX Template   Excessive use of typesetting tricks to make things fit is not permitted. Please do not modify the style files or layout parameters.  
 Registering an abstract of your paper (of around 100-300 words in plain text) is required in advance of the paper submission deadline and you will be asked to provide additional information (such as keywords) at that time. Please do not leave things to the very last moment; you can resubmit any number of times until the submission deadline.  
 ECAI EasyChair Site     

 Ethics Statement  
   
 Research reported at ECAI should avoid harm, be honest and trustworthy, fair and non-discriminatory, and respect privacy and intellectual property.  
 Where relevant, authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference page, a short ethics statement that addresses ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work.  
 Reviewers will be asked to flag possible violations of relevant ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by a senior member of the programme committee. Authors may be required to revise their paper to include a discussion of possible ethical concerns and their mitigation.  

 Supplementary Material  
   
 You have the option to accompany your submission with supplementary material, such as a technical appendix or code and data (up to 50MB).  
 Reviewers will consult supplementary material at their own discretion, and you should not assume that they necessarily will. Make sure that any supplementary material you submit really is supplementary in nature: any information that is essential for understanding or evaluating your paper must be included in the paper itself. You of course must ensure that your supplementary material does not compromise the anonymity of your submission.  
 We will not publish your supplementary material. Nevertheless, if your paper gets accepted, then the readers of your published paper should have access to the same information as the reviewers of your submission. So you should make your (suitably revised) supplementary material openly available in archival form at the time of publication of your paper, and you should include a reference to the supplementary material in the camera-ready copy of your paper. For code or data you may wish to use a service such as Zenodo  . For a technical appendix you may wish to use an archival preprint server such as arXiv  .  

 Resubmission from Other Conferences  
   
 If an earlier version of your paper was rejected from another conference with archival proceedings and double-blind reviewing during the 12 months preceding the submission deadline (such as ECAI-2023, AAAI-2024, or IJCAI-2024), you can supplement your submission with a document detailing how you have taken the reviews received into account to improve your paper.  
 This document must be a single PDF consisting of the following three parts:  
 A cover letter, of at most one page, in which you summarise your response to the reviews received and how you have changed your paper since then. 
  All reviews, including the metareview (if any), in anonymised form (but otherwise unedited). A screenshot from the submission system will usually work best. 
  An unedited copy of the earlier submission. 
  This is entirely voluntary. Do it if you feel it would help reviewers to better appreciate your work. You can include documentation for at most one conference. The document you provide will be shared with your reviewers at the start of the reviewing process.  

 Policies  
   
 ECAI subscribes to the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity  . By submitting to ECAI you confirm that you are aware of and accept the following specific policies:  
 Originality:  Submissions must not have substantial overlap in either contribution or text with work previously accepted for publication as a full paper in another archival forum. Papers at workshops without archival proceedings and preprints are fine. 
  Concurrent submission:  We recognise the significant strain on the scientific community caused by the needs of peer review. Therefore, the work you submit must not be under review elsewhere at any time between submission and notification. 
  Anonymity:  Reviewing for ECAI is double-blind, meaning that reviewers should not be aware of the identity of the authors of the papers they review. As an author you must make a reasonable effort to ensure that this is possible. Specifically, use the “doubleblind” option of the LaTeX template and do not include any acknowledgements in your submission. Cite your own prior work where appropriate, but do so in the third rather than the first person (that is, write, for instance, “Turing et al. [42] have shown …” rather than “We have shown … [42]”). 
  Links:  Papers must not include pointers to supplementary material on the web, not even when that supplementary material has been fully anonymised, as we would be unable to ensure that it remains unaltered throughout the reviewing period. 
  Social media:  Actively promoting a paper on social media channels while it is undergoing double-blind review is discouraged. 
  Reproducibility:  Reviewers will be instructed to pay close attention to reproducibility of results where appropriate and you should submit relevant code and data as supplementary material whenever feasible. 
  Information sharing:  Submissions will be treated confidentially. However, papers, author information, and reviews may be shared with the organisers of other AI conferences to identify duplicate submissions and to limit duplicate reviewing efforts. 
  Abstracts:  Abstracts are central for the assignment of reviewers. Therefore, they must not be altered in any significant way after the abstract submission deadline. In particular, submitting “placeholder abstracts” is not admissible. 
  Authorship:  All individuals, and only those, who have made significant contributions to a paper should be listed as authors in the submission system. We will not permit adding or removing authors to a paper after the submission deadline. Please also ensure that the order of authors is correct at submission time. 
  Submission limit:  No individual may be listed as an author for more than 8 separate submissions to ECAI. 
  Generative AI:  The use of AI systems to generate text for inclusion in an ECAI submission is only allowed if its role is properly documented in the manuscript (e.g., when reporting on experiments on such systems). However, the use of AI-powered systems to assist with the polishing of human-authored text is permissible. 
  Purchasing extra pages:  Authors of accepted papers may purchase up to two extra pages in the proceedings, for EUR 250 per page. This is not intended to be used to add significant material that has not been reviewed but to allow authors to account for reviewer suggestions. The extra income generated in this manner will get channelled back into the community through travel grants and the like. 
  Attendance:  At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early registration deadline with the intention of presenting the paper at the conference. This is a prerequisite for inclusion in the proceedings. 
  Reviewing:  Authors may be called upon to help with reviewing papers for ECAI. This does not apply to individuals who already are serving on the PC or who are not yet qualified to serve on the PC (such as students). Waivers will be granted in exceptional circumstances (such as parental leave).

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

 *You are encouraged to submit to one of the other thematic areas. If you feel your contribution is at the intersection of many fields, please pick one. If you still want to submit to this area, you will be asked to explain why. Please note that the submissions in this area and others are likely to be moved, subject to chairs’ considerations.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.  
 - top -   
   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.   
    
 - top -   
   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

 Proceedings Chairs  :

  Tijana Milenkovic  , University of Notre Dame, USA  
   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.

   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.

   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.

   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

 News and FAQ | The EURO  Working Group on Combinatorial Optimization, ECCO  (European Chapter on Combinatorial Optimization) provides an excellent opportunity to discuss recent and important issues in Combinatorial Optimization and its applications with European combinatorialists; most European countries are represented. Purpose and history  
 The group was created in 1987 by C. Roucairol, D. de Werra and A. Rinnooy Kan. C. Roucairol chaired for the first 10 years and now it's chaired by S. Martello  . This group provides an excellent opportunity to discuss recent and important issues in Combinatorial Optimization and its applications with European combinatorialists; most European countries are represented. The groupe is suitable for people who are presently engaged in Combinatorial Optimization (CO), either in theoritical aspects or in business, industry or public administration applications ... All the fields are taken in consideration: operations management - logistics, production scheduling location and distribution problem, ressource allocation, flexible manufacturing ..., - engineering, VLSI design and computer design, network design, ... Recent sessions in last ECCOs have attached a particular emphasis to metaheuristics or new local search methods (tabu, genetic algorithm, ...), polyhedra approaches to difficult problems, recent developments in classical optimization problems (scheduling, assignmentn knapsack partitioning, ...).  
 The meetings are held on a regular basis (once a year during Spring) and nicely combine scientific work and the exchange of new ideas with an exciting atmosphere, as in Paris, May 1988; Venice June 1989; Barcelona, May 1990; Dubrovnik, May 1991 (canceled); Graz April 1992; Brussels, April 1993; Milan, February 1994; Poznan, May 1995; Dublin, April 1996; Tenerife, May 1997; Copenhagen, May 1998; Bendor May 1999; Capri, May 2000; Bonn, May 2001; Lugano, May-June 2002; Molde June 2003; Beirut, June 2004; Minsk, May 2005; Porto (joinlty with CO), May 2006; Cyprus, May 2007; Dubrovnik, May 2008; Jerusalem, May 2009; Malaga (joinlty with CO), May 2010; Amsterdam, May-June 2011; Antalya, April 2012; Paris, May-June 2013; Munich (joinlty with CO), May 2014; Catania, May 2015; Budapest, May 2016; Koper, May 2017; Fribourg (joinlty with CO), June 2018; St. Julian in Malta, May-June 2019; St. Peterburg, June 2020 (canceled); Madrid@online, June 2021; @online (joinlty with CO), June 2022; Chania in Crete, May 2023.  
 ECCO XXXVII - 2024  conference will be organized and hosted by KU Leuven-Gent in Ghent, Belgium.  
  It is scheduled for June 06-08, 2024.   
   
 An abstract booklet is distributed to the participants at each meeting.

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.

   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.

 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference is vital for its role in uniting computer science, biology, and bioinformatics. It accelerates discovery by leveraging intelligent systems to analyze complex molecular data, enabling precision medicine and revolutionizing drug discovery. ISMB addresses big data challenges, educates researchers, and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, making it a critical hub for advancing life science research and applications.  
 ISMB is the flagship meeting of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) and has become the leading global conference in the field. 2025 marks the 33rd year of ISMB and is combined with the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB), which is in its 24th year. The ISMB/ECCB conference series aims at attracting the top research contributions in all areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. Typical, but not exclusive, the topics of interest are: sequence analysis, evolution and phylogeny, comparative genomics, protein structure, molecular and supramolecular dynamics, molecular evolution, gene regulation and transcriptomics, proteomics, Systems biology, ontologies, databases and data integration, text mining and information extraction, and human health. The conference also aims to attract participants from related disciplines in order to understand the need that exists for computational approaches in related fields, and to gain from approaches taken in other disciplines that might be appropriate for computational biology.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.

   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.   
    
 - top -   
   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

 The conference is organized by the IFIP 8.5 WG in Information Systems in Public Administration  
  August 31 – September 4, 2025  
 University for Continuing Education Krems,  Austria   
  The IFIP EGOV 2025   is a scientific conference that is dedicated to the broader areas of e-Government and e-Democracy, which include facets like Digital Government, e-Participation, Open Government, Smart Government, AI government, GovTech, Algoritmic Governance, and related topics to digitalization and government.    
 The conference represents the merge of the IFIP WG 8.5 Electronic Government (EGOV), the IFIP WG 8.5 IFIP Electronic Participation (ePart) and the Conference for E-Democracy and Open Government Conference (CeDEM).    
 Several different types of submissions can be made, such as completed research, but also ongoing research, reflections & viewpoints, posters, workshops. The conference organizes a PhD Colloquium and offers a limited number of PhD bursaries. The day prior to the main conference, there is also a Junior Faculty School for PhD students, postdocs, and junior faculty.    
 We invite individuals from academic and applied backgrounds as well as from business, public authorities, NGOs, NPOs and education institutions to submit their research papers, reflections, posters as well as practitioner papers, panel or workshop proposals to the topics addressed in the tracks.

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference is vital for its role in uniting computer science, biology, and bioinformatics. It accelerates discovery by leveraging intelligent systems to analyze complex molecular data, enabling precision medicine and revolutionizing drug discovery. ISMB addresses big data challenges, educates researchers, and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, making it a critical hub for advancing life science research and applications.  
 ISMB is the flagship meeting of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) and has become the leading global conference in the field. 2025 marks the 33rd year of ISMB and is combined with the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB), which is in its 24th year. The ISMB/ECCB conference series aims at attracting the top research contributions in all areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. Typical, but not exclusive, the topics of interest are: sequence analysis, evolution and phylogeny, comparative genomics, protein structure, molecular and supramolecular dynamics, molecular evolution, gene regulation and transcriptomics, proteomics, Systems biology, ontologies, databases and data integration, text mining and information extraction, and human health. The conference also aims to attract participants from related disciplines in order to understand the need that exists for computational approaches in related fields, and to gain from approaches taken in other disciplines that might be appropriate for computational biology.  
 - top -   
  Scientific Programme  
 ISMB is conducted over a five-day period. The heart of our scientific programme is the ISCB Communities of Special Interest (COSIs)  . Participants can look forward to a rich programme that includes:  
 Training workshops and tutorials: Sessions designed to enhance participants' knowledge and skills in specific bioinformatics and computational biology areas. 
  Student Council Symposium: A dedicated symposium where students can showcase their research and interact with peers and experts. 
  Youth Bioinformatics Symposium: A dedicated symposium for middle and high school students to learn more about computational biology and bioinformatics and exciting opportunities within those disciplines. 
  Live and on-demand sessions: Talks and presentations accessible live and available for on-demand viewing, accommodating attendees from different time zones. 
  Scientific talks: Over 500 scientific talks on various topics within bioinformatics and computational biology. 
  Face-to-face networking events: Opportunities for in-person attendees to connect, collaborate, and network. 
  Virtual attendee profile and matchmaker features: Tools to facilitate networking and making new connections within the virtual platform. 
  One-on-one meetings: Opportunities to schedule private meetings with speakers, presenters, exhibitors, and sponsors to learn more about their work. 
  Access to on-demand repository: Exclusive access to recorded talks and poster presentations for viewing after the conference.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

 *You are encouraged to submit to one of the other thematic areas. If you feel your contribution is at the intersection of many fields, please pick one. If you still want to submit to this area, you will be asked to explain why. Please note that the submissions in this area and others are likely to be moved, subject to chairs’ considerations.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.  
 - top -   
   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.   
    
 - top -   
   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org

   Proceedings Key Dates

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.  
 - top -   
   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.   
    
 - top -   
   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

   Proceedings Overview  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 invites submissions of full papers (not abstracts) consisting of new, unpublished work, reporting theoretical, computational, and statistical advances in computational biology and its intersections with other fields.  
 Submissions are encouraged to report on advances in algorithm development and optimization, data structures, data visualization, artificial intelligence/machine learning, text mining, statistical inference, database and ontology development, image analysis, citizen and open science, etc  . to analyze all types of biological data.  
 While we encourage submissions in new and emerging areas, we expect that the majority of submissions addressing topical biological domains will fall into one of the areas below. Please note during the EasyChair submission process you will: 1) select your "Area" (list below) and 2) select one or more of the Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) best suited for the presentation of your research from within the area. (learn more about COSIs here  ).   
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 14, 2025. You will be asked during your confirmation of participation to confirm your in-person participation.  If unable  to participate you will need to request a waiver by writing presentationwaiver@iscb.org     
    
  Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ( https://www.iscb.org/iscb-pol  icy-statements/iscb-policy-for  -acceptable-use-of-large-langu  age-models  )  
 - top -   
   Proceedings Publication Fee  
 Authors of accepted Proceedings papers are responsible for the publication fee of $700 USD.  This is a substantial reduction from the publication fees customary for OUP journals. ISCB is committed to supporting all of its members, especially those from under-developed nations and/or those without funding. If your manuscript is accepted and you are unable to pay for the publication fees in part or in full, you may submit a fee waiver request to waiver@iscb.org   . Please provide your name, full institute address, and a short (up to 50 words) justification of why you are unable to cover the publication fee with the subject line of ISMB 2024 Publications Fee Waiver Request.  
 Publication fee payments are due by May 1, 2025. The online proceedings payment system will open April 9, 2025.  
 Proceedings publications are part of an online-only special issue of Bioinformatics  and are open access (CC-BY), fully citable, and indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.

   Review Process  
 Submissions will be subject to two rounds of reviews, allowing the authors to reply to the reviewer comments. In the first round the submissions will be classified into three categories: (a) accept/minor changes, (b) major changes, and (c) not accepted. Papers in the first category will be considered “conditionally" accepted without a second round of full review; Area Chairs would review the final version and in some cases ask the reviewers if concerns, if any, have been addressed.  Authors of submissions in the second category will be given the opportunity to submit revised drafts based on the reviewer comments, with letters of response to the reviewers outlining the main changes and/or giving counter arguments to the reviewer points.  
   
  We expect the majority of papers to fall in categories (a) and (c), with category (b) reserved for papers that the reviewers identified as strong but with substantial issues that need to be addressed. Among the resubmitted papers, the second round of review will select the most suitable papers for presentation. All reviews of submitted papers are considered confidential and details are not disclosed outside of the review process. These will be published in the Bioinformatics journal and presented at the conference. All accepted papers are expected to have source code available and linked in the manuscript to ensure reproducibility of results.   
 - top -    
   Transfers to Bioinformatics Advances   
 Getting your paper accepted to the ISMB Proceedings is very competitive. For papers which are ranked highly but are not accepted we will be making offers to transfer some manuscripts to the ISCB journal Bioinformatics Advances  . Manuscripts and the associated ISMB reviews would only be transferred to the journal upon author agreement. By transferring the reviews rapid decisions can be made by the journal. Papers accepted to Bioinformatics Advances  would NOT be a part of the ISMB/ECCB 2025 Proceedings and would NOT be offered a talk. Please also note that Bioinformatics Advances is fully open access and that the normal Open Access Charges  for the journal would apply.  
 Authors may opt out of this transfer process at submission time.

   Submission Guidelines  
 All submission MUST  select a presenting author.   The presenting author MUST  be marked as a corresponding author.   Papers can be submitted in either a template-free format or by following the template for author submission to the OUP journal Bioinformatics  . You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. You are encouraged to submit in the OUP format. If the OUP template is used, the paper length must not exceed nine pages. If the template-free format is used the length of the paper must not exceed 12 pages (single space, 12 point font). In either  format  the page count should include any required abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography.   Papers must be submitted as a PDF. If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements. In either case, the paper must contain an abstract whose length does not exceed 250 words.  
 Authors of submissions will need to select 1st choice and 2nd choice areas  most suitable for their paper (this is relevant for which Area Chairs/reviewers will review the paper). During submission, authors will be able to identify up to three COSIs  most relevant to the topic of their submission (this is relevant for which COSI, i.e. conference track, the talk will be presented at if the paper is accepted). During the review process three reviews will be sought. Papers may be moved between areas as appropriate - this is often necessary for load balance and fit between areas during the review process.  
 If absolutely necessary, submissions can be accompanied by supplementary material, similar to submissions to scientific journals. The supplementary material should be collected in a separate file that is appropriately marked and uploaded as an attachment on the paper submission page in EasyChair. However, we advise against adding supplementary material, in general. Supplementary material will be published on the proceedings site alongside the online version of the conference paper. We do not support supplementary material presented at any other than the publisher's site. Additionally, OUP does not edit or typeset supplementary data - it is uploaded online exactly as it is received, so authors must ensure its accuracy before submitting.  
 Papers should be submitted in their final form since the evaluation procedure does not allow for additional rounds of refinement / modification in response to referee criticisms. Poor quality submissions or insufficiently prepared papers are very often rejected. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 ISMB does not accept previously published works  through peer-reviewed publications. Please note that conference presentations, posting on recognized preprint servers (such as Arxiv, Biorxiv and PeerJ preprints), or posting on a personal or employer's website do not constitute prior publication. In case of doubt, please contact proceedings@iscb.org    
 After acceptance papers will have to be formatted according to the layout style required by the OUP Bioinformatics  journal and will be limited to 9 pages. Formatting requirements can be found at:  
  https://academic.oup.com/pages/authoring/journals/preparing_your_manuscript?login=true  
   
   Templates are available on OUP’s site for direct download:  
  http://static.primary.prod.gcms.the-infra.com/static/site/journals/document/oup-authoring-template.zip?node=7987de40f2eea956bc39   
 Papers not conforming to guidelines will not be reviewed   
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work. At the time the paper is submitted to ISMB/ECCB 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal.  
 Papers will be accepted electronically via the submission system, as a PDF, until January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM in the time zone of your choice  .  *No extension will be granted* If your submission is conditionally accepted, it then MUST be resubmitted as a Word or LaTeX file to adhere to the OUP proxy requirements.

   Conference Proceedings  
 Publication of the proceedings as an online part of the journal Bioinformatics  will result in fully citable articles, indexed by Medline and ISI. See the conference proceedings for ISMB 2024  for an example of online-only publication by Oxford University Press.  
 Accepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in an open access, online-only, section of a regular issue of the Bioinformatics journal with an electronic version distributed to conference delegates. The proceedings will be available online approximately one month prior to the conference opening.  
 ISMB/ECCB 2025 provides authors of accepted papers an oral presentation to provide an oral summary of their work. All presentations should be no longer than 20 minutes including 3-4 minutes for discussion. Paper presenters must register and pay to attend and present at the conference.  
 - top -    
   Hybrid format  
 All presenters who have been granted a waiver to present virtually will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference. The pre-recorded talk will be kept on hand in case of any issues that may interfere with the presenters ability to present virtually. If this video is not submitted and an issue arises any delays will be deducted from the allotted presentation time  .

  ISCB POLICY STATEMENTS 

   *Dates subject to change without notice  
 Why aren't extensions allowed?  
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.

 Call for Full Papers  

 Call for Full Papers   
 The European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is the prime European forum for the presentation of original research in the field of Information Retrieval.   
 Topics of Interest   
 ECIR 2025 invites the submission of high-quality and original papers in the broad field of Information Retrieval – this primarily includes textual or textual with multimodal information. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:   
 Search and ranking, | including retrieval models and ranking, query and content analysis, web search, and theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval; 
  User aspects in IR | , including information interaction, contextualisation, personalisation, simulation, characterisation, and behaviours; 
  System aspects | , including retrieval and recommendation architectures, efficiency and scalability; 
  Conversational search and recommender systems | , focusing on natural language understanding and generation, dialogue management, multimodal interaction, and user engagement in search processes; 
  Explainability methods | , addressing the transparency, interpretability, and accountability of AI-driven systems, particularly for information retrieval, recommendation, and personalisation; 
  Machine Learning and Large Language Models | for information retrieval and recommendation; 
  Applications | , such as web search, recommender systems, web and social media apps, professional and domain-specific search, novel interfaces to search tools, intelligent search, and conversational agents; 
  Evaluation research | , including new metrics and novel methods for the measurement and evaluation of retrieval and/or recommendation systems, users, and/or applications; 
  New social and technical challenges in IR | , such as bias, ethics, fake news, and hate speech, IR-focused trustworthy & explainable AI methodologies and techniques. 
  Full Paper Track   
 The Full Paper Track provides the opportunity for researchers to present their state-of-the-art research in Information Retrieval, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.   
 Full papers are up to | 12 pages in length | plus additional pages for references. Appendices count toward the page limit. Please put appendices | before | the references for paper submission. 
  Full papers will be refereed through | double-blind peer review | , with an initial first-stage review followed by a second stage of discussion led by a meta-reviewer. 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word (to be found at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   ), for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers (  https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid   ).   
 All submissions must be written in English. All papers should be submitted electronically through the EasyChair submission system (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecir2025   )   
 In addition, the corresponding author of each accepted paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the paper has been submitted, changes relating to its authorship cannot be made.   
 Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The proceedings will be distributed to all delegates at the conference. Accepted papers will have to be presented at the conference by one of the authors in person – and at least one author for each accepted contribution will be required to register and attend.   
 Dual Submission Policy   
 Papers submitted to ECIR 2025 should be substantially different from papers that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that are under review at other venues. Exceptions to this rule are:   
 Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings. 
  Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report (e.g., in institutional archives or preprint archives like arXiv). However, we discourage this since it places anonymity at risk; in particular, please do not publish your paper at arXiv and submit it to ECIR at the same time, some days before, or during the reviewing period of ECIR. If your paper already is available as a technical report, you might not want to use the exact same title and abstract for your ECIR submission (in case of acceptance at ECIR, the title of your submission still might be changed back). 
  Please do not cite your technical report and make some effort to avoid any issues that may harm the double-blindness of your submission. Reviewers will receive guidance that ask them to refrain from trying to break blindness if at all possible too, but be aware that the availability of an available technical report for an ECIR submission can cause issues. 
  Ethics and Professional Conduct   
 ECIR 2025 expects authors (as well as the PC, and the organising committee) to adhere to accepted standards on ethics and professionalism in our community, namely:   
 The | ACM’s Policy on Authorship | , 
  The | ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct | , 
  The | ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy Against Harassment | .

  Call for Papers 
  The 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) will be held in Koblenz, Germany, (June 10-11, 2025) as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).  
 Aims and scope   
 The European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches.  
 Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results.  
 In the technical track, we invite high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results related to MBE.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:  
 Foundation Papers | , dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects. 
  Application Papers | , dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place. 
  Submission process   
 Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template ( https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip  ) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken.  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.  
 All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair (link to be published).  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Foundations of MBE | , including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc. 
  Novel paradigms | , formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc. 
  Interplay between MBE with and for | AI-based systems. 
  Application of MBE methods | , tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT. 
  Successful use of MBE | in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance. 
  Educational aspects of MBE. 
  Tools | and | initiatives | for the successful | adoption of MBE in industry. 
  Review criteria and process   
 The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigour, and suitability for the conference.  
 Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected.  
 Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission. Revisions that significantly lessen the contribution of the work or fail to address the reviewers’ original concerns adequately will result in the paper’s rejection. Papers not accepted but with a sufficient level of quality may be encouraged to be re-submitted next year, or alternatively as regular JOT articles, hence continuing their review process through the normal journal channels.  
 Papers will be published in the JOT journal as soon as they are accepted and one of their authors registers at the conference.  
 Artifacts   
 Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication.  
 Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.

 Submission Types   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. We are currently in discussion whether to go Open Access for ICGT 2025. We will update and detail the calls as soon as possible.  
 (1) Regular research papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), including papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (2) Tool presentation papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description (up to XX pages) which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings.  
 (3) Blue Skies  (up to XX pages), reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories.  
 Furthermore, there will also be a Journal-First track  allowing for previously published work (in book chapters, journals, or other conferences since 2021) to be presented at ICGT 2025.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA).

  Call for Papers 
  The 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) will be held in Koblenz, Germany, (June 10-11, 2025) as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).  
 Aims and scope   
 The European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches.  
 Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results.  
 In the technical track, we invite high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results related to MBE.  
   
 Call for Papers  
  
 We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:  
 Foundation Papers | , dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects. 
  Application Papers | , dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place. 
  Submission process   
 Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template ( https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip  ) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken.  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.  
 All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair (link to be published).  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Foundations of MBE | , including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc. 
  Novel paradigms | , formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc. 
  Interplay between MBE with and for | AI-based systems. 
  Application of MBE methods | , tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT. 
  Successful use of MBE | in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance. 
  Educational aspects of MBE. 
  Tools | and | initiatives | for the successful | adoption of MBE in industry. 
  Review criteria and process   
 The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigour, and suitability for the conference.  
 Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected.  
 Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission. Revisions that significantly lessen the contribution of the work or fail to address the reviewers’ original concerns adequately will result in the paper’s rejection. Papers not accepted but with a sufficient level of quality may be encouraged to be re-submitted next year, or alternatively as regular JOT articles, hence continuing their review process through the normal journal channels.  
 Papers will be published in the JOT journal as soon as they are accepted and one of their authors registers at the conference.  
 Artifacts   
 Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication.  
 Publication   
 All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.  
 Contact   
 Chairs can be contacted using the following email address: ecmfa2025@easychair.org

  ECOOP 2025  ( series  ) /  Technical Papers ECOOP 2025   
   
 Call for Papers   
 ECOOP is a conference about programming originally focused on object orientation, but now including all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems and environments. ECOOP solicits innovative solutions to real problems as well as evaluations of existing solutions.  
 Authors are asked to pick one of the following categories:  
 Research. | The most traditional category for papers that advance the state of the art. 
  Replication. | An empirical evaluation that reconstructs a published experiment in a different context in order to validate the results of that earlier work. 
  Experience. | Applications of known PL techniques in practice as well as tools. Industry papers will be reviewed by practitioners. We welcome negative results that may provide inspiration for future research. 
  Pearls/Brave New Ideas. | Articles that either explain a known idea in an elegant way or unconventional papers introducing ideas that may take some time to substantiate. These papers may be short. 
  Submissions   
 Submission must not have been published, or have major overlap with previous work. In case of doubt, contact the chairs. Proceedings are published in open access by Dagstuhl LIPIcs in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs LaTeX-style template  . To reduce friction when resubmitting, ACM’s PACMPL and TOPLAS formatted papers can be submitted as such (with the understanding that if accepted, they will be reformatted).  
 ECOOP uses double-anonymous reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must omit author names and institutions, and use the third person when referencing the authors’ own work. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the FAQ  . If in doubt, contact the chairs.  
 There is no page limit on submissions, but authors must understand that reviewers have a fixed time budget for each paper, so the length of the feedback is likely to be unaffected by length. Brevity is a virtue. Authors also have to consider that the camera-ready version must be (at most) 25 pages  in LIPIcs format (not including references).  
 Authors will be given a three-day period to read and respond to the reviews of their papers before the program committee meeting. Responses have no length limit.  
 ECOOP will continue to have two deadlines for submissions. Papers submitted in each round can be (a) accepted, (b) rejected, or (c) asked for revisions. Rejected papers that are submitted to the immediate next round can be desk-rejected if they do not sufficiently differ from the previous submission. Revisions can be submitted at any later round. Papers retain their reviewers during revision.  
 Review Criteria   
 Each paper will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
 Soundness: How well the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods; 
  Significance: The extent to which the paper’s contributions are novel, original, and important, with respect to the existing body of knowledge; 
  Presentation: Whether the paper’s quality of writing meets the high standards of ECOOP. 
  After author response and reviewer discussion, papers will be accepted if the PC decides that the paper meets our high bar for Soundness and Presentation, and if ONE reviewer judges the paper to meet the bar for Significance. The goal of this process is to ensure quality of writing and confidence in results, while assuming that if one reviewer finds the paper to be significant then there will be readers who do so as well.  
 Artifact Evaluation and Intent   
 To support replication of experiments, authors of research papers may submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. They will be asked whether they intend to submit an artifact at submission time. It is understood that some papers do not have artifacts. AEC members will serve on the extended review committee.  
 Journal First and Journal After   
 We have Journal First/After arrangements with ACM’s Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), Elsevier’s Science of Computer Programming (SCP) and AITO’s Journal of Object Technology (JOT).  
 Only new research papers are eligible to be Journal First (JF). JF papers will have an extended abstract in the ECOOP proceedings. The deadline is the same as Round 1 of submissions and the notification is aligned with Round 2 notification. TOPLAS JF papers should be submitted according to this announcement. SCP JF papers should follow this call for papers. JF papers are presented at the conference and eligible for awards.  
 Journal After (JA) papers are papers for which the authors request to be considered for post conference journal publication. Once accepted by the ECOOP PC, these papers will be forwarded to the journal editors. Reviews and reviewers will be forwarded and used at the editor’s discretion. JA papers will have an extended abstract (up to 12 pages) in the conference proceedings.
