 Call for Participation: Peace!

 “Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.” (Source: Wikipedia  )  
 This event is addressed to all people.  
 In times of these especially to those of Russia, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. But also to those of Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burundi, El Salvador, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Congo, Cuba, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.  
 Regarding #KMers this event is extremely crucial because they regularly love to promote that Knowledge Management is all about people, a culture of knowledge sharing and co-creation, and at the end of the day the source of a better and more wealthy world.  

  “When the power of love overcomes the love of power,  
  the world will know peace.”   
  Jimi Hendrix   
 “Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there.  
  Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means;  
  through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.”   
  Dalai Lama XIV   

 Therefore we especially expect contributions from #KMers, their leaders, communities and their supposed representatives. Especially from #KMers of the countries mentioned above and those who are affiliated with these countries’ #KMers.  
  
 “Imagination is more important than knowledge.  
  For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand,  
  while imagination embraces the entire world,  
  and all there ever will be to know and understand.”

 “Imagine all the people Livin’ life in peace”

 We are looking forward to your contribution, statement or action. Here, on twitter  , Linkedin  & Co., or somewhere else.  
 Peace!

 In my observation and interacting in trying to ensure that to be harmonious and building Peaceful Communities: Strategies for Conflict Prevention*  
 Communities are the foundation of a harmonious society. When individuals come together, share resources, and support one another, they create a vibrant and thriving environment. However, conflicts can arise, threatening the very fabric of community life. To avoid conflict and preserve peace, communities can adopt the following strategies:  
 1. *Foster Open Communication*: Encourage active listening, empathy, and transparent dialogue to address concerns and resolve issues before they escalate.  
 2. *Promote Cultural Understanding*: Celebrate diversity, organize cultural events, and educate members about different backgrounds to break down stereotypes and build bridges.  
 3. *Encourage Collaboration*: Engage in joint projects, share resources, and work together towards common goals to build trust and strengthen relationships.  
 4. *Establish Clear Conflict Resolution Mechanisms*: Develop and publicize accessible, fair, and effective processes for resolving disputes, ensuring all voices are heard.  
 5. *Empower Community Leaders*: Train and support leaders to mediate conflicts, facilitate dialogue, and promote peaceful resolution.  
 6. *Address Inequality and Injustice*: Identify and address underlying issues like poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to resources to prevent resentment and frustration.  
 7. *Foster a Sense of Belonging*: Encourage community engagement, volunteerism, and social connections to create a shared sense of identity and purpose.  
 8. *Provide Education and Training*: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational programs on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and community development.  
 9. *Celebrate Peace and Diversity*: Organize events, festivals, and initiatives promoting peace, tolerance, and cultural diversity to reinforce community values.  
 10. *Seek External Support When Needed*: Collaborate with external organizations, mediators, or experts to address complex conflicts or provide additional resources.  
 By implementing these strategies, communities can create a culture of peace, understanding, and cooperation, reducing the likelihood of conflict and promoting a harmonious environment for all members.

 To attain peace within our communities and on a global scale, it is imperative that we wholeheartedly adopt the foundational principles encapsulated in the ideology of “Ubuntu,” a philosophy emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual reliance of all human beings. Central to the essence of Ubuntu are five fundamental values crucial for fostering harmony and understanding among individuals and societies alike. These values include the promotion of survival, highlighting our common responsibility to ensure the well-being and longevity of one another; the cultivation of a spirit of solidarity, which underscores the significance of standing together and supporting each other in times of need; the practice of compassion, encouraging empathy, kindness, and a genuine concern for the welfare of all; the principle of respect, advocating for the appreciation of diversity, opinions, and beliefs while honoring the inherent worth and dignity of every human being; and the recognition of dignity, affirming the intrinsic value and rights of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances. By embracing and embodying these core values of Ubuntu in our interactions and behaviors, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, inclusive, and harmonious world for present and future generations.

 For the development of peace in the world, it is very necessary to increase human knowledge and social awareness. Therefore, different governments should try to increase human social knowledge through social knowledge management at the global level. In my opinion, the task of the International Association of Knowledge Management in today’s knowledge-driven world is to develop social knowledge to increase synergy in solving human social problems at the global level. In my opinion, to achieve peace in the world and a better life in the future, today’s mankind must think globally and act locally. In the sense that he thinks with the people of the world and shares his knowledge at different social levels in the world.

 Dear AIS Community,  
 can you educate political leaders worldwide for better governance and get rid of corruption? The AIS must help removing world poverty and hunger. If AIS diverts its research attention for these noble causes, that will be great.  
 Can world afford to lose the peace and stability for one leader in Russia? No respect to human values and innocent people and children are getting killed just for nothing.

 Brave of you to start a conversation on this topic. Thank you.  
  If we could only get all world leaders and war mongers to read the evidence on the impacts of war … on their people, land. Oh wait…they don’t care about that… But maybe we can get them to read the evidence about war on their own mental health and life span, fertility. We need some serious knowledge mobilizers on this job!

 From KMers in Germany  :  
 “… schauen wir exemplarisch in den Osten unseres Kontinents, wo seit dem 24. Februar ein veritabler Krieg in und um die Ukraine tobt. Naja, eigentlich bereits seit acht Jahren, wenn man es ernst nimmt. Unsere besten Wünsche und Bitten begleiten unsere ukrainischen Nachbarn und jene Menschen in Russland, denen dieser Krieg ebenfalls zuwider ist. ” – GfWM Reginalgruppe Frankfurt    
 From KMers in India  :  
 “*** It is , indeed, very Shocking…what Putin is doing in Ukraine… The Fact is… Russia is a very powerful Country and even if Ukraine became a NATO Member…it would have caused No Harm to Russia… unnecessary… Putin is Killing innocent people and causing all devastation of War… Horrible Horrible.”  – KMer from Mumbai  
 From KMers in Switzerland  :  
 “…I am deeply shocked about the violent invasion of Ukraine. I wish the Ukrainian people – as all people on our planet – peace, happiness and health… There are several assets which increase when shared: Besides knowledge, they are e.g. love, trust, appreciation, joy and empathy – just to name a few. So always remember: Sharing is caring! I’d like to mention this quote especially in the context of the violent invasion of Ukraine, which is only caused by the absurd love of power from a handful of people….”  – Johannes (Jonny) Müller  , Zug  
 From KMers in the USA  :  
 “As our world grows increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent, the tendency toward reductionism is stronger than ever (blame everything on Trump, Biden, Putin, China, corporate greed, climate, racism, whatever…)  
  We need to do a better job of organizing our ever-expanding bodies of knowledge in ways that allow us to reveal the often deeply-hidden root causes of the conditions that we see on the surface, which are almost always just a tiny fraction of the total picture  
  Integrating key technologies such as text analytics, stratified ontology, AI/ML, graph databases, and knowledge graphs is a critical step toward creating a better future by giving us the knowledge we need to make more enlightened decisions, which means looking as far as seven generations ahead or more…”  – KMer from Boyce, VA

 PAKDD Conference Guide  
 The PAKDD Steering Committee provides oversight of the PAKDD series of conferences. Conferences are generally run autonomously, with reference to the steering committee for guidance. The following guidelines aim to capture the common understanding between the sterring committee and the conference organisers.  
  Awards  
  
 A number of awards are presented at the conference dinner as either plaques or certificates. The following suggestions may assist the PC and the organising committee:  
 Two | Student Paper Awards | including complimentary registration for the next PAKDD conference and a $500 (USD) grant to support travel, funded by the PAKDD Steering Committee, selected by the PC. | *Best Paper Award | selected by the PC. This can be split into two awards, one for best research paper and the other for best applied paper or the paper which best demonstrates good research and repeatability (e.g., by making the algorithm available as open source software). A | plaque | is arranged by the local organising committee to be presented. 
  The | Most Influential Paper | Award is selected from the conference 10 years ago by SC (e.g., in 2012 we selected from 2002). The SC chair appoints a selection committee (a chair and two members from the SC) in November each year for the next conference. The SC Chair identifies the paper citations using Google Scholar (an automated counter is available) and this may guide the selection of the committee. The most cited papers are reviewed by the committee for impact, influence, novelty, and significance. Recommendations are presented to the SC in January for endorsement and the conference organisers and winner informed in March so that plaques can be arranged and the recipient can arrange travel for attendance. A | plaque | is arranged by the local organising committee to be presented. 
  The | Distinguished Contribution | Award is selected by a committee of previous recipients of the Award. Once the committee has decided on the recipient, the nomination is presented to the Steering Committee for their endorsement. The recipient is then notified to confirm their attendance at the conference. The conference organisers arrange for a plaque which is presented during the conference banquet by the SC Chair. A | plaque | is arranged by the local organising committee to be presented. 
  The | Student Travel Awards | are funded by the PAKDD Steering Committee to support student authors of accepted papers to help them defray part of the cost of attending the conference to present their work. The Student Travel Awards will be presented in cash to the winners at the conference reception. The amount of award for different winners may be different according to the needs of the applicants and the capacity of the fund. Typically, the amount for each award will be around USD $400 with 10 awards available. The awards are administered by the conference organisers. See | PAKDD 2015 Student Awards | for an example. 
  The plaque used for the major awards is often a golden coloured A4 (297mm x 210mm) plate on a wooden mount.  

  Call for Papers  
  
 The recommended target audiences for placing the call-for-papers include:  
 KDNuggets 
  DBWorld 
  ML List 

  Conference Schedule  
  
 Three and a half days is a good length.  
 The first day is generally for workshops and tutorials. These are run in parallel. Running tutorials in parallel with the main conference presents challenges, so the recommendation is to run them on the first day in parallel with the workshops.  
 The conference reception is often held on the evening of the day of the workshops and tutorials. Many attendees arrive that day. The reception often includes finger food, and often enough to make a light meal, but also allowing attendees to organise themselves to go out for dinner if they desire.  
 The second day is the openning of the main conference, often beginning with a keynote presentation. The evening is often kept clear for participants to make their own arrangements.  
 The second evening is also often the Steering Committee annual general meeting and working dinner, hosted by the conference.  
 The conference organisers will arrange the steering committee meeting and dinner. The meeting runs for 3 hours. The first 90 minutes covers the following agenda for all the SC plus invited guests from the current, previous and future conferences:  
 Opening and welcoming by the SC Chair or Co-Chair 
  Report from previous year’s conference - financial summary 
  Update on the current conference 
  Presentation from the organisers of the next year’s conference 
  Proposal for the next year plus one conference 
  General discussion 
  The remaining time is for the SC only to discuss other items and to make decisions regarding future conferences and SC membership.  
 The next year’s conference decision will be announced at the conference banquet. The conference organiser will also make a presentation at the banquet.  
 The third day is often a half day, with a organised tour for the afternoon, followed by the conference dinnner.  
 The final day is a full day. Finishing the conference with an invited panel session including the invited and keynote speakers can often be a good closing point. Often something like learnings from the conference and where to now. The aim is to bring everyone together for the end of the conference for a wrap up, and to encourage attendees to remain until the end to avoid the slump in attendance for the final few sessions. It also provides a definite end point, rather than simply fading out!  

  Conference Services  
  
 Airport Transportation  
 Transfers to and from the airport can often be organised by the conference and are a welcoming sign to the conference attendees! If other very convenient transfer arrangements are available (e.g., direct link into the local train or bus system and convenient location of a station or stop to the hotel) then that is often adequate and could be clearly noted on the conference web site.  

  Final Programme  
  
 A serious problem is the no-show. Authors have paid their registration to get their paper published, but don’t turn up - they’ve already got what they wanted or else last minute changes of plans have required them not to travel!  
 The main problem here is attendees turning up to a session where only 2 of the 5 presenters have arrived. It looks bad and provides a negative talking point.  
 A simple solution is to delay production of the final progamme as much as possible. Before final printing get confirmation from each author that they can still attend and remove from the programme those who can not.  
 Please also refer to the PAKDD No Show policy on the PAKDD Web Site  and direct authors to this policy so it is very clear what our expectations are and waht actions the conference organisers will take if the rules are breached.  

  Financials  
  
 A $5000 (USD) seed grant is available on application to the PAKDD SC Chair. The seed money is to be repaid to the PAKDD SC at the conclusion of the conference, before any surplus is calculated.  
 If a conference makes a loss (which has not occurred) the PAKDD SC can decide to underwrite that loss up to an amount of only $5000 (USD). If seed money was provided for the conference, the maximum amount of support for any loss will be reduced by the amount of the seed money provided.  
 If the conference ends up raising funds in surplus (the only situation we have had so far) the surplus (after returning any seed money) is split 50/50 with the PAKDD SC. Such funds are only to be used for the benefit of the conferences into the future, in line with the Steering Committee Rules  .  

  Invited Speakers  
  
 PAKDD uses the following process for all invited speakers and especially those for whom financial support is provided e.g., airfare and accommodation). This includes Keynote Speakers, Tutorial Speakers, Summer School Speakers, etc.  
 For Tutorial Speakers, the Tutorial Chair will take care of the standard process. For Keynote Speakers and Summer School Speakers (if there is a Summer School), the General Chairs or Program Committee Chairs will execute the process.  
 The process is:  
 The PC Chairs and General Chairs propose names and also ask the Steering Committee for nominations. 
  The PC Chairs and the General Chairs create the list, and filter out anyone who has been an invited speaker in the past 4 years in PAKDD. The reason for this is to expose the PAKDD community to a diversity of opinions/view/ideas. This also helps to bring PAKDD to the notice of well regarded people outside of the existing PAKDD community, thus increasing its visibility. 
  The PC Chairs and the General Chairs rank the nominated candidates based on (i) their visibility, (ii) relevance of area, (iii) experience in speaking in other forums, etc. 
  The PC Chairs select the top 3 for Keynotes, and 1 for any Data Mining School and send it to the Steering Committee for approval. The Steering Committee can come back to the PC Chairs and the General Chairs with specific advice about exclusions. 
  With the final list approved by the Steering Committee, the PC Chairs invite the speakers. They must be careful not to invite anyone or make promises to anyone before the process has been completed and the Steering Committee approval obtained.

  Locations  
  
 The PAKDD conference series aims to support the emergance of KDD research and technology in the Pacific and Asian regions. The conference locations are spread throughout the region. Whilst there is no explicit rule regarding location the general principle is to move through the region from China, Japan/Korea, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Australia/New Zealand, and the Pacific from year to year.  
 The next year’s conference is announced at the current conference’s banquet dinner. Any decision regarding the conference two years hence is not announced nor confirmed until it is only one year hence, when the General Chairs, PCs, and invited speakers are expected to have bene line up.  

  Paper Submission Policy Guidelines  
  
 These guidelines were developed by the PAKDD Organising and Steering Committee in 2007 as a recommendation for adoption by future PAKDD Conference Organisers.  
 PAKDD Paper Submission Policy  
 The scope of PAKDD and the required format and page limitations are indicated in the Call For Papers of PAKDD.  
 The paper must fit the scope of PAKDD. 
  The paper must conform to the required format and page limitations. 
  The paper must be original, and must not be published or under consideration to be published elsewhere. 
  Plagiarism is unacceptable. | The verbatim copy and/or reuse of material (text, formula, graphics) from other published papers (either by the author or by other authors) without explicit citation, is considered to be plagiarism. Quotations should be clearly identified and include the appropriate citation. For example, “According to Smith and Jones (2007) ‘……’”, or “‘……’ (Smith and Jones, 2007). 
  When a new submission is based on the authors or on another author’s previously published works, the citation of the previous works should be clearly given in the new paper. Furthermore, the novel contribution of the current paper, which extends the previous works, should be clearly indicated. 
  This policy on plagiarism for PAKDD has benefited from the guidelines on how to handle plagiarism statement developed by the IEEE.  
 No-Show Policy  
 PAKDD defines “no-show” as the author (or one of the authors) not being present g at their allocated conference/workshop session for presentation of their paper. PAKDD categorizes no-shows and takes the identified actions as below:  
 Withdrawal, before proceedings are finalised. 
  If none of the authors register for the conference/workshop before the required deadline, prior to the proceedings being finalised, the paper will be deemed as being withdrawn from the conference, and will not be included in the proceedings or the conference program.  
 Good faith no-show, after final program is published. 
  When none of the authors can attend the conference for their paper presentation, due to unforeseen circumstances, the authors MUST inform the PC chairs immediately the situation arises. The authors are required to arrange for a delegate to present the paper at the conference/workshop, and the authors must identify the surrogate presenter to the PC chairs prior to the conference.  
 Bad faith no-show during conference. 
  If the authors fail to inform the conference organiser of their change in circumstances and are not available for the presentation of their paper, the conference will inform the authors’ organization. In addition, if the authors have a record of bad faith no-show with previous PAKDD conferences, the proceedings will not be made available to the authors, and future submissions to PAKDD conferences by the authors will be barred for up to three years.  
 This document was drafted 7 May 2007 by Takashi Washio and reviewed by Jaideep Srivastava. Updated 6 June 2007 by Graham Williams.   

  Proceedings  
  
 The proceedings are published by Springer as part of the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series. Alfred Hoffman is the Springer contact and can often best be contacted by phone rather than email.  
 The Steering Committee should be listed in the Organisation section.  
 The workshop proceedings are also published by Springer as part of the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series as a post conference publication. Papers could be available during the workshop to attendees, and the workshop chairs should provide at least an additional review from the workshop presentations. Authors then have an opportunity to resubmit with any small changes for the post conference publication.  

  Program Committee Chairs  
  
 The Steering Committee recommends that a recognised international researcher in data mining be appointed as the Program Committee Chair. Their role is to encourage international participation in the conference and ensures the ongoing credibility and integrity of the conference.  
 Co-chairs will also be appointed by the particular conference organisers. One of the co-chairs will be identified as responsible for the administration of the paper submission and review system.  
 The organisation and program committees for the coming year’s conference should be agreed to by the steering committee, finalised and confirmed by the time the conference is announced at the conference banquet.  

  Proposals  
  
 Proposals for hosting the conference are always welcome and should be sent to the Steering Committee chair or any other member of the Steering Committee for their support and presentation to the Steering Committee.  
 Proposals are considered at the Steering Committee’s annual general meeting hosted by the conference. The bid for the coming year’s conference is considered and the steering committee makes their final decision on which bid to proceed with. This will then be announced at the conference dinner.  
 Proposals for more than just the following year are also welcome and encouraged. This allows the steering committee to review the proposal early and to provide feedback for the final bid.  

  Registration Fee  
  
 A registration fee of approximately USD $550 (early bird) is the target. A student fee of USD $350 (early bird) is also suggested. This covers conference, workshops, and tutorials. For particular locations, the conference organisers may decide to charge a smaller fee for local registrations to encourage local participation. Workshop-only fees (for example USD $180 early bird) may also be appropriate, but we do want to encourage attendees to stay on for the whole conference.  

  Review Process  
  
 Past PAKDD conference have had an acceptance rate from 15% to 30%. Do not exceed 30%. Up to 90 papers is the norm.  
 Conference organisers have conflicts of interest whenever they are also authors of papers. The conference PC chairs must not be an author of any accepted papers. Similarly, tutorial chairs can not submit tutorial proposals and workshop chairs can not submit workshop proposals. Also, conference organisers can not present invited/keynote talks.  

  Session Chairs  
  
 Session charis must be organised prior to the conference and identified in the conference program.  
 Avoid having as a session chair one of the authors of a paper in the session. It tends to make it awkward for the chair to also present a paper.  
 The following may usefully be handed to each session chair. Be sure to remind all speakers during the openning to report to their session 5minutes prior to the session time.  
 Guidance for Chairs of PAKDD Sessions  
 Prior to the beginning of your session:  
 Please check “Program” on the Web Page in advance. Your session may consist of long presentations (20min talk and 5min discussion) and short presentations (12min talk and 3min discussion). 
  Come to the room approximately 5 minutes before your session starts, and check that each speaker is in the room. In addition, confirm the pronunciation of the speaker’s name and affiliation. 
  Ask all speakers to copy their slides into the conference provided computers. 
  If you find any problem with the environment of your session room, please contact our volunteer who is in the room. The volunteer is identified by their name badge and t-shirt. 
  During and after your session:  
 At the beginning of your session, inform the speakers of the times allocated to their talks and discussions according to the conference program booklet. 
  Please keep the session on schedule. You are responsible to maintain the schedule accurately. 
  Please let all speakers use the microphone when it is provided. Please take care of the speakers not to hide the screen from the audience. 
  Remind every speaker their remaining time. The presentation of a long presentation-based paper includes 20min talk and 5min discussion, the presentation of a short presentation-based paper includes 12min talk and 3min discussion. 
  Please take note of “NO SHOW” presentations and inform the registration desk after your session. 
  In case that a presentation ends earlier than the scheduled time or is a “NO SHOW”, you may use the extra time for discussions among the audience and yourself, in order to cater for the schedule for the next presentation. 
  Emergency: | If there is any urgent business, please contact the volunteer at the conference room, or the registration desk. 

  Steering Committee Rules  
  
 The steering must abide by the following rules that can be found here   

  Submission Management Systems  
  
 The Steering Committee, based on feedback from past conferences, recommends the use of the free EasyChair  conference system, which is hosted by the University of Manchester Computer Science Department. Simply register at their web site.  
 The PAKDD 2010 committee has also recommended the use of the free and open source SubSift  for assigning papers to reviewers.  
 Plagiarism is an important issue to be aware of. Papers can be searched for through Google, for example.  
 Please be sure to ask the submitter of a paper whether the paper is a student paper. A student paper would normally have a student as the first author and would register as a student.

  SCOPE  
  ________________________________________________________________________________________  
  The success of Bioinformatics in recent years has been prompted by research in Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine in several initiatives. These initiatives gave rise to an exponential increase in the volume and diversification of data, including nucleotide and protein sequences and annotations, high-throughput experimental data, biomedical literature, among many others.  
  Systems Biology is a related research area that has been replacing the reductionist view that dominated Biology research in the last decades, requiring the coordinated efforts of biological researchers with those related to data analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulation and optimization.  
  The accumulation and exploitation of large-scale data bases prompts for new computational technology and for research into these issues. In this context, many widely successful computational models and tools used by biologists in these initiatives, such as clustering and classification methods for gene expression data, are based on Computer Science/ Artificial Intelligence (CS/AI) techniques. In fact, these methods have been helping in tasks related to knowledge discovery, modeling and optimization tasks, aiming at the development of computational models so that the response of biological complex systems to any perturbation can be predicted.  
  The 16th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics (PACBB) aims to promote the interaction among the scientific community to discuss applications of CS/AI with an interdisciplinary character, exploring the interactions between sub-areas of CS/AI, Bioinformatics, Chemoinformatics and Systems Biology.  
  Brand new ideas in these fields are sought, as well as substantial and relevant revisions and actualizations of previously presented work, project summaries and PhD thesis presented or not.

 Date:   
 Tuesday, August 30, 2022  to Friday, September 2, 2022    

 Description:   
 The 2020 silver anniversary edition of PATAT was originally intended to be held by KU Leuven in Bruges (Belgium), but had to be postponed until 2022 in light of the pandemic. The conference will now instead be held in the equally beautiful city of Leuven (Belgium)  , the university's home town, and will run from Tuesday 30th August until Friday 2nd September 2022  . The venue will be the Irish College, which promises to offer the perfect setting for researchers and practitioners to reflect, present and discuss on the substantial progress made by the timetabling academic community over the last twenty-seven years as well as to anticipate where we might be headed throughout the coming decades. To complement this historical reflection and anticipation of the future, a range of exciting plenary talks will be given by experts in established areas of timetabling as well as newly emerging ones. We therefore wish to extend a warm invitation to anyone with an interest in timetabling or related problems to participate by submitting a paper by March 23rd 2022  .  
 Some topics of interest for the conference include, but are certainly not limited to, the following: timetabling problems (e.g., educational timetabling, timetabling in transport, employee rostering, sports timetabling, timetabling in healthcare), timetabling algorithms (e.g., mathematical programming, heuristic search, metaheuristics - Evolutionary Computation, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Ant Colony Methods, hyper-heuristics, machine learning, matheuristics, constraint-based methods, algorithm portfolios, parallel/distributed computing, multi-objective/multi-criteria approaches), foundational/theoretical studies (e.g. complexity issues), timetabling tools and applications, and any optimization issues related to timetabling.  
 A special track is planned, dedicated to the International Timetabling Competitions on University Course Timetabling (ITC 2019) and Sports Timetabling (ITC 2021)  
 We are pleased to announce that the invited speakers who were confirmed in principle for the 2020 edition have agreed, travel restrictions permitting, to deliver plenary talks at the 2022 edition:  
 Celso C. Ribeiro, Computer Science, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil 
  Sigrid Knust, Institut für Informatik, Universität Osnabrück, Germany 
  Andrea Schaerf, Polytechnic Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Udine, Italy 
  Deepak Ajwani, School of Computer Science, University College Dublin, Ireland 
  Peter Nightingale, Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK 
  We look forward to welcoming you to Leuven where you will be free to sample some of the finest versions of the very best things life has to offer: Belgian chocolate, beer and fries!  
 Submission Guidelines

 AIM AND SCOPE  
 The International Series of Conferences on the Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling (PATAT) is held biennially as the main ,international forum for both researchers and practitioners of timetabling to exchange ideas. PATAT 2024 which is the fourteenth in the ,conference series will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark.  
 Whether it is sporting events, educational institutions, transportation or employee management the construction of efficient timetables which ,provide the maximum in way of flexibility for all constituent parts, including stakeholders, is as important as it is challenging. An increasingly important aspect within organisations is an automated approach which optimises all aspects of resource usage. In doing so a number of quantitative and qualitative challenges must be dealt with from both a technical and practical perspective.  
 An important aim of the conference is to align the needs of practitioners and the objectives of researchers. This is achieved through the presentation and application of leading-edge research techniques. Practitioners and Researchers alike are encouraged to present their work and experiences with the overall goal of developing efficient and practical solutions. With this goal in mind, at PATAT  
  2024, researchers and practitioners will be brought together through a number of key presentations and contributed talks.

 PATAT 2022 - Call for papers   
   Submitted by watt  on Tue, 2022-02-01 08:15    
 The 2020 silver anniversary edition of PATAT was originally intended to be held by KU Leuven in Bruges (Belgium), but had to be postponed until 2022 in light of the pandemic. The conference will now instead be held in the equally beautiful city of Leuven (Belgium)  , the university's home town, and will run from Tuesday 30th August until Friday 2nd September 2022  . The venue will be the Irish College, which promises to offer the perfect setting for researchers and practitioners to reflect, present and discuss on the substantial progress made by the timetabling academic community over the last twenty-seven years as well as to anticipate where we might be headed throughout the coming decades. To complement this historical reflection and anticipation of the future, a range of exciting plenary talks will be given by experts in established areas of timetabling as well as newly emerging ones. We therefore wish to extend a warm invitation to anyone with an interest in timetabling or related problems to participate by submitting a paper by March 23rd 2022  .  
 Some topics of interest for the conference include, but are certainly not limited to, the following: timetabling problems (e.g., educational timetabling, timetabling in transport, employee rostering, sports timetabling, timetabling in healthcare), timetabling algorithms (e.g., mathematical programming, heuristic search, metaheuristics - Evolutionary Computation, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Ant Colony Methods, hyper-heuristics, machine learning, matheuristics, constraint-based methods, algorithm portfolios, parallel/distributed computing, multi-objective/multi-criteria approaches), foundational/theoretical studies (e.g. complexity issues), timetabling tools and applications, and any optimization issues related to timetabling.  
 A special track is planned, dedicated to the International Timetabling Competitions on University Course Timetabling (ITC 2019) and Sports Timetabling (ITC 2021)

 This is the first IFORS conference to be held in Asia since the 15th conference in China 20 years ago. It is thus an exciting opportunity to bring together operations researchers from the field in Asia, where it has experienced vigorous and rapid growth, with colleagues from all regions of the world.  
 The conference includes a Wednesday-afternoon social event where you can choose among a variety of tours, such as the Demilitarized Zone tour, where you can witness the history of Korea’s division, the Industrial Tour to Korea’s leading ICT companies, as well as other programs that will explore K-POP and Hallyu, K-Beauty and K-Culture, and show you the most historic buildings and markets in the city.  
 The timing of the meeting in late June assures that it will be warm and sunny.  
 2. PATAT 2020 Call for papers   
 In more ways than one, 1995 was a momentous year: a small startup by the name of Amazon sold its first book online, the first ever Wiki was launched, and the Java programming language was announced to the world. But far more importantly (some might say), the year also played host to the very first PATAT conference  in Edinburgh.  
 The 2020 edition of PATAT will therefore mark its silver anniversary. Organized by KU Leuven and to be held in beautiful Bruges (Belgium) August 25-29, 2020  , PATAT 2020 promises to provide the perfect setting for researchers and practitioners to reflect on the substantial progress made by the timetabling academic community over the last twenty-five years as well as to anticipate where we might head throughout the next twenty-five. To complement this historical reflection and anticipation of the future, a range of exciting plenary talks will be given by experts in established areas of timetabling as well as newly emerging ones. We therefore wish to extend a warm invitation to anyone with an interest in timetabling or related problems to participate by submitting a paper by January 30, 2020  . Some topics of interest for the conference include, but are certainly not limited to, the following: timetabling problems, timetabling algorithms, timetabling applications, and any optimization problems elated to timetabling.   
 We are proud to announce that the following professors will deliver plenary talks:  
 Celso C. Ribeiro, Computer Science, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil 
  Sigrid Knust, Institut für Informatik, Universität Osnabrück, Germany 
  Andrea Schaerf, Computer Science, University of Udine, Italy 
  Deepak Ajwani, School of Computer Science, University College Dublin, Ireland 
  Peter Nightingale, Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK 
  Paper/abstract submission instructions are available at https://easychair.org/cfp/PATAT2020  .  
 Please submit your paper/abstract by January 30, 2020.  
 PATAT 2020 will take place together with the COnfiguration and SElection of ALgorithms (COSEAL) workshop August 23-25, a few days before the conference begins. Further information regarding plenary speakers, paper submissions as well as the scientific and social program are available at the conference website ( http://patatconference.org/patat2020/  ).

 The 12th International Conference on the Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling (PATAT-2018) took place between 28th and 31st of August, 2018, at the TU Wien, Vienna, Austria. The conference brought together more than 80 researchers and practitioners in all aspects of computer-aided timetable generation and related issues. The PATAT-2018 program extended over 3 days and featured presentations which represent the state-of-the-art in automated timetabling: there were 4 plenary talks, 2 invited tutorials, 22 full papers and 27 extended abstracts. The program included plenary talks by Johannes Gärtner (Ximes GmbH), Louis-Martin Rousseau (École Polytechnique de Montréal), Hana Rudová (Masaryk University), and Pascal Van Hentenryck (University of Michigan), and invited tutorials by Jeffrey Kingston (University of Sydney) and Andrea Schaerf (University of Udine). The detailed conference program and proceedings of PATAT-2018 can be found in the conference website ( http://patatconference.org/patat2018/  ). As was the case in previous PATAT conferences, a post-conference volume of selected and revised papers will be published in Annals or Operational Research.  
 The PATAT-2018 conference was a great success and the participants enjoyed the invited/regular talks and various networking opportunities provided during the conference.

  Call for Papers 
  The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PEPM) has a history going back to 1991 and has been held in conjunction with POPL every year since 2006. The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.  
 Scope   
 In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:  
 Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimization. 
  Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. 
  More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2024 include, but are not limited to:  
 Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. 
  Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. 
  Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. 
  Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. 
  This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the program co-chairs, Guillaume Allais ( guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk  ) and Annie Liu ( liu@cs.stonybrook.edu  ).  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Three kinds of submissions will be accepted:  
 Regular Research Papers  should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages. 
  Short Papers  may include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages. 
  Talk Proposals  may propose lectures about topics of interest for PEPM, existing work representing relevant contributions, or promising contributions that are not mature enough to be proposed as papers of the other categories. Talk Proposals must not exceed 2 pages. 
  References and appendices are not included in page limits. Appendices may not necessarily be read by reviewers. Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at:  
 http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   
 and submitted electronically via HotCRP: https://pepm25.hotcrp.com   
 Reviewing will be single-blind.  
 Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs).  
 Accepted regular research papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted short papers do not constitute formal publications and will not appear in the proceedings.  
 At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop (physically or virtually) to present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected.

 Abstracts   

 The Ethical Compiler: Addressing the Is-Ought Gap in Compilation    
   William Bowman    
 The is-ought gap is a problem in moral philosophy observing that ethical judgments (“ought”) cannot be grounded purely in truth judgments (“is”): that an ought  cannot be derived from an is  . This gap renders the following argument invalid: “It is  true that type safe languages prevent bugs and that bugs cause harm, therefore you ought  to write in type safe languages.”. To validate ethical claims, we must bridge the gap between is and ought with some ethical axiom, such as “I believe one ought  not cause harm.”.  
 But what do ethics have to do with manipulating programs? A lot! Ethics are central to correctness! For example, suppose an algorithm infers the type of e  is Bool  , and e  is in fact a Bool  ; the program type checks. Is the program correct—does it behave as it ought  ? We cannot answer this without some ethical axioms: what does the programmer believe ought  to be?  
 I believe one ought to design and implement languages ethically. We must give the programmer the ability to express their ethics—their values and beliefs about a program—in addition to its mere computational content, and build tools that respect the distinction between is and ought. This talk is a guide to ethical language design and implementation possibilities.  
 Bio    
 William J. Bowman is an Assistant Professor of computer science in the Software Practices Lab at University of British Columbia. Broadly speaking, he is interested in making it easier for programmers to communicate their intent to machines, and preserving that intent through compilation. More specifically, their research interests include secure and verified compilation, dependently typed programming, verification, meta-programming, and interoperability. His recent work examines type-preserving compilation of dependently typed programming languages like Coq, a technique that can enable preserving security and correctness invariants of verified software through compilation and statically enforcing those invariants in the low-level (assembly-like) code generated by compilers.  

 Cocon: A Type-Theoretic Framework for Meta-Programming    
   Brigitte Pientka    
 Meta-programming is the art of writing programs that produce or manipulate other programs. This allows programmers to automate error-prone or repetitive tasks, and exploit domain- specific knowledge to customize the generated code. Hence, meta-programming is widely used in a range of technologies: from cryptographic message authentication in secure network protocols to support reflection in proof environments such as Lean.  
 Unfortunately, writing safe meta-programs remains very challenging and sometimes frustrating, as traditionally errors in the generated code are only detected when running it, but not at the time when code is generated. To make it easier to write and maintain meta-programs, tools that allow us to detect errors during code generation - instead of when running the generated code - are essential.  
 This talk revisits Cocon, a framework for certified meta-programming. Cocon is a Martin-Löf dependent type theory for defining logics and proofs that allows us to represent domain-specific languages (DSL) within the logical framework LF and in addition write recursive programs and proofs about those DSLs using pattern matching. It is a two-level type theory where Martin-Löf type theory sits on top of the logical framework LF and supports a recursor over (contextual) LF objects. As a consequence, we can embed into LF STLC or System F, etc. and then write programs about those encodings using Cocon itself.  
 This means Cocon can serve as a target for compiling meta-programming systems -from compiling meta-programming with STLC to System F. Moreover, Cocon supports writing an evaluator for each of these sub-languages. This also allows us to reflect back our encoded sub-language and evaluate their encodings using Cocon’s evaluation strategy.  
 I will conclude with highlighting more recent research directions and challenges that build on the core ideas of Cocon and aim to support meta-programming and intensional code analysis directly in System F and Martin-Löf type theory.  
 Bio    
 Brigitte Pientka a Full Professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill University. Her main research interests lie in developing theoretical foundations of programming languages. A central question of her work is: How can we design programming languages that ensure that programs are safe and have fewer bugs? In 2018, her work on the Beluga programming language has received the Test of Time Award from International Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming (PPDP).  
 Brigitte Pientka is a leader within the programming languages research community, and serves for example on the SIGPLAN executive committee. In particular, she is passionate about working towards overcoming systemic barriers for underrepresented groups. In 2018, she co-founded the Women in Logic workshop which provides valuable networking opportunity to female researchers and as the general chair for POPL in 2020 she introduced Mentoring Breakfasts which now are a fixture at SIGPLAN events.  

 The Missing Diagonal: High Level Languages for Low Level Systems    
   Satnam Singh    
 The computing community has produced many high level languages and tools for programming high level systems (e.g. Java for user interfaces) and it has produced many low level languages and tools for programming low level systems (C for operating systems, Verilog for hardware design) yet there are not many examples of high level systems that have been produced to help develop low level systems. Sometimes this is due to a suspicion that the layers of abstraction that high level systems use incur unacceptable performance overheads. However, this talk attempts to challenge that view, giving examples of high level systems that improve the designer productivity for developing low level systems which also improve the quality of verification for low level systems.  
 The talk will draw examples from the presenter’s own experience, as well as the work of others. Specific examples will include Lava and Bluespec for the design of hardware, the Silver Oak project for the co-design of a high assurance silicon root of trust, a Haskell-based DSL for programming machine learning chips, and recent work on the specification and verification of parts of a new silicon chip produced at Groq which makes use of the same Haskell DSL.  
 Bio    
 Satnam Singh is a Fellow at Groq where he applies the power of functional programming languages to the design of machine learning chips and their programming models. Satnam Singh previously worked at Google (machine learning chips, cluster management), Facebook (Android optimization), Microsoft (parallel and concurrent programming) and Xilinx (Lava DSL for hardware design). He started his career as an academic at the University of Glasgow (FPGA-based application acceleration and functional programming).

 POPL 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2025 will be invited to present their work in the POPL conference in January 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
 Scope   
 Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing technical papers can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  .  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 POPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process (similar to the one used for POPL 2023 and 2024 but different from the lightweight double-blind process used in previous years). This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers. The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences for authors.  
 Submissions:  Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions. In addition, references to authors’ own prior work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  Supplementary material:  Authors are permitted to provide supplementary material (e.g., detailed proofs, proof scripts, system implementations, or experimental data) along with their submission, which reviewers may (but are not required to) examine. This material may take the form of a single file, such as a PDF or a tarball. Authors must fully anonymize any supplementary material. 
  Author response:  In responding to reviews, authors should not say anything that reveals their identity, since author identities will not be revealed to reviewers at that stage of the reviewing process. 
  Dissemination of work under submission:  Authors are welcome to disseminate their ideas and post draft versions of their paper(s) on their personal website, institutional repository, or arXiv (reviewers will be asked to turn off arXiv notifications during the review period). But authors should not take steps that would almost certainly reveal their identities to members of the Program Committee, e.g., directly contacting PC members or publicizing the work on widely-visible social media or major mailing lists used by the community. 
  The purpose of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors’ identities if they were to try. In particular, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the quality of the submission.  
 However, there are occasionally cases where adhering to the above restrictions is truly difficult or impossible for one reason or another. In such cases, the authors should contact the Program Chair  to discuss the situation and how to handle it.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  addresses many common scenarios and answers many common questions about this topic. But there remain many grey areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules or you encounter a complex case that is not clearly covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Evaluation Process   
 Like last year, POPL 2025 will use a double-blind reviewing process (instead of the lightweight double-blind process used in recent years). This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. For authors, the main change is that there is no option to upload non-anonymized supplementary material; only anonymized supplementary material may be submitted.  
 POPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.  
 As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.  
 The Review Committee (RC) will discuss papers electronically, and will use synchronous virtual meetings to discuss any papers for which there is disagreement among reviewers, in some cases soliciting additional input from other experts in the committee. There is no formal External Review Committee, though experts outside the committee may be consulted for some papers. Reviews will be accompanied by a short summary of the reasons behind the committee’s decision with the goal of clarifying the reasons behind the decision.  
 To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL papers will be conditionally accepted; authors will be required to submit a short description of the changes made to the final version of the paper, including how the changes address any requirements imposed by the Review Committee. That the changes are sufficient will be confirmed by the original reviewers prior to acceptance to POPL. Authors of conditionally accepted papers must submit a satisfactory revision to the Review Committee by the requested deadline or risk rejection.  
 For additional information about the reviewing process, see: Principles of POPL  , a presentation of the underlying organizational and reviewing policies for POPL. For POPL 2025, policies specified in this Call for Papers supersede those in the Principles of POPL document.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://popl25.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Program Chair (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM July 11, 2024 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Conflicts of Interest   
 For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as “Other Conflicts (external)”. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace.  
 Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and proposals; for two years), between people at the same institution (branches of large companies or different locations of research institutes are considered to be the same institution; for two years after leaving an institution), between people with financial conflicts of interest, and between friends or relatives.  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.  
 Submission Guidelines   
 Prior to the paper submission deadline, authors should upload their full anonymized paper. Here are some key requirements concerning paper submissions:  
 Each paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the acmart  LaTeX class with acmsmall  option). It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent POPL page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. The PACMPL template for LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page  , and further information about PACMPL submissions can be found on the PACMPL author guidelines page  . PACMPL does not support submissions in Microsoft Word. 
  We strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options in order to make submissions easier to review. 
  ( NEW this year  ) Authors may choose which citation format they wish to use, which can be either author-year (the mandate for final versions in previous years) or numeric. 
  Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. 
  Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy  and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism  . Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed. 
  Authors are free to submit supplementary material along with their submissions, but it must be fully anonymized. 
  Authors must list all their conflicts of interest (both PC conflicts and external conflicts) in the HotCRP submission form. 
  Authors may include additional information in a field of the HotCRP submission form labeled “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair”. This information need not be anonymized. It can be used to inform the Program Chair, for example, about sensitive issues concerning a conflict with a PC member or about supplementary material that cannot be anonymized. It is left to the discretion of the Program Chair what to do with this information. 
  If for some reason an author feels uncomfortable discussing a sensitive issue with the Program Chair (or communicating via the “Confidential Comments” field in HotCRP), they should feel free to get in touch instead with any of the Associate Chairs, with whom they can discuss the issue in confidence. 
  Submissions from PC members (except the Program Chair) are permitted and will not be handled any differently than other submissions. This is in accordance with a recent change in policy approved by the SIGPLAN Executive Committee: SIGPLAN conferences that use full double-blind review and whose PCs have at least 50 members need not hold PC submissions to a higher standard. 
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact submission is strongly encouraged but voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Copyright, Publication, and Presentation   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license  , which grants readers liberal (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a | Creative Commons license | , retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Authors of accepted papers are encouraged (but not required) to give a short talk (roughly 25 minutes long) at the conference, according to the conference schedule.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:   
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 At most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The selection of the distinguished papers will be made based on the final version of the paper and through an additional review process.  

 FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing  
   
 General   
 Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?   
 A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such, possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science conferences have embraced double-blind reviewing. POPL has used double-blind reviewing for several years now as stipulated in the Principles of POPL  .  
 Q: Why are you using full  double-blind reviewing instead of lightweight  double-blind reviewing?   
 A: For about a decade, POPL used lightweight double-blind review (double-blind until PC members submit reviews). For POPL 2023, the conference switched to full double-blind review (double-blind until conditional acceptance). There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches, but based on our experience so far, the benefits of full-double blind seem to outweight the drawbacks.  
 Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   
 A: It is relatively rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  
 Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors and not previously published?   
 A: Yes, but we have mechanisms in place to prevent such an injustice from occurring. Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information. The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers accountable for claims that may be incorrect. Moreover, if authors believe that their paper is being misjudged due to the constraints of double-blind review, they should feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair.  
 For authors   
 Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   
 A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity, and avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which the work was performed.  
 If you believe for some reason that it is impossible to anonymize your paper without significantly weakening it, please feel free to get in touch with the Program Chair to discuss the situation.  
 Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   
 A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-blind guidelines.  
 Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository or I would like to provide a link to an online demo. How do I deal with this?   
 A: We discourage the use of external links, but sometimes the most convenient way to share suplementary material such as code or datasets is to include a link to a github repository or a google drive, but it is very important that they are fully anonymized. In particular, a link to your working code repository that exposes the identities of the contributors will be in violation of the double blind policy.  
 The same holds for online demos; reviewers should be able to visit the online demo and potentially browse its source code without being exposed to the identity of the authors (watch out for copyright statements, for example).  
 You should keep in mind that reviewers are under no obligation to review any supplementary material, including externally linked data or code, and reviewers may chose not to visit any externally linked material.  
 Needless to say, attempting to discover the reviewers for your paper by tracking visitors to a public repository or an online demo would constitute a breach of academic integrity.  
 Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?   
 A: No. The relationship between systems and authors changes over time, so there will be at least some doubt about authorship. Increasing this doubt by changing the system name would help with anonymity, but it would compromise the research process. In particular, changing the name requires explaining a lot about the system again because you can’t just refer to the existing papers, which use the proper name. Not citing these papers runs the risk of the reviewers who know about the existing system thinking you are replicating earlier work. It is also confusing for the reviewers to read about the paper under Name X and then have the name be changed to Name Y. Will all the reviewers go and re-read the final version with the correct name? If not, they have the wrong name in their heads, which could be harmful in the long run.  
 Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   
 A: If the previous workshop publication resulted in a published paper, then your POPL submission will be judged on the significance of its delta with respect to that earlier paper. In that case, you should definitely cite the earlier paper as you would any other paper (i.e., in the third person, not revealing that you were the author of the earlier paper) and explain the delta. If, on the other hand, the work presented at an earlier workshop was not accompanied by a proper publication (e.g., if it was just a talk), then your POPL submission may very well have significant overlap with it and citing the workshop work would effectively unblind your paper. In such a case, it is not necessary to cite the earlier presentation. Instead, please mention it in the “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair” field of the HotCRP form so that the Program Chair is aware of the situation. When in doubt, ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: I want to cite some related work that itself cites an earlier version of my paper/system that appeared previously online. But that would effectively unblind my submission. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: My submission presents a technique that I employed in the development of previous papers but which was never properly described in those papers. If I mention that my technique was used in those previous papers, I am effectively unblinding my submission, but if I don’t mention it, reviewers may think I am ripping off my own prior work. What do I do?   
 A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the Program Chair for guidance.  
 Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?   
 A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between (1) the normal communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should not impede, and (2) actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  
 Things you may  do:  
 Submit your paper to POPL, even if a previous version of it – under the same title or a different title – has been presented at an informal workshop, published on arXiv, or submitted to a previous conference or workshop. 
  Post your submission on your home page, your institutional repository, or arXiv, before or after the deadline (under whatever title you want). 
  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the PC, or with PC members with whom you already have a conflict. 
  Present your work at professional meetings, informal workshops, or job interviews during the POPL review period. 
  The above is not an exhaustive list: when in doubt, ask the Program Chair.  
 Things you should not  do:  
 Contact PC members (with whom you are not conflicted) about your work. 
  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). 
  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, POPL paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. 
  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Chair.  
 Q: Will the fact that POPL is double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of-interest?   
 A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the call for papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict.  
 For reviewers   
 Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective POPL author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?   
 A: You should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, as explained above, it is fine for authors to give talks about their work (at workshops, job interviews, etc.), they cannot control who will attend their talks, and you as a PC member should not feel that you are prevented from attending their talks. Knowing (for whatever reason) that a paper was written by a certain author does not prevent you from reviewing the paper.  
 That said, if you feel that the authors’ actions are in flagrant violation of double-blind review, that is a point of concern. For example, if an author e-mails you their brand new POPL submission and asks to visit your institution to discuss it, that would clearly not be appropriate. There is a grey zone here, so use your best judgment, and when in doubt, ask the Program Chair how to proceed.  
 Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   
 A: You are under no obligation to follow any URLs to external supplementary material. If the submission is not self contained and does not convince you by itself about its merits, then the paper should not be accepted. If you ever have reason to suspect that your anonymity was compromised through your following of a link, please share that information with the PC chair immediately, as this would constitute a breach of academic integrity on the part of the authors.  
 Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   
 A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some papers, e.g., you don’t feel completely qualified to review them, or if you know someone who would be the perfect reviewer for the paper, then bring this to the attention of the Associate Chair handling your paper, and discuss with them potential external reviewers (or other PC members) who might be able to provide an expert review. Then, submit a review for the paper that is as careful as possible, pointing out the areas where you think your knowledge is lacking. The Associate Chairs will manage the process of ensuring that papers receive sufficient expert reviews; please do not contact outside reviewers yourself.  
 Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   
 A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system. It is critical that you enter these at least a week before the POPL submission deadline. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong personal friendship).  
 Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   
 A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, avoid using search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed.  
  These guidelines are largely based on guidelines for POPL 2023  , with a few modifications by Derek Dreyer based on discussions with the POPL Steering Committee. The earlier guidelines evolved from guidelines used at POPL and PLDI for a number of years, which originated in guidelines created by Mike Hicks for POPL 2012.

  The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation  (PEPM), which has a history going back to 1991 and has co-located with POPL every year since 2006, originates in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over the years, the scope of PEPM has expanded to include a variety of research areas centred around the theme of semantics-based program manipulation  — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Scope   
 In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2019 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:  
 Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimisation. 
  Modelling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. 
  More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2019 include, but are not limited to:  
 Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. 
  Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. 
  Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. 
  Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. 
  This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme co-chairs, Manuel Hermenegildo ( http://cliplab.org/herme/  ) and Atsushi Igarashi ( http://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/  ).  
 Submission categories and guidelines   
 Two kinds of submissions will be accepted: Regular Research Papers and Short Papers.  
 Regular Research Papers should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  Short Papers may include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at:  
 http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   
 and submitted electronically via HotCRP:  
 https://pepm19.hotcrp.com/   
 PEPM 2019 will employ lightweight double-blind reviewing according to the rules of POPL 2019. Quoting from POPL 2019’s call for papers:  
 “submitted papers must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and institutions must be omitted, and | references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.”  
 See POPL 2019’s Submission and Reviewing FAQ page for more information:  
 https://popl19.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2019-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ   
 Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs) provided that there are non-PC co-authors.  
 Accepted papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors of short papers, however, can ask for their papers to be left out of the formal proceedings.  
 At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop and present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected. Suggested topics, evaluation criteria, and writing guidelines for both research tool demonstration papers will be made available on the PEPM 2019 web site.  
 Student participants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details on the PAC programme, see its web page.  
 Important dates   
 Paper submission deadline : | Friday 19th October 2018 | (AoE) 
  Author notification : Monday 12th November 2018 (AoE) 
  Workshop : Monday 14th-Tuesday 15th January 2019 
  The proceedings are expected to be published 2 weeks pre-conference.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Best paper award   
 PEPM 2019 continues the tradition of a Best Paper award. The winner will be announced at the workshop.

 Call for Posters/Demos  
  
 To maintain PEPM’s dynamic and interactive nature, PEPM 2019 will continue to have special sessions for poster/demo presentations. In addition to the main interactive poster/demo session, there will also be a scheduled short-talk session where each poster/demo can be advertised to the audience in, say, 5–10 minutes.  
 Poster/demo abstracts should describe work relevant to PEPM (whose scope can be found in the Call for Papers  ), typeset as a one-page PDF using the two-column sigplan  sub-format of the new acmart  format available at:  
 http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   
  
 and sent by email to the programme co-chairs, Atsushi Igarashi and Manuel Hermenegildo, at:  
 igarashi at kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp, manuel.hermenegildo at imdea.org  
  
 Please also include in the email:  
 a short summary of the abstract (in plain text), 
  the type(s) of proposed presentation (poster and/or demo), and 
  whether you would like to give a scheduled short talk (in addition to the poster/demo presentation). 
  Abstracts should be sent no later than:  
 Friday, 14th December 2018, anywhere on earth   
  
 and will be considered for acceptance on a rolling basis. Accepted abstracts, along with their short summary, will be posted on this website.  
 At least one author of each accepted abstract must attend the workshop and present the work during the poster/demo session.  
 Student participants with accepted posters/demos can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details on the PAC programme, see its web page.

  The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation  (PEPM), which has a history going back to 1991 and has co-located with POPL every year since 2006, originates in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over the years, the scope of PEPM has expanded to include a variety of research areas centred around the theme of semantics-based program manipulation  — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Scope   
 In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2019 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:  
 Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimisation. 
  Modelling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. 
  More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2019 include, but are not limited to:  
 Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. 
  Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. 
  Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. 
  Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. 
  This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme co-chairs, Manuel Hermenegildo ( http://cliplab.org/herme/  ) and Atsushi Igarashi ( http://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/  ).  
 Submission categories and guidelines   
 Two kinds of submissions will be accepted: Regular Research Papers and Short Papers.  
 Regular Research Papers should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  Short Papers may include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages (excluding bibliography). 
  Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at:  
 http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   
 and submitted electronically via HotCRP:  
 https://pepm19.hotcrp.com/   
 PEPM 2019 will employ lightweight double-blind reviewing according to the rules of POPL 2019. Quoting from POPL 2019’s call for papers:  
 “submitted papers must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and institutions must be omitted, and | references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
  The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.”  
 See POPL 2019’s Submission and Reviewing FAQ page for more information:  
 https://popl19.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2019-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ   
 Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs) provided that there are non-PC co-authors.  
 Accepted papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors of short papers, however, can ask for their papers to be left out of the formal proceedings.  
 At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop and present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected. Suggested topics, evaluation criteria, and writing guidelines for both research tool demonstration papers will be made available on the PEPM 2019 web site.  
 Student participants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details on the PAC programme, see its web page.  
 Important dates   
 Paper submission deadline : | Friday 19th October 2018 | (AoE) 
  Author notification : Monday 12th November 2018 (AoE) 
  Workshop : Monday 14th-Tuesday 15th January 2019 
  The proceedings are expected to be published 2 weeks pre-conference.  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  
 Best paper award   
 PEPM 2019 continues the tradition of a Best Paper award. The winner will be announced at the workshop.

 Call for Posters/Demos  
  
 To maintain PEPM’s dynamic and interactive nature, PEPM 2019 will continue to have special sessions for poster/demo presentations. In addition to the main interactive poster/demo session, there will also be a scheduled short-talk session where each poster/demo can be advertised to the audience in, say, 5–10 minutes.  
 Poster/demo abstracts should describe work relevant to PEPM (whose scope can be found in the Call for Papers  ), typeset as a one-page PDF using the two-column sigplan  sub-format of the new acmart  format available at:  
 http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   
  
 and sent by email to the programme co-chairs, Atsushi Igarashi and Manuel Hermenegildo, at:  
 igarashi at kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp, manuel.hermenegildo at imdea.org  
  
 Please also include in the email:  
 a short summary of the abstract (in plain text), 
  the type(s) of proposed presentation (poster and/or demo), and 
  whether you would like to give a scheduled short talk (in addition to the poster/demo presentation). 
  Abstracts should be sent no later than:  
 Friday, 14th December 2018, anywhere on earth   
  
 and will be considered for acceptance on a rolling basis. Accepted abstracts, along with their short summary, will be posted on this website.  
 At least one author of each accepted abstract must attend the workshop and present the work during the poster/demo session.  
 Student participants with accepted posters/demos can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North America and Europe.

 About The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PEPM) has a history going back to 1991 and has been held in conjunction with POPL every year since 2006. The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties. Scope In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular: Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimisation. Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2024 include, but are not limited to: Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme co-chairs, Guillaume Allais (guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk) and Annie Liu (liu@cs.stonybrook.edu). AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  Last updated by Dou Sun  in 2024-09-15

 Call for Papers  
 Overview  
 The 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS conference will be held at Stony Brook University, New York, USA, on June 9-13 2025.   
 We solicit papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems. A good submission typically focuses on a well-motivated problem in computer systems, proposes a principled solution using modeling, measurement, and performance analysis, and empirically validates the solution through simulations and/or implementation. The research may target systems in a broad range of domains, including networking, high-performance computing, machine learning, IoT, cloud, edge, multimedia, mobile, and cyber-physical systems. The work may target diverse system metrics such as latency, throughput, reliability, cost, accuracy, fairness, energy, and carbon footprint.  
   
  The conference presents papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). There are multiple deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below). A panel of reviewers will consider all accepted and eligible papers for the Best Paper Awards and the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award.

 Papers may be submitted to any deadline and, upon acceptance, papers will be scheduled for publication in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems  (POMACS) and presentation at the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. The journal publication of accepted papers will appear in the issue of POMACS immediately following acceptance; i.e., papers that are accepted for the Summer and Fall deadlines will appear in POMACS before the conference.  
 Submission Instructions  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:  
 Soft Tracking | : SIGMETRICS uses "soft" tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. For authors who have difficulty selecting a track, the PC chairs will be available to provide advice. The four tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS 2025 (for all three deadlines) are: 
  Learning. | Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, trustworthy learning (causality, fairness, privacy), and distributed learning, as well as their applications to systems. 
  Measurement & Applied Modeling. | Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena. Papers in this track may present general-purpose measurement or simulation methodologies, or may focus on a specific application domain, or a particular technology, and explain data obtained from measurements of that domain or technology. 
  Systems. | Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. A good submission to this track will make a contribution to the modeling and performance analysis of the system prior to empirical validation. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to networking, distributed systems computer architecture, wireless networks, edge/IoT applications, high-performance computing, cloud computing, energy efficiency, real-time and fault-tolerant computing, security and privacy, social networks,cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid. System papers with a strong machine learning and AI focus are encouraged to apply to the Learning track. 
  Theory. | Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new analysis techniques. The areas of interest include but are not limited to stochastic processes & applied probability, graph theory, scheduling & resource allocation, queueing theory, caching theory, algorithms, mathematical optimization, control theory, market design & game theory, privacy & security, network science, and algorithmic fairness. 
  In addition to tracks, authors must select one or more topics from a list provided in the submission site. 
  The submission may have up to 20 pages, in single-column | acmsmall template format | , for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained. However it may only be used for the purpose of justifying the technical correctness of the claims stated in the body of the paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. Note that the novelty of the submission will be judged based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. 
  Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the Policies section. 
  Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts include shared institutional affiliations, collaborations (joint research, authorship, or funding) that occurred in the last 24 months before the selected submission deadline or are expected in the near future, past or current PhD student/supervisor relationships, and close personal or family relationships. 
  Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below. 
  The Reviewing Process  
 Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:  
 Accept with Shepherding: | Every accepted paper will be shepherded in order to ensure that important suggestions from the reviewers are incorporated into the final version of the paper. 
  Reject: | If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper. 
  Resubmit: | For papers that are close to the acceptance threshold, but require a major revision prior to acceptance, the 12-month resubmission ban is waived and a resubmit option is offered. Authors may then resubmit a revision of the paper during one of the next three submission deadlines (this may fall into ACM SIGMETRICS 2026 deadlines). The revision will be treated the same as a new submission and may be reviewed by a different set of reviewers. 
  Policies  
 Anonymity guidelines: | ACM SIGMETRICS is double anonymous, meaning that authors should make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. Specifically, please take the following steps when preparing your submission: 
  Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
  Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
  Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. 
  Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
  If you need to reference another submission at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 on a related topic, reference it as follows: "A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2025]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2025] Under submission. Details omitted for double anonymous reviewing." 
  If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email. 
  Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline, as potential reviewers may be automatically notified (e.g., if subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers). In addition, authors should take care not to widely broadcast information about their arXiv submission, for example, on social media forums or a general press release or large mailing lists where PC members in the recipient list or audience can easily identify the authors. 
  PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of double anonymous reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs. 
  For accepted papers, it is expected that the list of authors will not change between the last submission and the final camera-ready copy. 
  The paper must have a | substantive title and abstract | . Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice. 
  Submissions must present | original research | . However, previous publication of preliminary work as an extended abstract at a workshop is acceptable as long as the submission includes substantial new material. Further, in such cases, authors should (i) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation, and (ii) explain the differences between the SIGMETRICS submission and the prior workshop paper. A rule of thumb is that a prior workshop publication should be at most 6 pages long, not including references. 
  It is ACM policy not to allow | simultaneous submissions | , where the same paper is concurrently submitted to more than one conference/journal. Any simultaneous submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved, and the authors may be blacklisted if multiple such violations are detected, including across conference editions. It is considered a simultaneous submission for a paper that is being considered for a one-shot revision to be submitted to another conference/journal before being withdrawn from the SIGMETRICS process. This applies to all papers, i.e., even authors who wish to opt out of POMACS can only submit to a journal after they have received a decision from SIGMETRICS. 
  All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process. The camera-ready paper must be approved by the shepherd for final publication prior to any upload to the ACM camera-ready management system. No unauthorized changes to the body of the paper or references are allowed in between shepherd approval and camera-ready upload. Violations will be investigated by the conference leadership and may lead to sanctions. 
  Authors have the option to "opt out" of publication in the ACM POMACS journal if they would like to publish their work in some other journal. Authors who choose this option must still present their work at the conference and undergo shepherding under the same terms as papers that will appear in ACM POMACS. Additionally, a 1-2 page extended abstract of the work must be included in Performance Evaluation Review. This abstract must contain a link to an online version of the full paper that will be maintained for at least 2 years. 
  For papers that decide to "opt out", an expedited review process of accepted papers will be provided by the following journals: ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems Elsevier Performance Evaluation, INFORMS Operations Research, Stochastic Models, and Stochastic Systems. In each case, after you have notified the TPC Chairs of your decision, you should prepare your manuscript using the same preparation guidelines as standard papers for the journals, indicate in the cover letter that the paper was published at SIGMETRICS, and submit the paper with an authors' response to the SIGMETRICS reviews. Note that, in all cases, the paper will undergo a separate reviewing process within these journals, and acceptance at SIGMETRICS does not guarantee acceptance of the journal submission. 
  Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
  To avoid any potential bias, the core conference organizers, including the General Chairs and Program Chairs, will not submit papers to any of the SIGMETRICS submission deadlines in this call for papers. PC members and other Organizing Committee members, however, are allowed to submit their papers. 
  Ethical Considerations  
 Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report  for further information on ethical principles, or the Allman/Paxson IMC '07 paper  for guidance on ethical data sharing.  
 Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient--in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC's review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness.  
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. In particular, authors must follow the basic research and publication principle outlined by the ACM Publication Board's Policies and Procedures  and the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  . Relevant policies regarding the publication and review processes include ACM's policies on coercion and abuse in the ACM publications process  , and on plagiarism misrepresentation, and falsification  .  
 Diversity and Inclusiveness  
 As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.  
 Inclusivity Guidelines  : Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions. Avoid gender-specific pronouns if possible. Where required, consider interspersing a balance of male ("he", "his"), female ("she", "her"), and gender-neutral ("they", "their") ones. 
  Use gender-neutral names in examples. Instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Esteban, Naveena, Sasha, Sergey, Tuan, Xin, and so on. 
  Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, the "gender" column in a table of data should have more than just "male" and "female" values. 
  Be mindful of people's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has two parents. Not every marriage involves "husband" and "wife". Not everyone lives in a house, or has a car. 
  Accessibility Guidelines:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on age color blindness, distance, visual acuity, etc. Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all by considering the following: Use patterns, symbols, and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures rather than using colors alone. Graphs should be readable either in monochrome or color versions. 
  Use a color palette that is designed for visually-impaired or color-blind people. Avoid poor color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple. 

  Contact the SIGMETRICS 2025 PC chairs at sigmetrics25tpcchairs@sigmetrics.org  in case of questions or concerns.

 CLICK HERE  to Download the PDF Version  of Call For Papers   
  IEEE PerCom, now in its 23 rd  year, will be held in Washington DC, USA, from March 17 to 21, 2025, as a physical event.  
 PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing is constantly at the forefront of mobile and ubiquitous systems research and has found its way into many commercial applications due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices.  
 Scope  
 PerCom 2025 solicits research contributions in all areas pertinent to pervasive computing and communications. In particular, PerCom targets contributions in:  
 Advances in pervasive systems and infrastructures: | middleware systems and services; data engineering for pervasive computing; cloud, fog and edge computing; integrations of smartphones and wearables in pervasive experiences; applications of device-to-device coordination. 
  Theories, models, and algorithms: | context modeling & reasoning; adaptive computing; activity & emotion recognition; programming paradigms; applied deep/federated/decentralized machine learning; causal learning; cognitive computing; resource-efficient AI; complex networks; spatio-temporal modeling. 
  Domain-specific challenges and novel applications: | urban/mobile crowdsensing & intelligence; PerCom for healthcare and well-being; cyber-physical PerCom; smart homes and virtual assistants; mixed reality; sports analytics; crime prevention; pervasive nowcasting; assistive and collaborative robotics; pervasive AR/VR; smart vehicles; disaster sensing and management; interactive agents; education and reskilling. 
  Intersections of PerCom with: | IoT and sensor systems; RFID; opportunistic networks; pervasive data science; human-machine interaction and interfaces, cyber-physical systems; 3D networks, embedded and edge AI. 
  New techniques for user-level concerns: | participatory and social sensing; trust, security, privacy, fairness, and ethics; user interface, interaction, and persuasion; online and offline social networking; human-machine collaboration. 
  Technological innovations: | architectures, protocols, and technologies for pervasive communications; energy-harvesting, self-powered, or battery-less systems; mobile and wearable systems; smart devices, natural multimodal interfaces and environments; positioning, navigation, timing, and tracking technologies; and device-free human and environmental sensing. 
  Contributions can be analytical, empirical, technological, methodological, or a combination. Papers reporting strong systems engineering contributions backed by solid and appropriate evaluations are strongly encouraged. The impact of the contributions should be demonstrated in the context of pervasive computing and communications applications.   
 Read Before Submitting   
 Note: accepted papers must be presented in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings, the conference program and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award.   
 We also strongly advise authors of submitted papers to be prepared to apply for their US visa as soon as their paper is accepted.   
 Important Dates  (Revised)

Papers reporting strong systems engineering contributions backed by solid and appropriate evaluations are strongly encouraged. The impact of the contributions should be demonstrated in the context of pervasive computing and communications applications.   
 Read Before Submitting   
 Note: accepted papers must be presented in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings, the conference program and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award.   
 We also strongly advise authors of submitted papers to be prepared to apply for their US visa as soon as their paper is accepted.   
 Important Dates  (Revised)  
 Paper registration in EasyChair (EXTENDED, FINAL and FIRM)  : Sunday Sep 29, 2024 11.59pm AOE  ( Sun, Sep 22, 2024, 11.59 pm AOE   )  
 Paper submission in EasyChair (EXTENDED, FINAL and FIRM)  : Friday, October 4, 2024, 11.59 pm AOE  ( Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 11.59 pm AOE   )  
 Notification: Friday, Dec 20 2024   
 Camera Ready: early-Feb 2025   
 Best Paper Award and Editorial Follow-Ups   
 The best paper will receive the prestigious Mark Weiser Best Paper Award.  
 Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a special issue of the  Pervasive and Mobile Computing Journal   .  
 Submission Details   
 Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events via EasyChair   . If you do not have an EasyChair account, please, register first and create an account (it’s free) via the following link: register  . The direct submission link for PerCom 2025 is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=percom2025  ; paper submission will be active from September 5. Select “ Research Track  ” from the list of tracks to submit papers to the main conference.  
 PerCom 2025 will follow a double-blind review process  . As a result, authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions. In particular, as in previous PerCom editions, publishing pre-prints of your submitted papers in online archives (e.g., arXiv) prior to submission does NOT disqualify the paper from consideration at PerCom. Moreover, we instruct reviewers NOT to go searching for pre-prints of submitted papers. However, papers that are judged not to have created a suitable double-blind version may be summarily rejected from further consideration.   
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and may not be under consideration elsewhere for publication at any point in the review process  . Also, they must show a significant relevance to pervasive computing and communications. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee. Only electronic submissions in PDF  format will be considered.  
 The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be found here  . Papers must be at most 9 pages of technical content  ( 10pt font, 2-column format  ), including text, figures, tables and appendices, and up to 1 additional page for references  only. Papers that violate the formatting instructions may be summarily rejected from further consideration.   
 Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.

 CFP–Special Issue on International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT 2024)   
   
 Parallel, distributed, and federated machine learning have emerged as prevalent paradigms in contemporary AI technology. The fusion of rapidly evolving machine learning techniques with the extensive literature on parallel and distributed computing has inspired many vivid research topics, including algorithm complexity, architecture, and privacy. Given that machine learning algorithms frequently demand significant computational resources, it becomes imperative to employ proficient parallel and distributed machine learning algorithms to expedite the execution time. Large amount of data communicates through the network during the parallel execution of machine learning algorithms. Consequently, there exists a pressing need for an efficient distributed parallel architecture to reduce the communication time, and also urgent demand for the mechanism to ensure the data privacy.  
  
 Fundamental challenges persist in these topics and many other related ones in algorithms, complexity, and applicational technologies in parallel and distributed machine learning. The objective of this special issue is to publish and overview recent trends in these interdisciplinary areas. We organize the conference of the 25th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT 2024), which will be held in Hongkong, China during December 14-16, 2024 ( https://hpcc.siat.ac.cn/meeting/pdcat2024/index.html  ). This conference is specialized in Parallel and Distributed Computing. Selected papers accepted by PDCAT 2024 will be recommended to this Special Issue on " Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies", which is also open to all high-quality initial-submitted papers.

 General information about PETs  Submit your paper    
 The annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)  brings together experts from around the world to present and discuss recent advances and new perspectives on research in privacy technologies. The 25th PETS will be a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Washington, DC, USA and a concurrent virtual event. Papers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies  (PoPETs). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to attend and present at the physical event, where their presentations can be recorded for the virtual event and where they can participate directly in in-person research, technical, and social activities. However, in-person attendance is not required for publication in the proceedings.  
 PoPETs, a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.  
 Authors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months and are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. Authors will receive a decision of accept, revise, or reject; those receiving revise will be invited to revise their article with the guidance of a revision editor according to a well-defined set of revision criteria and will have up to four months to attempt to complete the required revisions. Authors of rejected papers must skip a full issue prior to resubmission.  
 Submission Guidelines    
  The submission guidelines  contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions, for ensuring ethical research, and for using AI in writing or editing the manuscript. Papers must be submitted via the PETS 2025 submission server. The submission URL is: https://submit.petsymposium.org/  .

 Review Process (New for 2025)  
 Authors invited to revise their submissions will be provided with a set of revision criteria that must be satisfactorily completed before their paper can be accepted. Authors of such papers will not resubmit to the next issue, but will instead be assigned a revision editor who will guide the revision process by interactively reviewing new versions of the paper and providing feedback and guidance on the changes necessary for acceptance. Authors will be instructed to propose a revision schedule that is agreeable to the revision editor. Authors may complete the necessary changes as soon as is practical but no later than four months following the author notification deadline: revisions that are accepted by the revision editor within 1 month of the author notification will appear in that issue, while revisions that are accepted by the revision editor between 1-4 months of the author notification will appear in the following issue. Not all papers that receive a revise decision will be accepted: papers that do not adequately incorporate the required revisions by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. Please see the review process page  for more information.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)  
 Authors of rejected papers may consider resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs, but must skip one full issue before resubmission. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 1 may not be resubmitted until Issue 3 or later. This policy follows into future volumes as well. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 3 of Volume 2025 may not be resubmitted until Issue 1 of Volume 2026. This policy enables authors ample time to substantially improve their papers and helps mitigate the overburdening of reviewers.  
 Scope (New for 2025)  
 Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal or situational contexts in which they are used. PETS is also open to interdisciplinary research examining people’s and communities’ privacy needs preferences, and expectations as long as it is clear how these findings can impact the design, development, or deployment of technology with privacy implications.  
 Note that a paper's relevance to privacy applications  is crucial. PETS is open to topics from the wider area of security and privacy as long as it is clear how these serve to improve or understand privacy in technology (e.g., it includes a use case, evaluation on real data, integration with an application, etc.) in real systems. A paper that makes significant contributions in an area such as theoretical cryptography but fails to clearly tie its contributions to improving or understanding privacy in real systems  is unlikely to be accepted. The chairs and the program committee at their discretion, may reject papers based on scope  
 Clarification of expectations: This year we introduced a new requirement that submissions must contribute to real privacy applications that run in real systems. Consistent with this focus, we expect that submissions should not need to rely on proofs as a primary contribution and thus proofs would usually appear in the Appendix rather than in the main body, and a substantial portion of each submission would instead be focused on work that is more traditionally considered practical or applied work (e.g., real-world use cases, real-world measurements, evaluation on real-world data, application development, integration with a real-world application, system design and evaluation, etc.). This focus is necessary due to an increasing number of submissions that make primary contributions that are highly theoretical in nature (e.g., to theoretical cryptography and primitives or related areas) for which PoPETs is not well-equipped to review and provide high quality feedback.  
 Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:  
 Anonymous communication and censorship resistance 
  Blockchain privacy 
  Building and deploying privacy-enhancing systems 
  Cloud computing and privacy 
  Compliance with privacy laws and regulations 
  Cryptographic tools for privacy 
  Data protection technologies 
  Defining and quantifying privacy 
  Differential privacy and private data analysis 
  Economics and game-theoretical approaches to privacy 
  Forensics and privacy 
  Genomic and medical privacy 
  Human factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies 
  Information leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy 
  Interdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc. 
  Internet of Things privacy 
  Location privacy 
  Machine learning and privacy 
  Measurement of privacy in real-world systems 
  Mobile devices and privacy 
  Policy languages and tools for privacy 
  Profiling and data mining 
  Social network privacy 
  Surveillance 
  Traffic analysis 
  Transparency, fairness, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems 
  Web privacy 
  We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)  papers on any of these topics: papers putting together existing knowledge under some common light (adversary model, requirements, functionality offered, etc.), providing novel insights, identifying research gaps or challenges to commonly held assumptions, etc. Survey papers, without such contributions, are not suitable. SoK submissions should include "SoK:" in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.

 25th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2025)  
 July 14–19, 2025  
 Washington, DC and Online  
   
 General information about PETs  Submit your paper    
 The annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)  brings together experts from around the world to present and discuss recent advances and new perspectives on research in privacy technologies. The 25th PETS will be a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Washington, DC, USA and a concurrent virtual event. Papers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies  (PoPETs). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to attend and present at the physical event, where their presentations can be recorded for the virtual event and where they can participate directly in in-person research, technical, and social activities. However, in-person attendance is not required for publication in the proceedings.  
 PoPETs, a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.  
 Authors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months and are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. Authors will receive a decision of accept, revise, or reject; those receiving revise will be invited to revise their article with the guidance of a revision editor according to a well-defined set of revision criteria and will have up to four months to attempt to complete the required revisions. Authors of rejected papers must skip a full issue prior to resubmission.  
 Submission Guidelines    
  The submission guidelines  contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions, for ensuring ethical research, and for using AI in writing or editing the manuscript. Papers must be submitted via the PETS 2025 submission server. The submission URL is: https://submit.petsymposium.org/  .

 Review Process (New for 2025)  
 Authors invited to revise their submissions will be provided with a set of revision criteria that must be satisfactorily completed before their paper can be accepted. Authors of such papers will not resubmit to the next issue, but will instead be assigned a revision editor who will guide the revision process by interactively reviewing new versions of the paper and providing feedback and guidance on the changes necessary for acceptance. Authors will be instructed to propose a revision schedule that is agreeable to the revision editor. Authors may complete the necessary changes as soon as is practical but no later than four months following the author notification deadline: revisions that are accepted by the revision editor within 1 month of the author notification will appear in that issue, while revisions that are accepted by the revision editor between 1-4 months of the author notification will appear in the following issue. Not all papers that receive a revise decision will be accepted: papers that do not adequately incorporate the required revisions by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. Please see the review process page  for more information.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)  
 Authors of rejected papers may consider resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs, but must skip one full issue before resubmission. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 1 may not be resubmitted until Issue 3 or later. This policy follows into future volumes as well. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 3 of Volume 2025 may not be resubmitted until Issue 1 of Volume 2026. This policy enables authors ample time to substantially improve their papers and helps mitigate the overburdening of reviewers.  
 Scope (New for 2025)  
 Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal or situational contexts in which they are used. PETS is also open to interdisciplinary research examining people’s and communities’ privacy needs preferences, and expectations as long as it is clear how these findings can impact the design, development, or deployment of technology with privacy implications.  
 Note that a paper's relevance to privacy applications  is crucial. PETS is open to topics from the wider area of security and privacy as long as it is clear how these serve to improve or understand privacy in technology (e.g., it includes a use case, evaluation on real data, integration with an application, etc.) in real systems. A paper that makes significant contributions in an area such as theoretical cryptography but fails to clearly tie its contributions to improving or understanding privacy in real systems  is unlikely to be accepted. The chairs and the program committee at their discretion, may reject papers based on scope  
 Clarification of expectations: This year we introduced a new requirement that submissions must contribute to real privacy applications that run in real systems. Consistent with this focus, we expect that submissions should not need to rely on proofs as a primary contribution and thus proofs would usually appear in the Appendix rather than in the main body, and a substantial portion of each submission would instead be focused on work that is more traditionally considered practical or applied work (e.g., real-world use cases, real-world measurements, evaluation on real-world data, application development, integration with a real-world application, system design and evaluation, etc.). This focus is necessary due to an increasing number of submissions that make primary contributions that are highly theoretical in nature (e.g., to theoretical cryptography and primitives or related areas) for which PoPETs is not well-equipped to review and provide high quality feedback.  
 Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:  
 Anonymous communication and censorship resistance 
  Blockchain privacy 
  Building and deploying privacy-enhancing systems 
  Cloud computing and privacy 
  Compliance with privacy laws and regulations 
  Cryptographic tools for privacy 
  Data protection technologies 
  Defining and quantifying privacy 
  Differential privacy and private data analysis 
  Economics and game-theoretical approaches to privacy 
  Forensics and privacy 
  Genomic and medical privacy 
  Human factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies 
  Information leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy 
  Interdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc. 
  Internet of Things privacy 
  Location privacy 
  Machine learning and privacy 
  Measurement of privacy in real-world systems 
  Mobile devices and privacy 
  Policy languages and tools for privacy 
  Profiling and data mining 
  Social network privacy 
  Surveillance 
  Traffic analysis 
  Transparency, fairness, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems 
  Web privacy 
  We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)  papers on any of these topics: papers putting together existing knowledge under some common light (adversary model, requirements, functionality offered, etc.), providing novel insights, identifying research gaps or challenges to commonly held assumptions, etc. Survey papers, without such contributions, are not suitable. SoK submissions should include "SoK:" in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.

 25th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2025)  
 July 14–19, 2025  
 Washington, DC and Online  
   
 General information about PETs  Submit your paper    
 The annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)  brings together experts from around the world to present and discuss recent advances and new perspectives on research in privacy technologies. The 25th PETS will be a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Washington, DC, USA and a concurrent virtual event. Papers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies  (PoPETs). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to attend and present at the physical event, where their presentations can be recorded for the virtual event and where they can participate directly in in-person research, technical, and social activities. However, in-person attendance is not required for publication in the proceedings.  
 PoPETs, a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.  
 Authors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months and are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. Authors will receive a decision of accept, revise, or reject; those receiving revise will be invited to revise their article with the guidance of a revision editor according to a well-defined set of revision criteria and will have up to four months to attempt to complete the required revisions. Authors of rejected papers must skip a full issue prior to resubmission.  
 Submission Guidelines    
  The submission guidelines  contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions, for ensuring ethical research, and for using AI in writing or editing the manuscript. Papers must be submitted via the PETS 2025 submission server. The submission URL is: https://submit.petsymposium.org/  .

 Review Process (New for 2025)  
 Authors invited to revise their submissions will be provided with a set of revision criteria that must be satisfactorily completed before their paper can be accepted. Authors of such papers will not resubmit to the next issue, but will instead be assigned a revision editor who will guide the revision process by interactively reviewing new versions of the paper and providing feedback and guidance on the changes necessary for acceptance. Authors will be instructed to propose a revision schedule that is agreeable to the revision editor. Authors may complete the necessary changes as soon as is practical but no later than four months following the author notification deadline: revisions that are accepted by the revision editor within 1 month of the author notification will appear in that issue, while revisions that are accepted by the revision editor between 1-4 months of the author notification will appear in the following issue. Not all papers that receive a revise decision will be accepted: papers that do not adequately incorporate the required revisions by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. Please see the review process page  for more information.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)  
 Authors of rejected papers may consider resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs, but must skip one full issue before resubmission. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 1 may not be resubmitted until Issue 3 or later. This policy follows into future volumes as well. For example, papers that are rejected from Issue 3 of Volume 2025 may not be resubmitted until Issue 1 of Volume 2026. This policy enables authors ample time to substantially improve their papers and helps mitigate the overburdening of reviewers.  
 Scope (New for 2025)  
 Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal or situational contexts in which they are used. PETS is also open to interdisciplinary research examining people’s and communities’ privacy needs preferences, and expectations as long as it is clear how these findings can impact the design, development, or deployment of technology with privacy implications.  
 Note that a paper's relevance to privacy applications  is crucial. PETS is open to topics from the wider area of security and privacy as long as it is clear how these serve to improve or understand privacy in technology (e.g., it includes a use case, evaluation on real data, integration with an application, etc.) in real systems. A paper that makes significant contributions in an area such as theoretical cryptography but fails to clearly tie its contributions to improving or understanding privacy in real systems  is unlikely to be accepted. The chairs and the program committee at their discretion, may reject papers based on scope  
 Clarification of expectations: This year we introduced a new requirement that submissions must contribute to real privacy applications that run in real systems. Consistent with this focus, we expect that submissions should not need to rely on proofs as a primary contribution and thus proofs would usually appear in the Appendix rather than in the main body, and a substantial portion of each submission would instead be focused on work that is more traditionally considered practical or applied work (e.g., real-world use cases, real-world measurements, evaluation on real-world data, application development, integration with a real-world application, system design and evaluation, etc.). This focus is necessary due to an increasing number of submissions that make primary contributions that are highly theoretical in nature (e.g., to theoretical cryptography and primitives or related areas) for which PoPETs is not well-equipped to review and provide high quality feedback.  
 Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:  
 Anonymous communication and censorship resistance 
  Blockchain privacy 
  Building and deploying privacy-enhancing systems 
  Cloud computing and privacy 
  Compliance with privacy laws and regulations 
  Cryptographic tools for privacy 
  Data protection technologies 
  Defining and quantifying privacy 
  Differential privacy and private data analysis 
  Economics and game-theoretical approaches to privacy 
  Forensics and privacy 
  Genomic and medical privacy 
  Human factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies 
  Information leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy 
  Interdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc. 
  Internet of Things privacy 
  Location privacy 
  Machine learning and privacy 
  Measurement of privacy in real-world systems 
  Mobile devices and privacy 
  Policy languages and tools for privacy 
  Profiling and data mining 
  Social network privacy 
  Surveillance 
  Traffic analysis 
  Transparency, fairness, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems 
  Web privacy 
  We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)  papers on any of these topics: papers putting together existing knowledge under some common light (adversary model, requirements, functionality offered, etc.), providing novel insights, identifying research gaps or challenges to commonly held assumptions, etc. Survey papers, without such contributions, are not suitable. SoK submissions should include "SoK:" in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.

  PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers. This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions are requested from authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.  
 Possible artifacts include (but are not limited to):  
 Source code (e.g., system implementations, proof of concepts) 
  Datasets (e.g., network traces, raw study data) 
  Scripts for data processing or simulations 
  Machine-generated proofs 
  Formal specifications 
  Build environments (e.g., VMs, Docker containers, configuration scripts) 
   
 Artifacts are evaluated by the artifact review committee. The committee evaluates the artifacts to ensure that they provide an acceptable level of utility, and feedback is given to the authors. Issues considered include software bugs, readability of documentation and appropriate licensing. After your artifact has been approved by the committee, we will accompany the paper link on petsymposium.org  with a link to the artifact along with an artifact badge so that interested readers can find and use your artifact.  
 Caspar Bowden Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies    
  You are invited to submit nominations for the 2025 Caspar Bowden Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies. The Caspar Bowden PET award is presented annually to researchers who have made an outstanding contribution to the theory, design implementation, or deployment of privacy enhancing technologies. It is awarded at PETS and carries a cash prize as well as a physical award statue. Any paper by any author written in the area of privacy enhancing technologies is eligible for nomination. However, the paper must have appeared in a refereed journal conference, or workshop with proceedings published in the period from April 1 2023 until March 30, 2025.  
 Andreas Pfitzmann Best Student Paper Award   
  A winner of the Andreas Pfitzmann PETS 2025 Best Student Paper Award will be selected at PETS 2025. Papers written solely or primarily by a student who is presenting the work to PETS 2025 are eligible for the award.  
 Artifact Award   
  A winner of the PETS 2025 Artifact Award will be announced at PETS 2025. Artifacts for papers accepted to PETS 2025 are eligible for the award.  
 HotPETs and FOCI   
  As with the last several years, part of the symposium will be devoted to HotPETs — the "hottest," most exciting research ideas still in a still in a formative state — and FOCI, a workshop showcasing the latest results from the Free and Open Communication on the Internet community. Further information will be published on the PETS website in early 2025.

 The web site of the 46th International Conference on Theory and Application of Petri Nets and Concurrency  conference is now online http://conf-2025.petrinet.net/   

 The 45th International Conference on Theory and Application of Petri Nets and Concurrency conference will be organised by the SMV (Semantics, Modeling and Verification) team at the Computer Science Department of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, jointly with members of the Centre Universitaire d’Informatique. The conference will take place at the Campus Biotech Geneva. The Campus Biotech is an institution hosting research institutes and biotechnology companies. The Campus Biotech is a part of the Swiss Innovation Park.  
 The language of the conference is English, and its proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Papers presenting original research on application or theory of Petri nets, as well as contributions addressing topics relevant to the general field of distributed and concurrent systems or focused on applications of concurrency to system design are sought.  
 All accepted papers will be considered for an Outstanding Paper award. Authors of selected papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an extended version that will be further reviewed for inclusion into a special issue of a renowned journal.
