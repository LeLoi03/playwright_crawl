  Speech Abstract:  Video in the form of image sequences, which lose the temporal process of the photons flow, leads to an irreconcilable dilemma between high-dynamic and high-speed imaging. Based on the fact that the pixels of the photoelectric sensor are indepen⁃ dent, a new continuous photographing principle is invented: for each pixel, accumulate charge from the reset state, generate a spike as a flag once the specified threshold is reached, reset and repeat. The duration that a spike takes to be fired is called its spiking width, which is inversely proportional to the light intensity during this period. Based on this, the light intensity during this period can be estimated. The array of the spike sequences of all pixels is so-called “viform”, which contains rich spatial and temporal information of the light process. A n image at any moment can be calculated from viform, thereby ultrahigh-speed, high-dynamic and non-blurred continuous im⁃ aging achieved.Employing mature CMOS photonic devices and standard processes, two spike continuous photographing chips and spike cameras with spatial resolutions of 0.1 million and 1 million pixels have been developed, respectively. Viform will fundamentally reshapes computer vision and visual information processing technology and industries. An open source algorithm framework, SpikeCV, achieves high-speed target detection, tracking, and recognition system that is faster than the human eye by thousands of times, with low computational complexity.

  Speech Abstract:  Machine Unlearning.  
  Big data has been one of the important enablers of the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence. Its use for training machine learning models has enabled many useful applications. However, there are also some downsides when the data contains sensitive, often personal, information. Recent privacy and data protection regulations across the world have recognized the “right to be forgotten” as a fundamental right of citizens. Enabling this in practice not only requires deletion of data from institutional databases but also necessitates deletion of data from trained machine learning models. Machine Unlearning refers to the process of selectively removing or forgetting some specific data or a class of data from a machine learning (often deep learning) model. This talk will introduce the emerging field of machine unlearning, discuss the motivations behind it, the techniques employed, and its implications for data privacy, fairness, and interpretability. We will present several approaches for unlearning, including the selective modification of model parameters, regularization techniques, data-free methods, and teacher-student frameworks. We will then discuss the challenges and open research questions in the field. Machine Unlearning can thus be seen to contribute towards building more accountable AI systems that can engender trust among users and stakeholders.

  Speech Abstract:  Tracing the Evolution of Face Recognition Technology.  
  Face recognition is one of computer vision's most active and successful areas, with various applications, including security, surveillance, and social media. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of face recognition algorithms, which can now achieve high accuracy even on challenging datasets. However, several challenges still need to be addressed before face recognition can be widely deployed in real-world applications. This keynote will discuss the state of the art in face recognition, focusing on facial analysis and the challenges that remain. In the first part of the talk, we will review recent advances in face detection, facial attribute recognition, and other facial analysis tasks. We will also discuss the impact of these advances on applications such as security and surveillance. In the second part of the talk, we will discuss the challenges that remain in face recognition. These challenges include face recognition in low-quality images, explainability, fairness, social relationships, and ethics. We will discuss the current state of research on these challenges and propose potential directions for future work. .

  Speech Abstract:  See the unseen – we cannot automate what we cannot see in agriculture and aquaculture.  
  The recent explosion of AI/ML/Vision algorithm accuracy, efficiency and low processing cost has suddenly enabled applications undreamt of even five years ago – especially for challenging outdoor agritech applications. Our research is interested in these real-world applications, such as rapid data reduction of petabytes of data from scanning a farm (such as orchards or vineyards) from sub-mm under-canopy/underwater proximal sensing. We cannot automate what we cannot see – so our recent breakthroughs with NeRF and Gaussian splatting is helping to solve leaf occlusion to enable a rapid uptake of agricultural automation. I will describe our contributions across these research areas, including recent autonomous systems research into drones pruning forests, robots pruning vineyards, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) inspecting mussel lines to detect invasive biofouling species and AUVs mapping the seabed to locate scallops. We will also discuss the challenges that remain and so propose potential directions for future work.

 PSC 2024 is the 27 th  Stringology conference. It is an international conference focusing on stringology and related areas. It is organized annually by the Prague Stringology Club  , a research group in the Department of Theoretical Computer Science  at the Faculty of Information Technology  , Czech Technical University in Prague  . The proceedings of recent conferences are indexed in DBLP  , Scopus  , and Web of Science  of Clarivate  .  
 Stringology is a part of algorithmic research that deals with the processing of text strings. It has existed for at least thirty years and developed into a respected subfield of its own. The last twenty years have produced an explosion of new results. This progress is due in part to the human genome effort, an area to which string algorithms can make important contributions. String processing extended into tree processing is called arbology.  
 The topics of the conference include but are not limited to: algorithms for pattern matching in strings, images and trees 
  data structures (automata, trees etc.) for pattern matching in strings, images and trees 
  coding and data compression 
  bioinformatics 
  information retrieval 
  string processing algorithms in databases 
  searching for regularities

 Conferences   

 StringMasters was founded to bring together string algorithm researchers at all levels (senior, junior, and especially graduate students) to study current problems of particular theoretical and practical interest. It is informal, with no scheduled presentations, and entirely dedicated to new research that results from the interaction between the participants.  
 Website   

 Usually, small impromptu groups of about 2 to 5 researchers are formed who have a common interest in the problem. Old collaborations are strengthened and new ones are established. The workshop is located in several meeting rooms to allow space for parallel working groups and for casual meetings.  
 All interested parties are welcome to participate.  

 There are no registration fees. To register, simply send an email to Jan.Holub@fit.cvut.cz  , including your name and affiliation.

  How are ratings calculated?   To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzes reviews to verify trustworthiness.

  Submission Guidelines  
 High-quality papers in all PST-related areas that, at the time of submission, are not under review and have not already been published or accepted for publication elsewhere are solicited. Authors MUST ensure to select the track (Privacy, Security, or Trust) most relevant to their research when submitting their paper. Accepted papers will be accepted as ‘regular’ papers up to 10 pages, or ‘short’ papers of up to 6 pages including references. Up to 2 additional pages will be allowed in each category with over-length charges. Every additional page has a cost of $100.00 (CND). The standard IEEE two-column conference format should be used for all submissions. IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings can be downloaded here. The conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore as in previous editions of the conference. At least one author of an accepted paper must register by July 1, 2025. Accepted (short or regular) papers will be published in the proceedings.   
   
  Double-blind Submission  
 Reviewing will be double-blind: the reviewers will not know the identities of the authors. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper. For effective anonymization please follow these guidelines:  
  Do not include any author's name or affiliation in the title. Do not include any acknowledgments. Refer to your own published work in the third person: use “In the previous work of Jones et al.”, not “In our previous work”. If you cite own papers that are not widely available (e.g., a paper currently under review), use anonymous author names in the citation, for example, an author of the form “A. Anonymous”.

  Submission Instructions  
 High-quality papers in all PST-related areas that, at the time of submission are not under review and have not already been published or accepted for publication elsewhere are solicited. Authors MUST ensure to select the track (Privacy, Security, or Trust) most relevant to their research when submitting their paper. Accepted papers will be accepted as ‘regular’ papers up to 10 pages, or ‘short’ papers of up to 5 pages. Up to 2 additional pages will be allowed in each category with over-length charges. Every additional page has a cost of $100.00 (CND). The standard IEEE two-column conference format should be used for all submissions. IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings can be downloaded here. The conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore as in previous editions of the conference.  
   
  Double-blind Submission  
 Reviewing will be double-blind: the reviewers will not know the identities of the authors. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper. For effective anonymization please follow these guidelines:  
  Do not include any author's name or affiliation in the title. Do not include any acknowledgments. Refer to your own published work in the third person: use “In the previous work of Jones et al.”, not “In our previous work”. If you cite own papers that are not widely available (e.g., a paper currently under review), use anonymous author names in the citation, for example, an author of the form “A. Anonymous”.

 Present CFP : 2025 
 The 17th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX’25) will take place in Madrid, Spain, from September 30 to October 2, 2025. This event will gather top experts from both academia and industry to showcase and discuss the latest research on multimedia quality, Quality of Experience (QoE), and User Experience (UX).  
   
  The topic of this year is "Thinking of a QoE (r)evolution". On the edge of QoMEX “coming of age”, it is time to rethink the purpose and methods of QoE research: cross-fertilizing with adjacent fields, reaching more diverse populations, or exploring novel techniques and paradigms.  
   
  Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers (up to 6 pages for technical content including figures and references, and one optional 7th page containing only references) or short/demo papers (3 +1 page of references) to the general track, dataset and tools track, or to special sessions. Each paper will undergo a double-blind review process. Accepted and presented papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published in IEEE Xplore.  
   
  The conference will be held in form of oral, poster and plenary sessions. The QoMEX 2024 organizing committee solicits contributions including, but not limited to topics:

 QRS 2025 Conference - IEEE International Conference on Software Security and Reliability  
 About QRS  
  This year is the 25th anniversary of the QRS Conference.  The first edition of the conference was held in Hong Kong, China in 2000 under the name of Asia-Pacific Conference on Quality Software. Since then, the conference has grown significantly. In 2015, the SERE conference (IEEE International Conference on Software Security and Reliability) and the QSIC conference (IEEE International Conference on Quality Software) were combined into a single conference, QRS, with Q   representing Quality   , R   for Reliability   , and S   for Security   . This conference gives engineers and scientists from both industry and academia a platform to present their ongoing work, relate their research outcomes and experiences, and discuss the best and most efficient techniques for the development of reliable, secure, and trustworthy systems. It also represents an excellent opportunity for the academic community to become more aware of subject areas critical to the software industry as practitioners bring their needs to the table. The 25th QRS conference will go back to the country where the first conference was organized. It will be in Hangzhou, China from July 16-20, 2025.

 QRS 2024 Conference - IEEE International Conference on Software Security and Reliability  
 About QRS  
  In 2015, the SERE conference (IEEE International Conference on Software Security and Reliability) and the QSIC conference (IEEE International Conference on Quality Software) were combined into a single conference, QRS, with Q   representing Quality   , R   for Reliability   , and S   for Security   . This conference gives engineers and scientists from both industry and academia a platform to present their ongoing work, relate their research outcomes and experiences, and discuss the best and most efficient techniques for the development of reliable, secure, and trustworthy systems. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the academic community to become more aware of subject areas critical to the software industry as practitioners bring their needs to the table. The 24th QRS conference will be held from July 1-5, 2024 in Cambridge, United Kingdom.

 Present CFP : 2025 
 The 17th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX’25) will take place in Madrid, Spain, from September 30 to October 2, 2025. This event will gather top experts from both academia and industry to showcase and discuss the latest research on multimedia quality, Quality of Experience (QoE), and User Experience (UX).  
   
  The topic of this year is "Thinking of a QoE (r)evolution". On the edge of QoMEX “coming of age”, it is time to rethink the purpose and methods of QoE research: cross-fertilizing with adjacent fields, reaching more diverse populations, or exploring novel techniques and paradigms.  
   
  Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers (up to 6 pages for technical content including figures and references, and one optional 7th page containing only references) or short/demo papers (3 +1 page of references) to the general track, dataset and tools track, or to special sessions. Each paper will undergo a double-blind review process. Accepted and presented papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published in IEEE Xplore.  
   
  The conference will be held in form of oral, poster and plenary sessions. The QoMEX 2024 organizing committee solicits contributions including, but not limited to topics:  
   
  Innovative Approaches and Paradigms in QoE Research  
   
  - Revolutionary and disruptive approaches in QoE research  
  - Novel paradigms for QoE assessment  
  - Quality of sustainable experiences (QoSE)  
  - QoE and the value of services  
   
  Foundations and Methodologies in QoE Research  
   
  - Multimedia QoE and User eXperience

 HOW TO GET TO BIALYSTOK?   
 For foreign participants, the most convenient way to get to Białystok are direct buses between the Warsaw Fryderyk Chopin Airport and Białystok bus terminal | (the duration of travel is from 2.30h to 3h). Buses are rather frequent, and practically starts from Warsaw at 6:15 and finish at 22:15. The bus terminal is located next to the train station - | please follow the purple line | ( | see the map... | ). The timetable is available at the following link: | https://www.busy-krk.pl/en/chopin-airport-bialystok/ | . | Tickets could be purchased online on the carriers websites | PlusBus | and | ŻakExpress | . 
  There are frequent direct trains from Warsaw to Bialystok. It is best to use the | on-line rail route planner | (leaving 'Warszawa Centralna' or 'Warszawa Lot. Chopina' arriving 'Bialystok'). 
  The simplest way to get to conference hotels from Bialystok Railway Station or Bialystok Bus Station is to take TAXI, which is not expensive (up to 5 Euro). | Below is the list of recommended carriers (taxis are marked with phone numbers): | Comfort Taxi, +48 800 111 111, +48 85 744 44 44

The primary goal of the conference is to bring together leading professionals and scientists in multimedia quality and user experience from around the world.  
 Prior events took place in Karlshamn, Ghent, Lippstadt, Montreal, Athlone, Berlin, Sardinia, Erfurt, Lisbon, Costa Navorino, Singapore, Klagenfurt am Wörthersee, Yara Valley, Mechelen, Trondheim, and San Diego.  
 Proposers are requested to submit by October 15th, 2023 (to be updated)   , addressing the following aspects:  
 Content and format 
  Team 
  Scheduling, location and budget planning 
  Paper review process 
  Diversity & inclusion 
  Contact and info: Lea.Skorin-Kapov@fer.hr  and christian.timmerer@aau.at   
 Content and Format  : Propose a clear format for the conference. The proponents are asked to suggest a three-day format. The format should combine focused theme topics with general topics of interest to the QoMEX audience, in addition to a social program.  
 Team  : Propose an organizing and a technical program committee. The proponents are asked to provide a list of key organizing committee members. The organizing committee should be international and should have proven experience in organizing other international conferences and events. An initial list of a technical program committee from which reviewers will be drawn should also be proposed.  
 Scheduling, Location, and Costs  : Propose a detailed plan and budget. Proponents are encouraged to select a location that is easily accessible. The characteristics of the venue and associated costs should be included. In particular, a budget for a 50/75/100/125 person conference should be presented, as well as handling procedure for deficit/profit. The prepared budget needs to include an admin fee of 5% of the collected registration fees, or $30 per individual registration. A template can be provided upon request.  
 Paper Review  : Propose solutions for the review process. A system wherein four or more primary reviewers for each paper can be handled should be proposed. The proposal should estimate how many reviewers will be needed and indicate how and how many additional good quality reviewers outside the technical program committee will be recruited. The proponents are expected to build a database of reliable and good-quality reviewers, which can be enhanced upon the previous years’ reviewers’ database.  
 Diversity & Inclusion  : QoMEX is deeply committed to providing a respectful and inclusive environment for exchanging ideas and networking. Thus, propose solutions for diversity and inclusion.  
 Technical Sponsorship  : QoMEX is typically sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society implemented as a technical co-sponsorship. It requires an explicit application process and further details can be provided by the Steering Committee Chairs. QUALINET   is a technical sponsor by default and its name or/and logo shall be included in all communication of the conference (i.e., web site, call for papers, email, social media, conference program, etc.). The QUALINET sponsorship package can be obtained from the Chair of QUALINET: Prof. Touradj EBRAHIMI  .

 12th EAI International Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness   
 7 – 8 July 2016   
 Best Western Arirang Hill Hotel, Seoul, South Korea   
 Scope   
 Computer networking has been embracing increased heterogeneity since its inception, in terms of the range of the applications it has to support, the various communication technologies it can run on, and the hierarchical, hybrid and heterogeneous techniques it has to rely on to meet the challenges from both the diverse application requirements and communication technologies.  
 The only conference focusing on heterogeneous networking, QShine has been established as the primary venue for researchers and practitioners to disseminate exchange and discuss all recent advances related to heterogeneous networking, particularly for quality, experience, reliability, security and robustness.  
 Original submissions, not under any concurrent reviews, are solicited in all areas related to heterogeneous wired, wireless and hybrid networks varying from sensor, vehicle, cellular, ad hoc, enterprise, datacentre, to service-provider and overlay networks, ranging from in/on-body, personal/local/metropolitan/wide-area, to intra/inter-planetary scales.

 QoS measurement-based CAC for an IP Telephony system    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2009 
  Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Networks, 6th International ICST Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness, QShine 2009 and 3rd International Workshop on Advanced Architectures and Algorithms for Internet Delivery and Applications, AAA-IDEA 2009, Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain, November 23-25, 2009, Proceedings 
  pp.3-19 

 This work presents a Call Admission Control (CAC) system for a SIP-based IP Telephony platform. Configured for a multi-branch enterprise environment, the system enables international calls to be established in two steps: one step using Voice over IP (VoIP) through the Internet between the local office and a VoIP-PSTN gateway placed at destination country, and a second step by means of PSTN, from the gateway to the end-user, accounted with local tariffs. CAC decisions are based on Quality of Service (QoS) measurements, call tariffs and also on the number of available lines in the gateway. The CAC has been implemented within a test platform based on virtualization. Measurements to evaluate and validate CAC's impairment on call establishment delays have been obtained. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.   

 Towards Real-Time Stream Quality Prediction: Predicting Video Stream Quality from Partial Stream Information    
   
 Full-text available    
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2009 
  Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Networks, 6th International ICST Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness, QShine 2009 and 3rd International Workshop on Advanced Architectures and Algorithms for Internet Delivery and Applications, AAA-IDEA 2009, Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain, November 23-25, 2009, Proceedings 
  pp.20-33 

 While mechanisms exist to evaluate the user-perceived quality of video streamed over computer networks, there are few good mechanisms to do so in real time. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of predicting the stream quality of partial portions of a video stream based on either complete or incomplete information from previously rated streams. Using stream state information collected from an instrumented media player application and subjective stream quality ratings similar to the Mean Opinion Score, we determine whether a stream quality prediction algorithm utilizing dynamic time warping as a distance measure can rate partial streams with an accuracy on par with that achieved by the same predictor when rating full streams. We find that such a predictor can achieve comparable, and in some cases markedly better, accuracy over a wide range of possible partial stream portions, and that we can achieve this using portions of as little as ten seconds.   

 Risk-Aware QoP/QoS Optimization for Multimedia Applications in Wireless Networks    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2009 
  Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Networks, 6th International ICST Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness, QShine 2009 and 3rd International Workshop on Advanced Architectures and Algorithms for Internet Delivery and Applications, AAA-IDEA 2009, Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain, November 23-25, 2009, Proceedings 
  pp.34-51 

 The unique characteristics of wireless networks pose a number of nontrivial challenges to multimedia applications with security and rigorous QoS requirements. Lack of adequate security protection is incapable of meeting security requirements of applications, whereas enabling excessive security services inevitably leads to further degradation in QoS due to additional computation and payload encapsulation. Early work, e.g. LAP, achieves balance by adjusting security policy according to QoS metrics; but none of them are security guaranteed. In this paper, we present an efficient risk-aware QoP (Quality of Protection) and QoS optimization algorithm for multimedia applications in wireless networks. It can achieve an optimization for QoP/QoS performance metrics through offering hierarchical security services and QoS support. Experiment demonstrates that even in high risk environments our scheme can efficiently balance QoP and QoS requirements. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.   

 COCONET: Co-operative cache driven overlay network for P2P VoD streaming    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2009 
  Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Networks, 6th International ICST Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness, QShine 2009 and 3rd International Workshop on Advanced Architectures and Algorithms for Internet Delivery and Applications, AAA-IDEA 2009, Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain, November 23-25, 2009, Proceedings 
  pp.52-68 

 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approaches are gaining increasing popu- larity for video streaming applications due to their potential for Internet- level scalability. P2P VoD (Video On-Demand) applications pose more technical challenges than P2P live streaming since the peers are less synchronized over time as the playing position varies widely across the total video length along with the requirement to support VCR opera- tions such as random seek, Fast-Forward and Backward (FF/FB). We propose COCONET in this paper, which uses a distributed cache partly contributed by each participant thereby achieving a random content dis- tribution pattern independent of the playing position. It also achieves an O(1) search eciency for any random seek and FF/FB operation to any video segment across the total video stream with very low mainte- nance cost through any streaming overlay size. Performance evaluation by simulation indicates the eectiveness of COCONET to support our claim.   

 Opportunistic Multipath Routing in Wireless Mesh Networks    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2009 
  Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Networks, 6th International ICST Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness, QShine 2009 and 3rd International Workshop on Advanced Architectures and Algorithms for Internet Delivery and Applications, AAA-IDEA 2009, Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain, November 23-25, 2009, Proceedings 
  pp.71-85 

 This paper investigates combining opportunistic routing techniques with multipath routing for achieving reliability and timeliness in fast-changing network conditions. We present two approaches, WIMOP and DOMR, based on source routing and distributed routing, respectively. Instead of using broadcast packets as in most opportunistic routing work, we use unicast with promiscuous listening so that the reliability at each hop can be increased through retransmissions, while maintaining the broadcasting property required by opportunistic routing. We evaluate our work in NS2 against single path routing and MORE. Our results show that using the same amount of redundant data, our approaches were able to achieve better reliability than MORE. In addition, DOMR also has the advantage over WIMOP that it requires significantly less computational time.   

 Gateways Congestion-Aware Design of Multi-radio Wireless Networks    
   
 Conference Paper

 In Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), traffic is mainly routed by WMN Backbone (WMNB) between the mesh clients and the Internet and goes through mesh gateways. Since almost all traffic has to pass through one of the MGs, the network may be unexpectedly congested at one or more of them, even if every mesh router provides enough throughput capacity. In this paper, we address the problem of congestion of gateways while designing WMNs. We propose a simultaneous optimization of three competing objectives, namely network deployment cost, interference between network channels and congestion of gateways while guaranteeing full coverage for mesh clients. We tailor a nature inspired meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the model whereby, several trade-off solutions are provided to the network planner to choose from. A comparative experimental study with different key parameter settings is conducted to evaluate the performance of the model. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.   

 Novel Analytical Delay Model and Burst Assembly Scheme for Wireless Mesh and Optical Burst Switching Convergence    
   
 Conference Paper    

 Nov 2009 
  Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Networks, 6th International ICST Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness, QShine 2009 and 3rd International Workshop on Advanced Architectures and Algorithms for Internet Delivery and Applications, AAA-IDEA 2009, Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain, November 23-25, 2009, Proceedings 
  pp.104-119 

 Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) have attracted increasing attention from the research community as a high-performance and low-cost solution to last-mile broadband Internet access. In the other side, Optical Burst Switching (OBS) is a promising access technology that uses optical fiber with burst switching paradigm. In this paper, we propose a novel Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) architecture, called Optical Burst Wireless Mesh Architecture (OBWMA) which integrates WMN at the user access side and OBS at the core of the MAN. OBWMA aims to combine advantages of both WMNs and OBS networks, such as large coverage at low cost and bandwidth availability. We specify the details of the interconnection and the internetworking of WMNs and the OBS network in OBWMA. Moreover, we develop an analytical model to compute the end-to-end delay in OBWMA in order to support flow requests with delay constraints. Furthermore, we propose a Control Bridge (CB) that ensures Quality of Service (QoS) mapping at the border between the WMN and the OBS parts. Also, we propose a burst assembly scheme, called Adaptive Hybrid Burst Assembly scheme (AHBA). Simulation results using ns-2 demonstrate the feasibility of OBWMA and the validity of our analytical model. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 Due to bandwidth constraint and highly dynamic topology in ad hoc network systems, one of the major challenges is the deployment of end-to-end quality-of service support mechanisms. Time-sensitive communications like video applications may be seriously disrupted if these QoS support mechanisms don’t exist. In this paper we propose a QoS routing protocol based on AODV (AQA-AODV), which creates routes according to application QoS requirements. We have introduced link and path available bandwidth estimation mechanisms and an adaptive scheme that can provide feedback to the source node about the current network state, to allow the application to appropriately adjust the transmission rate. The simulation results reveal the performance improvements in terms of packet loss and delay while the end-to-end throughput is not affected compared with the throughput achieved by other protocols like AODV.

 Wireless sensor networks are emerging as a convenient mechanism to constantly monitor the physical world. The volume of information in such networks can be extremely large and, to be meaningful to applications, this information must be processed at the right level of accuracy. However, there is an inherent trade-off between achieving a high degree of data accuracy and the communication overhead associated with achieving it. We present a simple mechanism for spatially approximate query processing. We present a protocol that leverages gossip based routing to collect network data from a randomly selected set of nodes at a user-defined level of accu- racy. We extend this protocol to address persistent queries, long running queries where network data is collected periodically, by treating a persistent query as a temporal aggregate of individual queries. Finally, we provide a novel protocol that dynamically adapts its accuracy based on the quality of the responses to individual requests in the persistent query. We describe this protocol in detail and evaluate its performance through simulation.

 Abstract—To achieve,required,sensing,coverage,for a very long period,of time,is an important,and,challenging,problem in sensor network design. Recently, Tong et al. have proposed a node replacement and reclamation (NRR) strategy, and designed an adaptive rendezvous-based two-tier scheduling (ARTS) scheme. However, the ARTS scheme only considers point coverage but not area coverage, which is required in many applications. To address this limitation, we propose in this paper a new implementing scheme,for the NRR strategy based,on a novel staircase-based scheduling,model. Extensive simulations,have been conducted,to verify that the proposed,scheme,is effective and,efficient. Key Words: Sensor Networks, Reclamation and Replacement,

  pp.167-182 

 The use of mobile sensors is of great relevance to monitor critical areas where sensors cannot be deployed manually. The presence of data collector sinks causes increased energy depletion in their proximity, due to the higher relay load under multi-hop communication schemes (sink-hole phenomenon). We propose a new approach towards the solution of this problem by means of an autonomous deployment algorithm that guarantees the adaptation of the sensor density to the sink proximity and enables their selective activation. The proposed algorithm also permits a fault tolerant and self-healing deployment, and allows the realization of an integrated solution for deployment, dynamic relocation and selective sensor activation. Performance comparisons between our proposal and previous approaches show how the former can efficiently reach a deployment at the desired variable density with moderate energy consumption under a wide range of operative settings.

 The real-time control data delivery system of the Critical Infrastructure (i.e. SCADA - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system) is important because appropriate decisions cannot be made without having data delivered in a timely manner. Because these applications use multiple heterogeneous resources such as CPU, network bandwidth and storage, they call for an integrated and coordinated real-time scheduling across multiple resources to meet end-to-end deadlines. We present a design and implementation of iDSRT - an integrated dynamic soft real-time system to provide fine-grained end-to-end delay guarantees over WLAN. iDSRT takes the deadline partitioning approach: end-to-end deadlines are partitioned into multiple sub-deadlines for CPU scheduling and network scheduling. It integrates three important schedulers: task scheduler, packet scheduler and node scheduler to achieve global coordination. We validate iDSRT in Linux and evaluate it in an experimental SCADA test-bed. The results are promising and show that iDSRT can successfully achieve soft real-time guarantees in SCADA system with very low packet loss rate compared to available commodity best-effort systems.

 Introducing cell breathing in cellular networks into wireless local area networks (WLANs) for load balancing is beneficial since no special modification of clients. However, fairness and effectiveness is quite challenging in cell breathing. In this paper, a supply-demand model (SDM) based on cell breathing technique is proposed to allocate continuous or discrete power to APs for fair and effective load balancing. SDM classifies the beacon power of an AP into two kinds: the demand power and the supply power. The former is the ideal power that an AP is supposed to have while the latter is the power the AP actually transmits. Finding the deterministic global optimal solution, SDM makes the demand and supply power as equal as possible and the load on APs balanced. Because SDM does not need multiple iterations to compute the optimum, it can avoid frequent user handoffs resulting from frequent power change. Finally, SDM is extended to support a broader range of load definition and the generalized relationship between beacon power and load. The simulation results show the proposed scheme is fair for realizing load balancing and effective for improving throughput. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

  pp.218-231 

 This paper evaluates the performance of QoS-aware Mobile IP Fast Authentication Protocol (QoMIFA) compared to the well-known Simple QoS signaling protocol (Simple QoS) via simulation studies modeled in the ns2. The evaluation comprises the investigation of network load impact on both protocols with respect to the time required to reserve resources, number of dropped packets per handoff and number of packets sent as best-effort after the handoff is completed and until resources are reserved. Our simulation results show that QoMIFA is capable of achieving fast and smooth handoffs in addition to its capability of reserving resources very quickly. QoMIFA is approximately 97.75 % and 73.92 % faster than Simple QoS with respect to the average time required to reserve resources on downlink and uplink, respectively. It drops 79.63 % less on downlink and 46.6 % less on uplink and results in 98.40 % less packets sent on downlink as best-effort.

 Pervasive computing applications envision sensor rich computing and networking environments that can capture various types of contexts of inhabitants of the environment, such as their locations, activities, vital signs, and environmental measures. Such context information is useful in a variety of applications, for example to manage health information to promote independent living in “aging-in-place” scenarios. In reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts are often ambiguous, leading to potentially dangerous decisions if not properly handled. Thus, a significant challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for pervasive computing applications is the ability to deal with these ambiguous contexts. In this paper, we propose a resource optimized quality assured context mediation framework for resource constrained sensor networks based on efficient context-aware data fusion and information theoretic sensor parameter selection for optimal state estimation. The proposed framework provides a systematic approach based on dynamic Bayesian networks to derive context fragments and deal with context ambiguity or error in a probabilistic manner. Experimental results using SunSPOT sensors demonstrate the promise of this approach.

 The paper presents an analysis of short- and long-term changes in the QoS of intercontinental connections. First we will show that despite fast and numerous advances in physical layer, link layer, router capacity and new telecommunication cables deployment, QoS measures are hardly progressing in long-term (years) perspective. Transatlantic (North America – Europe) connections will be thoroughly analyzed. Next we will show that due to submarine cable breakages temporary network performance is unpredictable. It may be much poorer than average and sometimes drops below the acceptable level – case study is provided. Even if the links are fully operational, due to the rerouting the QoS may deteriorate in the case of cable fault in another part of the World. The research is based mainly on data taken from IEPM (Internet End-to-end Performance Measurement) database.

  pp.265-279 

 Several research and production networks now provide multiple Gbps dedicated connections to meet the demands of large data transfers over wide-area networks. End users, however, have not been able to see corresponding increase in application goodputs mainly because (i) such rates have pushed the bottleneck from the network to the end system, and (ii) the traditional transport methods are not optimized for handling host dynamics. Due to the sharing with unknown background workloads, the data receiver oftentimes lacks sufficient system resources to process packets arriving from high-speed dedicated links, therefore leading to significant packet drops at the end system. We propose a rigorous design approach for a new class of transport protocols that explicitly account for the dynamics of the running environment to maximize application goodputs over dedicated connections. The control strategy of the proposed transport method combines two aspects: (i) the receiving bottleneck rate is predicted based on performance modeling, and (ii) the sending rate is stabilized at the estimated bottleneck rate based on stochastic approximation. We test the proposed method on a local dedicated connection and the experimental results illustrate its superior performance over existing methods.   

 Probabilistic Network Loads with Dependencies and the Effect on Queue Sojourn Times

  pp.280-296 

 For the dimensioning of shared resources, the latency and utilization of the service is a vital design characteristic. The throughput and latency is as important for e.g. network streaming applications as in e.g. (small-scale) distributed embedded systems interacting with physical processes. Calculating latencies of a system involves the analysis of the queue sojourn times. The analysis of queue sojourn time depends on the model of the load. While for fixed and known load, natural and deterministic worst-case models are a good choice, highly variable loads are more appropriately modeled in a stochastic fashion. For the analysis of stochastic load models, the load is often assumed to be stochastic independent and time-invariant. Analysis of loads with auto-correlation or modelling of different streams that are correlated (or dependent in general) requires a highly tuned and specialized model to capture all effects. In this work we apply a queuing sojourn time analysis of streams with stochastic load models with upper and lower bounds guaranteed under any stochastic dependency. The experimental results show how big the effect of dependencies really is and that stochastic load dependency is vital to the calculation of resource utilization and response times (or transmission delays). We propose the use of Fréchet bounds and probability boxes to allow real-time analysis of stochastic models with unknown dependencies.   

 Providing Performance Guarantees for Buffered Crossbar Switches without Speedup    
   
 Conference Paper

  pp.297-314 

 Buffered crossbar switches are special crossbar switches with each crosspoint equipped with a small exclusive buffer. The crosspoint buffers decouple input ports and output ports, and simplify switch scheduling. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm called Fair and Localized Asynchronous Packet Scheduling (FLAPS) for buffered crossbar switches, to provide tight performance guarantees. FLAPS needs no speedup for the crossbar and handles variable length packets without segmentation and reassembly (SAR). With FLAPS, each input port and output port independently make scheduling decisions and rely on only local queue statuses. We theoretically show that a crosspoint buffer size of 4L is sufficient for FLAPS to avoid buffer overflow, where L is the maximum packet length. In addition, we prove that FLAPS achieves strong stability, and provides bounded delay guarantees. Finally, we present simulation data to verify the analytical results.

 Maximizing the aggregate network utility and minimizing the network energy consumption are important but conflict goals in wireless sensor networks. Challenges arise due to the application-specific computing and communication resources constraints and end-to-end real-time constraints. This paper studies the tradeoff between energy consumption and network performance in Real-Time Wireless Sensor Networks (RTWSN) by investigating the interaction between the network performance optimization and network lifetime maximization problems. We address the tradeoff between these two conflict goals as a joint non-linear optimization problem. Based the solution of the optimization problem, we design an online distributed algorithm to achieve judicious tradeoff based on application-specific focus, while at the same time meeting real-time and resource constraints. Extensive simulation studies illustrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

  pp.334-350 

 A number of network-level techniques have been proposed to mitigate inter-cell interference and improve throughput for cell-edge users in wide-area wireless data networks. To facilitate the coordination among base stations (BSs), we propose a new radio-resource management framework where cell-edge users and cell-interior users are separately managed by two different radio-resource managers (RRM). In the proposed framework, we address the issue of how to classify a user as cell-edge user or cell-interior user, and how much radio resource the cell-edge users may occupy. We present a solution where a user switches the RRM so as to maximize overall network throughput subject to the condition that her own throughput does not decrease upon switching. We verify our solution using analysis and simulation experiments, and demonstrate that our solution can guarantee superior cell-edge performance and achieve high network throughput.

 The behavior of selfish users, which does not respect the backoff procedure of IEEE 802.11 WLAN, has been nicely studied in game-theoretic frameworks. However, in these studies, the effect of physical carrier sense has not been properly incorporated into the analysis. In this paper, we study the problem of how carrier sense misbehavior can affect network performance in addition to backoff misbehavior. Our analysis shows that a cheater can increase its throughput by ignoring the carrier sense mechanism while a well-behaved user significantly loses its throughput. Consequently, not only a malicious user, but also a selfish one is motivated to disregard the carrier sense mechanism, which will result in significant throughput degradation of well-behaved ones. Our analysis also shows that carrier sense misbehavior corresponds to the case of virtually increasing the channel access probability of the cheater in the backoff procedure. We provide our preliminary simulation results, which verify our analysis.

  pp.363-379 

 In this paper, we propose a bidirectional bandwidth-allocation mechanism to improve TCP performance in the IEEE 802.16 WiMAX networks. According to the IEEE 802.16 standard, when serving a downlink TCP flow, the transmission of the uplink ACK, which is performed over a separate unidirectional connection, incurs additional bandwidth-request/allocation delay. Thus, it increases the round trip time of the downlink TCP flow and results in the decrease of throughput accordingly. First, we derive an analytical model to investigate the effect of the uplink bandwidth-request/allocation delay on the downlink TCP throughput. Second, we propose a simple, yet effective, bidirectional bandwidth-allocation mechanism that couples the bandwidth allocation for uplink and downlink connections by using either proactive bandwidth allocation or piggyback bandwidth request. The proposed scheme reduces unnecessary bandwidth-request delay and the relevant signaling overhead due to proactive allocation; meanwhile, it maintains high efficiency of uplink bandwidth usage by using piggyback request. Moreover, our proposed scheme is quite simple and practical; it can be simply implemented in the base station without requiring any modification in the subscriber stations or resorting to any cross-layer signaling mechanisms. The simulation results ascertain that the proposed approach significantly increases the downlink TCP throughput and the uplink bandwidth efficiency.

 Streaming a live music concert over the Internet is a challenging task as it requires real-time, high-quality data delivery over a large number of geographically distributed nodes. In this paper we propose MusiCast, a real-time peer-to-peer multicast system for streaming midi events and compressed audio data. We present a scalable and distributed tree construction algorithm where nodes across the Internet self-organize into a low-latency tree. Our system is built ontop of the pastry DHT and takes advantage of the DHT’s properties to construct an end-to-end low-latency dissemination tree using topology oriented information. The benefit of our scheme is that it is completely decentralized, allowing nodes to connect to each other using local information only, and achieves good performance by considering latency information when constructing the tree. Our experimental results illustrate the benefits of our approach.

 The exponential growth of digital data in contemporary computer networks induces a lot of scalability, resilience, and survivability issues. At the same time, the increasing complexity of digital data makes the task of similarity searching that is inherently difficult, more and more important. In this paper, we report on the Multi Feature Indexing Network, MUFIN, which is an extensible, scalable, and infrastructure independent similarity search engine. It is able to achieve high performance and guarantee quality of service by applying structured Peer-to-Peer networks. On the other hand, its unstructured version based on self-organizing principles is extremely robust and able to operate in very volatile environments.

 Network intrusion detection is a key security issue that can be tackled by means of different approaches. This paper describes a novel methodology for network attack detection based on the use of data mining techniques to process traffic information collected by a monitoring station from a set of hosts using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The proposed approach, adopting unsupervised clustering techniques, allows to effectively distinguish normal traffic behavior from malicious network activity and to determine with very good accuracy what kind of attack is being perpetrated. Several monitoring stations are then interconnected according to any peer-to-peer network in order to share the knowledge base acquired with the proposed methodology, thus increasing the detection capabilities. An experimental test-bed has been implemented, which reproduces the case of a real web server under several attack techniques. Results of the experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, with no detection failures of true attacks and very low false-positive rates (i.e. false alarms). © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 In this paper we consider a provider that offers a SOA application implemented as a composite service to several users with different Qos requirements. For such a system, we present a scalable framework to the QoS-aware self-adaptation based on a two layer reference architecture. The first layer addresses the adaptation at the provisioning level: operating at a slower time scale, its role is to identify the set of candidate services to implement the system functionality at the required user QoS. The second layer addresses the adaptation at the service selection level: operating on a faster time scale, its role is to determine at running time the actual services which are bound to each user request while meeting both provider and user QoS. We formulate the adaptation strategy of both layers as suitable optimization problems which can be efficiently solved using standard techniques. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 Understanding and optimizing the energy consumption of wireless devices is critical to maximize network lifetime and to provide guidelines for the design of new protocols and interfaces.

We also analyze the impact of the energy configuration of the device on the throughput performance, and discuss in which circumstances throughput and energy efficiency can be both maximized and where they constitute different challenges.

 Transmit power control has been largely proposed as a solution to improve the performance of packet radio systems in terms of increased throughput, spatial reuse and battery lifetime for mobile terminals. However, the benefits of transmit power control schemes on these different performance figures may strongly depend on the employed PHY technology and channel access mechanism. In this paper, we focus on the effects of power control on the energy consumption of WiFi network cards. By means of several experimental tests carried out under different operation conditions and modulation schemes, we try to justify why the reduction of the transmission power has a marginal effect on the overall energy consumption. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 Sensor grid deployments integrate wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Grid Computing (GC) into a merged platform. A middleware architecture is a prerequisite for sensor grids in order to bridge the two heterogeneous technologies and efficiently support aggregated grid services available to a large number of grid users. On the other hand, the energy conservation of the participating sensor nodes is an essential factor for QoS provisioning, thereby extending WSNs survivability and providing diversity to potential grid services. For the best of our knowledge, power awareness for middleware architectures for sensor grids has never been studied in the literature so far. The rationale of our work employs a scheduler which provides QoS to the grid users from an energy awareness perspective by interacting with an appropriate resource manager. Our simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme whereas a proxy-based middleware for sensor grids has been adapted.

 Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) over Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is becoming popular thanks to its cost efficiency. However, it has been a challenge to provide good quality of VoIP services in WLANs, which is due mainly to (i) the nature of contention-based channel access of WLAN Medium Access Control (MAC); (ii) the presence of coexisting non-real-time data traffic; and (iii) the time-varying WLAN capacity caused by transmission rate diversity and variation of stations over time. In this paper, we propose a simple, effective and viable solution to improve the quality of VoIP services in 802.11e contention-based WLANs, which basically utilizes the advanced features of 802.11e MAC for QoS support. The key ingredients of our solution include (i) a priority queue to serve the VoIP traffic with higher priority than the non-real-time data traffic; and (ii) a conservative history-based admission control scheme for VoIP services, which accommodates the transmission rate diversity and variation of ongoing VoIP sessions over time. Simulation results demonstrate that our solution admits as many VoIP calls as possible without compromising the quality of their services.

 The visibility and success ofWireless Mesh Network (WMN) deployments has raised interest among commercial operators in this technology. Compared to traditional operator access networks WMNs have the potential to offer easier deployment and flexible self-reconfiguration at lower costs. A WMN-type architecture considered as an alternative for an operator access network must meet similar requirements such as high availability and guaranteed QoS in order to support triple-play content provisioning. In this paper we introduce an architecture of such a Carrier-grade Wireless Mesh Access Network (CG-WMAN). We then present our contribution, an approach to seamlessly integrate unidirectional broadcast cells (i.e. DVB-T) into such a CG-WMAN. This allows higher layer protocols to utilize broadcast ce lls like regular mesh links, where beneficial for a given payload and receiver distribution. We then present a typical use case and discuss for which combinations of traffic type, user distribution and QoS requirements the use of longer range broadcast technologies can help to improve the overall CG-WMAN performance in terms of throughput and reliability.

 PlanetLab is a global scale platform for experimentation of new networking applications in a real environment. It consists of several nodes, offered by academic institutions or companies spread all over the world, that can be shared by the networking community for its tests. The main drawback of PlanetLab is its scarce heterogeneity in terms of the access technologies it offers. In this paper we discuss the efforts we made in order to alleviate this problem. We first developed a tool that allowed us to integrate a WiFi testbed controllable by OMF (Orbit Management Framework) [16] in PlanetLab by means of a multi-homed PlanetLab node. OMF is a set of tools that make it easy to automatically execute experiments and collect measurements on a WiFi testbed. The tool we developed allows, more generally, to solve the issues that arises with multi-homed PlanetLab nodes (i.e. PlanetLab nodes having more than a network interface). In order to be able to fully exploit the potential of such PlanetLab nodes, there is the need for the users to add routing rules (e.g. rules to reach a destination through the WiFi interface, instead of the Ethernet interface). Such operation cannot be performed in a PlanetLab environment, as the rules a user adds would also affect other users' traffic. Therefore it arises the necessity of user-specific routing tables, i.e. routing tables whose rules are only valid for traffic belonging to that user. In this way the user is able to route his traffic through the WiFi interface, and make it traverse the OMF-controllable WiFi testbed, while other users' traffic continues to get routed through the default primary interface. We also had to support the integration of the OMF facilities (e.g. the OMF controller) into the user environment, which is called slice, in order to allow for the customization of the testbed (e.g. loading a specific disk image on each node) and the automatical execution of experiments. The software we developed to achieve such integration is in the process of being integrated in the code base of PlanetLab, so that anyone is able to integrate its wireless infrastructure in PlanetLab. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 Mesh and relay networks promise to increase the reach, capacity, and throughput of wireless communication networks. As a prominent example, the reservation-based IEEE 802.16 standard (as the basis for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX) comes with basic protocol mechanisms for an optional mesh mode as well as a relay mode of operation. This paper proposes a proportionally fair scheduler to fully utilize the potential of wireless mesh by exploiting spatial reuse. The scheduler is discussed within the setting of an IEEE 802.16 network operating with centralized scheduling in the mesh mode. We investigate the entire process of (1) bandwidth reservation, (2) calculation of the schedule and the bandwidth allocation, and (3) dissemination and activation of the schedule using an extension to the standard to allow for slot reuse. A performance analysis shows the feasibility of the proposed scheduling scheme and allows for insights into prospective future research areas in IEEE 802.16 networks.

 Exploiting features of high density wireless sensor networks represents a challenging issue. In this work, the training of a sensor net-work which consists of anonymous and asynchronous sensors, randomly and massively distributed in a circular area around a more powerful de-vice, called actor, is considered. The aim is to partition the network area in concentric coronas and sectors, centered at the actor, and to bring each sensor autonomously to learn to which corona and sector belongs. The new protocol, called Cooperative, is the fastest training algorithm for asynchronous sensors, and it matches the running time of the fastest known training algorithm for synchronous sensors. More-over, to be trained, each sensor stays awake only a constant number of time slots, independent of the network size, consuming very limited en-ergy. The performances of the new protocol, measured as the number of trained sensors, the accuracy of the achieved localization, and the consumed energy, are also experimentally tested under different network density scenarios.

 Agent-based data collection and aggregation have been proved to be efficient in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).While most of existing work focus on designing various single agent based itinerary planning (SIP) algorithms by considering energy-efficiency and/or aggregation efficiency, this paper identifies the drawbacks of this approach in large scale network, and proposes a solution through multi-agent based itinerary planning (MIP). A novel framework is presented to divide ourMIP algorithm into four parts: visiting central location (VCL) selection algorithm, source-grouping algorithm, SIP algorithm and its iterative algorithm. Our simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed scheme lowers delay and improves the integrated energy-delay performance compared to the existing solutions with the similar computation complexity. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 The deployment of sensor networks is both widespread and varied with more niche applications based on these networks. In the case study provided in this work, the network is provided by two football teams with sensors generating continuous heart rate values for the duration of the activity. In wireless networks such as these, the requirement is for complex methods of data management in order to deliver more and more powerful query results. In effect, what is required is a traditional database-style query interface where domain experts can continue to probe for the answers required in more specialised environments. This paper describes a system and series of experiments that requires powerful data management capabilities to meet the requirements of sports scientists.

 A novel approach for achieving high Quality of Service (QoS) in sensor networks via topology control is introduced and experimentally assessed in this paper. Our approach falls in the broader discipline of graph structural mining, and exploits a leading concept initially studied in the context of Social Network Analysis (SNA), namely betweenness. Particularly, in our research betweenness is applied in terms of a graph structural mining measure embedded in the core layer of our proposed topology control algorithm, called Edge Betweenness Centrality (EBC). EBC allows us to evaluate relationships between entities of the network (e.g., nodes, edges), and hence identify different roles among them (e.g., brokers, outliers). In turn, deriving knowledge is further exploited to define raking operators that look at structural properties of the graph modeling the target sensor network. Based on these amenities, our topology control algorithm is able of providing an “insight” of the graph structure of the network on top which control over information flow, message delivery, latency and energy dissipation among nodes can be easily deployed.

 In data-centric sensor networks each device is like a minimal computer with cpu and memory able to sense, manage and transmit data performing in-network processing by means of insertions, querying and multi-hop routings. Saving energy is one of the most important goals, therefore radio transmissions, which are the most expensive operations, should be limited by optimizing the number of routings. Moreover the network traffic should be balanced among nodes in order to avoid premature discharge of some devices and then network partitions. In this paper we present a fully decentralized infrastructure able to self-organize fully functional data centric sensor networks from local interactions and learning among devices. Differently from existing solutions, our proposal does not require complex devices that need global information or external help from systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), which works only outdoor with a precision and an efficacy both limited by weather conditions and obstacles. Our solution can be applied to a wider number of scenarios, including mesh networks and wireless community networks. The local learning occurs by exploiting implicit cost-free overhearing at sensors. The work reports an extensive number of comparative experiments, using several distributions of sensors and data, with a well-know competitor solution in literature, showing that an approach fully based on self-organization is more efficient than traditional solutions depending on GPS. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 Multimedia data are sensitive to delay which deteriorates the video quality and the perception of the viewer. Due to the sensitivity to the delay, transmitting multimedia data over inherently variant wireless channels is a big challenge. Although wireless systems have employed adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) to combat the variation of the environment, the possible delay in the buffers still has impacts on the video quality. In this paper, the focus is on the performance of wireless multimedia streaming using AMC. In particular, the video frame error rate and the resulting GOP distortion for video streaming is analyzed. It is observed that the video quality depends on the target packet error rate of the AMC, which also determines the SNR thresholds of AMC. Through our analysis, the optimal target PER of AMC and the resulting SNR thresholds can be obtained to achieve the optimal video quality that minimizes the GOP distortion. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 In this paper, a radio resource sharing scheme for wireless cellular network is investigated to achieve efficiency and fairness among base stations. We propose a credit-token based spectrum sharing algorithm. Game theory is utilized to formulate and analyze the proposed spectrum sharing algorithm. We first discuss the simplest two-base-station game through a graphical method to gain insights for the solution. Afterwards, the Nash Equilibrium of the n-base-station game is derived and the spectrum allocation at the Nash equilibrium is shown to be unique. Several desirable properties, including allocative efficiency, Pareto optimality, weighted max-min fairness, and weighted proportional fairness, are proved to be attained at the Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we design a strategy-proof spectrum allocation mechanism based on the proposed spectrum sharing algorithm so that truthful declarations of spectrum demands maximize the performance in each cell.

 traditional audio conferencing now may involve heterogeneous teleconferencing devices, including POTS phone, VoIP phones, dual-mode smart phones, and so on. During a multi-party audio conference involving heterogeneous devices, it is possible that a video conference is held concurrently involving a subset of devices capable of processing video streams for better the conferencing experience. In such a scenario, the need for synchronization between circuit-switched audio streams and packet-switched video streams arises. While the problem of audio-video synchronization has been extensively investigated in related work, existing solutions are limited to synchronization in packet-data networks and hence are not applicable in the target environment. In this work, we consider the problem of supporting such an overlay video conference among dual-mode phones. We first transform the audio-video synchronization problem into the problem of synchronizing circuit-switched and packet-switched audio streams. We then propose an end-to-end solution for audio synchronization that is transparent to the heterogeneous network protocol suites involved. We investigate synchronization algorithms based on digital speech processing using different acoustic features of the speech signal in the waveform, cepstrum, and spectrum domains. We evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms under various impairments including codec distortion, line noises, packet losses, and overlapping utterances. Evaluation results show a promising direction for using DSP-based algorithms to address the synchronization problem across heterogeneous telephony systems. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 With its abundant bandwidth and worldwide availability, the 60 GHz band has been considered as a promising solution to provide multi-Gbps wireless transmission. Different standard bodies and industrial interest groups start various projects to develop technologies in the 60 GHz band for applications such as high-definition (HD) and fast file transfer. However, until now very little efforts are made to ensure interference-free coexistence between these technologies. In this paper, we investigate the interference problem in the 60 GHz band. The ECMA-387 standard is used as a study case to illustrate how some simple techniques can mitigate the interference among heterogenous devices in the 60 GHz band. We conduct both mathematical analysis and simulations to demonstrate the performance of these simple techniques and identify some problems for future improvements.

 Over 500 million host computers, three billion PCs and mobile devices consume over a billion kilowatts of electricity. As part of this "system" computer networks consume an increasing amount of energy, and help reduce energy expenditure from other sources through E-Work, E-Commerce and E-Learning. Traditionally, network design seeks to minimise network cost and maximise quality of service (QoS). This paper examines some approaches for dynamically managing wired packet networks to minimise energy consumption while meeting users' QoS needs, by automatically turning link drivers and/or routers on/off in response to changes in network load. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 Wireless roaming means that a mobile device is able to switch from one network cell to another while keeping the link to active services. Recent researches [13] showed that it increases the security to establish an authenticated and confidential tunnel directly to a home network which then acts as service provider respectively proxy server for further external services. In this paper we extend the trust assumptions and formal security goals for wireless roaming via tunnels (WRT) that were given by Manulis et al.[7]. Additonally, we propose an efficient protocol that realizes the authentication and key agreement for establishing the secure tunnel, whereby considering the delay restrictions that are given by current multimedia services like VoIP or video streaming. Furthermore we discuss the accounting problem and present a solution that ensures a fair accounting for the foreign network.

 The transition to multicore architectures has raised the urge to identify novel programming paradigms aimed at simplifying the development of parallel programs. Transactional Memories (TM) are regarded as one of the most promising approaches to address this issue, as highlighted by the huge interest garnered in the research community over the last years. Distributed Transactional Memories (DTMs) represent a very recent branching of the research line on TMs, aimed at enhancing their scalability and dependability. In this paper, we review some of our recent results and research directions focused on the integration of DTMs in clusters of web application servers and on the design of scalable and fault-tolerant DTM algorithms.

 Workflow-structured Web service composition is an emerging computing paradigm for constructing next-generation large-scale distributed applications within and across organizational boundaries. Mapping such application workflows in heterogeneous environments and optimizing their performance in terms of quick response and high scalability are vital to the success of these distributed applications. Workflows with complex execution semantics and dependencies are typically modeled as directed acyclic graphs. We construct cost models to estimate data processing and transfer overheads and formulate the restricted workflow mapping for minimum total execution time as an NP-complete optimization problem. We propose a heuristic approach to this problem that recursively computes and maps the critical path to network nodes using a dynamic programming-based procedure. The performance superiority of the proposed approach is illustrated by an extensive set of simulations and further verified by experimental results from a real network in comparison with existing methods. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 Service Oriented Architectures allow service brokers to execute business processes composed of network-accessible loosely-coupled services offered by a multitude of service providers, at different Quality of Service (QoS) and cost levels. To optimize their revenue and the offered QoS level, service brokers need to solve the problem of finding the set of service providers that minimizes the total execution time of the business process subject to cost and execution time constraints. This optimization problem is clearly NP-hard. Optimized algorithms that find the optimal solution without having to explore the entire solution space have been proposed to solve problems of moderate size. A heuristic search of the sub-optimal solution scales to problems of large size and is appropriate for runtime service selection. This paper evaluates the performance of three heuristic service selection algorithms that are candidates for implementation in scalable service brokers. Our goal is to identify which algorithm provides the solution closest to the optimal and how many selections are evaluated to find the solution. The comparison is made over a wide range of parameters including the complexity of the business process topology and the the tightness of the QoS and cost constraints. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 When deployed as operational components of production systems, novel computer services are supposed to respond synchronously to real-world events associated to the business process they implement, thereby needing to meet temporal constraints dictated by the dynamics of the environment in which they operate. This elicits a real-time system approach. One emerging concept to cope with such unpredictability of large-scale distributed computer applications is the use of feedback control principles. This paper introduces a feedback-based adaptive resource control algorithm for composite applications implementing real-time business process. The study is based on recent achievements in the field and ongoing progresses. A brief background on the field, the rationales of the proposed techniques and development results are presented. © Institute for Computer Science, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

 We focus on Erol Gelenbe's scientific and technical contributions to probability models in the computer and information sciences, but limit our survey to the last fifteen years. We start with a brief overview of his work as a single author, as well as his work in collaboration with over 200 co-authors. We discuss some of his recent and innovative work regarding a new probability model that represents Intermittent Energy Sources for Computing and Communications, introducing Energy Packet Networks which are a probabilistic representation of the flow, storage and consumption of electrical energy at the microscopic level (in electronic chips), and at the macroscopic level (e.g. in buildings or data centers) and for its routing and dynamic usage by consuming units (such as computer elements, chips or machines). We next discuss his work on designing computer and communication systems that parsimoniously use energy in order to achieve a satisfactory level of quality of service (QoS). Trade-offs between system QoS and energy consumption are also considered. Then we turn to Prof. Gelenbe's pioneering work on Autonomic Communications and the design and implementation of CPN, the Cognitive Packet Network, and we also briefly review his spiking random neural network that was used in CPN. This is followed by a brief review of work that he conducted since 1999 on human evacuation from dangerous or catastrophic environments, and the design of technology driven Emergency Management Systems. His research since the late 2000s on Gene Regulatory Networks is then covered together with its application to the detecting possible disease from microarray data. Finally, we briefly discuss some novel analytical models that he developed in this period with publications appearing in journals of physics and applied mathematics.

  The present work presents an architecture developed to evaluate the QoS parameters for the IPTV heterogeneous network. At its very basic level lie two software technologies: Video LAN and Windows Media Services with two operating systems: Windows and Linux. Three types of streams are analyzed, which will be transmitted to a Linux VLC client through means of the aggregation and access servers. The ... [Show full abstract]  first stream is generated in real time by a capture camera, processed by the encapsulated VC-1 encoder and sent to the Media Server, while the second one is of VoD(Video on Demand) type and the third one will be handled by DVBViewer through the MPEG TS form. The first stream is transcoded in H.264-AAC such that the Linux stations will recognize its format. Through the simultaneous transmission of the three streams, we are analyzing their performance from a QoS parameters point of view by means of an application implemented in C programming language. The stream transporting the DVB-S television content was proven to ensure the best performance regarding loss of packets, delays and jitter.

 Salable Video Coding Transmission over Heterogeneous Networks

  Video streaming is currently occupying a huge chunk of the Internet bandwidth. This is mainly attributed to the wide variety of applications that are being transmitted over current Internet infrastructure, such as videoconferencing, mobile television (TV), Internet video streaming, and Internet Protocol TV (IPTV). These applications are generally encoded using the H.264/AVC codec which encodes ... [Show full abstract]  the video content into a single layer stream with a fixed spatio-temporal video resolution. This poses a limitation for such applications since the same video content must be encoded into different streams in order to cater for heterogeneous devices demanding dif-ferent spatio-temporal resolutions. This paper presents the performance evaluation of the recent H.264/SVC standard. The H.264/SVC encodes the video into different layers and the receiving device can decide to drop some layers in order to meet the required spatio-temporal resolution. This work shows that transmission of H.264/SVC using multicasting provides a substantial reduction in bandwidth requirement over tradi-tional H.264/AVC. Simulation results further demonstrate that the H.264/SVC provides less congestion and is thus provides better Quality of Experience (QoE).

  With the deployment of heterogeneous networks, mobile users are expecting ubiquitous connectivity when using applications. For bandwidth-intensive applications such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), multimedia contents are typically transmitted using a multicast delivery method due to its bandwidth efficiency. However, not all networks support multicasting. Multicasting alone could lead to ... [Show full abstract]  service disruption when the users move from a multicast-capable network to a non-multicast network. In this paper, we propose a handover scheme called application layer seamless switching (ALSS) to provide smooth real-time multimedia delivery across unicast and multicast networks. ALSS adopts a soft handover to achieve seamless playback during the handover period. A real-time streaming testbed is implemented to investigate the overall handover performance, especially the overlapping period where both network interfaces are receiving audio and video packets. Both the quality of service (QoS) and objective-mapped quality of experience (QoE) metrics are measured. Experimental results show that the overlapping period takes a minimum of 56 and 4 ms for multicast-to-unicast (M2U) and unicast-to-multicast (U2M) handover, respectively. The measured peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) confirms that the frame-by-frame quality of the streamed video during the handover is at least 33 dB, which is categorized as good based on ITU-T recommendations. The estimated mean opinion score (MOS) in terms of video playback smoothness is also at a satisfactory level.

  Internet Protocol Television is defined as a multimedia service delivered over IP-based networks supporting quality of service (QoS), quality of experience (QoE), security, interactivity, and reliability. This service is rapidly expanding to both wireless and mobile networks through mobile devices. This trend demands a seamless IPTV service architecture for those mobile devices in heterogeneous ... [Show full abstract]  access networks. This is because the convergence of the heterogeneous access networks can resolve their own service-coverage limitations, eliminating dead spots. We first briefly research on the background and trend for the seamless IPTV service for heterogeneous networks. Next we propose a new system architecture taking the relevant technical issues into account. This architecture is mainly composed of three parts, (i) Information of network conditions on client, (ii) Signaling for communicating between client and server with information of network conditions, and (iii) Adaptive streaming based on information of network conditions. The proposed architecture can be deployed on any Internet protocol layers such as application layer, transport layer and network layer. In this paper, we evaluate two cases such as (i) RTSP in application layer and (ii) SCTP in transport layer and compare them through the performance evaluation. The results in the evaluation show that the proposed architecture meets well the requirements of the minimum IPTV service performance recommended by ITU-T international standard for the QoE over heterogeneous access networks.

 Towards Development of QoS Based Data and Service Oriented Mashup Platform

  Mashup is a new application development approach that allows users to aggregate multiple services to create a service for a new purpose. Data and service mashup technology is getting more attention in both enterprise and academia for building new end users applications fast in the complex and heterogeneous network environment in relatively short periods of time with little or no additional costs ... [Show full abstract]  to cover IT resources. Even if the Mashup approach opens new and broader opportunities for data/service consumers, the development process still requires the users to know not only how to write code using programming languages, but also how to select and use the different Web APIs from different services. Our architecture supports dynamic discovery of various APIs and performs interactive and sequential result refinement to improve the quality of the presented result. We proposed a script-based definition of mashups which facilitates the development as well as the dynamic execution of mashups. This architecture is realized using the QoS based Data and Service Mashup System (QDSMS), a novel platform to support end users to create, reuse and manage mashups based on mashup script based definition. We describe the overall design of QDSMS and discuss its main enabling technologies. This platform will improve the efficiency of mashup development and optimal use of storage and computing power of the network and server elements.

Packet loss due to limited band width and congestion can negatively impact on Quality of Experience(QoE). Packet trimming based innovative scheme is proposed in this article to deal packet loss and improve QoE. Proposed scheme eliminate the chance of packet loss during congestion. Packet trimming scheme better handle congestion which improve video smoothness, interactivity and frame quality.

  Quality of experience (QoE) has been a user-centric performance metric for multimedia communications. Existing communication protocols over heterogeneous networks are mostly based on quality of service, which ignores the user satisfaction and subjective evaluation. In this paper, the authors propose a novel QoE-aware multimedia communication framework for heterogeneous wireless networks. ... [Show full abstract]  Specifically, the authors make three main contributions in this paper: (i) a general QoE model has been established by jointly characterising the multimedia applications and heterogeneous networks, (ii) the issue of multimedia communications over heterogeneous networks has been transformed as a stochastic optimisation problem, and (iii) the optimal solution is provided by designing a QoE-aware multimedia scheduling scheme. Importantly, the proposed scheme is simply enough for online implementation. Numerical simulations have demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme.

 Abstract  
   
 Due to bandwidth constraint and highly dynamic topology in ad hoc network systems, one of the major challenges is the deployment of end-to-end quality-of service support mechanisms. Time-sensitive communications like video applications may be seriously disrupted if these QoS support mechanisms don’t exist. In this paper we propose a QoS routing protocol based on AODV (AQA-AODV), which creates routes according to application QoS requirements. We have introduced link and path available bandwidth estimation mechanisms and an adaptive scheme that can provide feedback to the source node about the current network state, to allow the application to appropriately adjust the transmission rate. The simulation results reveal the performance improvements in terms of packet loss and delay while the end-to-end throughput is not affected compared with the throughput achieved by other protocols like AODV.

 Large variations in network Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of bandwidth, latency, jitter may occur during media transfer over Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). Researchers have identified that complex computing applications experience “bursty” QoS behavior during their execution. Applications have to adapt their functions to any change in network status. Moreover, on enhanced software platform is necessary to provide adaptive network management services to upper software components. I-LABS, middleware architecture for service adaptation, are based on ad hoc network and service awareness. I-LABS is structured in such a way as to provide both QoS awareness to streaming applications and manage dynamic ad hoc network resources in an adaptive scheduler fashion. The overall architecture of I-LABS framework includes core components to connection establishment, connection monitor, policy manager and connection controller. Adaptive scheduler mechanisms are introduced as object based components such that I-LABS has been implemented using ns2 simulator toolkit to demonstrate the performance of mobile setup as a conference application.

 This paper presents a performance evaluation of the scalable video streaming over mobile ad hoc networks. In particular, we focus on the rate-adaptive method for streaming scalable video (H.264/SVC). For effective adaptation a new cross-layer routing protocol is introduced. This protocol provides an efficient algorithm for available bandwidth estimation. With this information, the video source adjusts its bit rate during the video transmission according to the network state. We also propose a free simulation framework that supports evaluation studies for scalable video streaming. The simulation experiments performed in this study involve the transmission of SVC streams with Medium Grain Scalability (MGS) as well as temporal scalability over different network scenarios. The results reveal that the rate-adaptive strategy helps avoid or reduce the congestion in MANETs obtaining a better quality in the received videos. Additionally, an actual ad hoc network was implemented using embedded devices (Raspberry Pi) in order to assess the performance of the proposed adaptive transmission mechanism in a real environment. Additional experiments were carried out prior to the implementation with the aim of characterizing the wireless medium and packet loss profile. Finally, the proposed approach shows an important reduction in energy consumption, as the study revealed.

 The development of video streaming services on wireless ad hoc networks is a challenge task as a consequence of different limitations such as bandwidth-constrained, variable capacity links and energy-constrained operation. Moreover, the dynamic topology of nodes causes frequent link failures and high error rates. We propose in this paper a performance evaluation of the scalable video streaming over mobile ad hoc networks. In particular, we focus on the rate-adaptive strategy for streaming scalable video (H.264/SVC). In order to provide QoS mechanisms in the routing process, a new routing protocol is introduced. This protocol estimates the available bandwidth value, which is sent to video source in order to adapt the bit rate during the video transmission. We also propose a simulation framework that supports evaluation studies for scalable video streaming. In the simulation experiments, SVC streams with combined scalability (quality and temporal scalability) were used. As quality scalability method, we used Medium Grain Scalability (MGS). The results reveal that the rate-adaptive method helps avoid or reduce the congestion in MANETs obtaining a better quality in the received videos.

 In most practical applications, ad hoc mobile devices demand the access to wired hosts located beyond the limits of the mobile ad hoc network, forming a heterogeneous wired-cum-wireless network. This interconnection requires a network device known as gateway. The gateway functions as a bridge between the ad hoc environment and infrastructure-based networks, as Internet. We propose in this paper an algorithm for the discovery and selection of gateways and its integration in a routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. Our proposed algorithm is based on an adaptive hybrid strategy where the proactive and reactive methods are combined. Consequently, gateways maintain routing information sending advertisement messages to mobile nodes inside a limited range (proactive area). Those nodes located outside that area must execute a reactive gateway discovery process. The size of the proactive area and the frequency of the control messages are dynamically adapted. The simulation results show that our approach achieves better results in terms of packet loss and delay without increasing the routing overhead.

 Debido a las limitaciones de ancho de banda y a la topología dinámica de las redes móviles ad hoc, uno de los mayores desafíos es el desarrollo de mecanismos de calidad de servicio que permitan que comunicaciones sensibles al retardo (por ejemplo videostreaming), no se vean seriamente afectadas. En esta tesina se propone un protocolo de encaminamiento basado en AODV (AQA-AODV), el cual establece rutas de acuerdo a los requerimientos de la capa de aplicación y el estado de la red. El protocolo propuesto incorpora un esquema de realimentación que permite estimar el máximo ancho de banda que puede soportar una ruta de n saltos e informar al nodo fuente para que éste ajuste apropiadamente su tasa de transmisión. Este es un atributo deseable sobre todo en aplicaciones donde es posible adaptar algunos parámetros en la codificación de fuente para reducir la tasa de envío. Los resultados de las simulaciones muestran mejoras importantes en términos de pérdidas de paquetes y el retardo, mientras que el throughput no se ve afectado en comparación con el throughput alcanzado con otros protocolos como AODV.

 One of the major challenges for the transmission of time-sensitive data like video over mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) is the deployment of an end-to-end QoS support mechanism. Therefore, several approaches and enhancements have been proposed concerning the routing protocols. In this paper we propose a new QoS routing protocol based on AODV (named AQA-AODV), which creates routes according to application QoS requirements. We have introduced link and path available bandwidth estimation mechanisms and an adaptive scheme that can provide feedback to the source node about the current network state, to allow the application to appropriately adjust the transmission rate. In the same way, we propose a route recovery approach into the AQA-AODV protocol, which provides a mechanism to detect the link failures in a route and re-establish the connections taking into account the conditions of QoS that have been established during the previous route discovery phase. The simulation results reveal performance improvements in terms of packet delay, number of link failures and connection setup latency while we make more efficient use of the available bandwidth than other protocols like AODV and QAODV. In terms of video transmission, the obtained results prove that the combined use of AQA-AODV and the scalable video coding provides an efficient platform for supporting rate-adaptive video streaming.

 The communications inside MANETs usually show frequent disruptions due to changes in topology and the condition of having a shared physical channel. It is necessary to implement a mechanism to maintain connectivity and ensure Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper we introduce a route recovery mechanism for a QoS routing protocol called AQA-AODV (Adaptive QoS-Aware AODV) which is an extension of the AODV protocol. Our proposal provides a mechanism to detect the link failures in a route and reestablish the connections taking into account the conditions of QoS that have been established during the route discovery phase. The simulation results reveal performance improvements in terms of packet delay, number of link failures and connection setup latency while the end-to-end throughput is not affected compared with the throughput achieved by other protocols like AODV.

 Admission control of flows is essential for providing quality of service in multihop wireless networks. In order to make an admission decision for a new flow, the expected bandwidth consumption of the flow must be correctly determined. Due to the shared nature of the wireless medium, nodes along a multihop path contend among themselves for access to the medium. This leads to intra-flow contention; contention between packets of the same flow being forwarded at different hops along a multihop path causing the actual bandwidth consumption of the flow to become a multiple of its single hop bandwidth requirement. Determining the amount of intra-flow contention is non-trivial since interfering nodes may not be able to communicate directly if they are outside each other's transmission range. In this paper, we propose two methods to determine the extent of intra-flow contention along multihop paths. The highlight of the proposed solutions is that carrier-sensing data is used to deduce information about carrier-sensing neighbors, and no high power transmissions are necessary. Analytical and simulation results show that our methods estimate intra-flow contention with low error, while significantly reducing overhead, energy consumption and latency as compared to previous approaches.

 As mobile networking continues to experience increasing popularity, the need to connect large num- bers of wireless devices will become more prevalent. Many recent proposals for ad hoc routing have certain characteristics which may limit their scalability to large networks. This paper examines five different combinations of modifications which may be incorporated into virtually any on-demand protocol in order to improve its scalability. The scalability of current on-demand routing protocols is evaluated through the selection of a representative from this class of protocols. The performance of the un-modified on-demand protocol is compared against that of it combined with each of the scalability modifications. Each scheme's behavior is analyzed in networks as large as 10,000 nodes through detailed simulation. Based on the observations, conclusions are drawn as to the expected scalability improvement which can be achieved by each modification.

 Due to the unreliable nature of the wireless medium as well as risks of route failure (mobility), supporting quality of service (QoS) in ad hoc networks is a rather challenging task. In this paper, we propose AQuoS, an exclusive framework which provides and ensures QoS in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Compared to existing work, to our knowledge, AQuoS is the only framework which assume different node capacity limits along with considering multi-hopping and carrier sensing interferences for admission control. To extend our contribution, we also developed a new approach which deals with unexpected lost of QoS guarantees. The low complexity of our scheme along with its flexibility makes it highly scalable for MANETs. Through simulations, we show that AQuoS outperforms SWAN protocol, especially when congestion arises

 Ad hoc QoS on-demand routing (AQOR) in mobile ad hoc networks

 We introduce a resource reservation-based routing and signaling algorithm, Ad hoc Qos on-demand routing (AQOR), that provides end-to-end quality of service (QoS) support, in terms of bandwidth and end-to-end delay, in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The increasing use of MANETs for transferring multimedia applications such as voice, video and data, leads to the need to provide QoS support. To perform accurate admission control and resource reservation in AQOR, we have developed detailed computations that allow us to estimate the available bandwidth and end-to-end delay in unsynchronized wireless environment. AQOR also includes efficient mechanisms for QoS maintenance, including temporary reservation and destination-initiated recovery processes. The performance of AQOR is studied in detail by simulation using OPNET Modeler. The results validate that AQOR provides QoS support in ad hoc wireless networks with high reliability and low overhead.

 Existing on-demand ad-hoc routing algorithms initiate route discovery only after a path breaks, incurring a significant cost in detecting the disconnection and establishing a new route. In this work, we investigate adding proactive route selection and maintenance to on-demand ad-hoc routing algorithms. More specifically, when a path is likely to be broken, a warning is sent to the source indicating the likelihood of a disconnection. The source can then initiate path discovery early, potentially avoiding the disconnection altogether. A path is considered likely to break when the received packet power becomes close to the minimum detectable power (other approaches are possible). Care must be taken to avoid initiating false route warnings due to fluctuations in received power caused by fading, multipath effects and similar random transient phenomena. Experiments demonstrate that adding proactive route selection and maintenance to DSR and AODV (on-demand ad hoc routing protocols) significantly reduces the number of broken paths, with a small increase in protocol overhead. Packet latency and jitter also goes down in most cases. We also show some experimental results obtained by running TCP on top of the proactive routing schemes proposed. Several improvements and extensions are also discussed. Pro-active route selection and maintenance is general and can be used with other routing algorithms and optimizations to them. 1.

 Bandwidth-Reservation Mechanism for On-Demand Ad hoc Path Findin.    
   
 Conference Paper    
 May 2002 

 Irina V. Gerasimov

 One of the major challenges faced by designers of ad hoc network systems is the deployment of end-to-end quality-of-service support mechanisms. This paper describes QoS-AODV, an integrated route discovery and bandwidth reservation protocol. QoS-AODV is designed to operate within a TDMA network. Unlike other path finding and route discovery protocols that ignore the impact of the data link layer, QoS-AODV incorporates slot scheduling information to ensure that end-to-end bandwidth is actually reserved. Further, QoS-AODV is an enhanced version of the Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector routing protocol, and is therefore compatible with proposed route discovery and maintenance techniques. In order to test the effectiveness of our protocol we implemented a version of QoS-AODV, along with two similar protocols, in the ns-2 simulator. Our experiments showed the QoS-AODV significantly improved the probability of being able to find an end-to-end QoS path.

 With the success of the Internet and flexibility of MPEG-4 transporting MPEG-4 video over the Internet is expected to be an important component of many multimedia applications in the near future. Video applications typically have delay and loss requirements, which cannot be adequately supported by the current Internet. Thus, it is a challenging problem to design an efficient MPEG-4 video delivery system that can maximize the perceptual quality while achieving high resource utilization. This paper addresses this problem by presenting an end-to-end architecture for transporting MPEG-4 video over the Internet. We present a framework for transporting MPEG-4 video, which includes source rate adaptation, packetization, feedback control, and error control. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) a feedback control algorithm based on the Real Time Protocol (RTP) and the Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP); (2) an adaptive source-encoding algorithm for MPEG-4 video which is able to adjust the output rate of MPEG-4 video to the desired rate; and (3) an efficient and robust packetization algorithm for MPEG video bit-streams at the sync layer for Internet transport. Simulation results show that our end-to-end transport architecture achieves good perceptual picture quality for MPEG-4 video under low bit-rate and varying network conditions and efficiently utilizes network resources

 QoS-Aware Routing Based on Bandwidth Estimation for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks    
   
 Article    
 Apr 2005

 Routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have been explored extensively in recent years. Much of this work is targeted at finding a feasible route from a source to a destination without considering current network traffic or application requirements. Therefore, the network may easily become overloaded with too much traffic and the application has no way to improve its performance under a given network traffic condition. While this may be acceptable for data transfer, many real-time applications require quality-of-service (QoS) support from the network. We believe that such QoS support can be achieved by either finding a route to satisfy the application requirements or offering network feedback to the application when the requirements cannot be met. We propose a QoS-aware routing protocol that incorporates an admission control scheme and a feedback scheme to meet the QoS requirements of real-time applications. The novel part of this QoS-aware routing protocol is the use of the approximate bandwidth estimation to react to network traffic. Our approach implements these schemes by using two bandwidth estimation methods to find the residual bandwidth available at each node to support new streams. We simulate our QoS-aware routing protocol for nodes running the IEEE 802.11 medium access control. Results of our experiments show that the packet delivery ratio increases greatly, and packet delay and energy dissipation decrease significantly, while the overall end-to-end throughput is not impacted, compared with routing protocols that do not provide QoS support.

 Several new architectures have been developed for supporting multimedia applications such as digital video and audio. However quality-of-service (QoS) routing is an important element that is still missing from these architectures. In this paper, we consider a number of issues in QoS routing. We first examine the basic problem of QoS routing, namely, finding a path that satisfies multiple constraints, and its implications on routing metric selection, and then present three path computation algorithms for source routing and for hop-by-hop routing

 Early simulation experience with wireless ad hoc networks suggests that their capacity can be surprisingly low, due to the requirement that nodes forward each others' packets. The achievable capacity depends on network size, traffic patterns, and detailed local radio interactions. This paper examines these factors alone and in combination, using simulation and analysis from first principles. Our results include both specific constants and general scaling relationships helpful in understanding the limitations of wireless ad hoc networks.

  Within ad hoc networks, applications in general, and more specifically those with real-time constraints need to react to rapid variations in network resource availability. Hence, in order to operate correctly at application level, an accurate view on available network resources along computed paths is required. In this paper, we present a new mechanism that notifies instantly to the applications ... [Show full abstract]  about changes occurring on network paths and their QoS characteristics. Our approach is based on an extension of a proactive ad hoc routing protocol that sends detected changes to a configurable "event channel". Then, this channel forwards them selectively to applications using filtering rules. Performed tests show that our mechanism has low impact on the performance of the routing protocol and a real improvement on applications behaviour.

  Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) also called mesh networks, consist of a large number of mobile nodes that communicate with each other in the absence of any fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. The principle characteristics of MANET are the dynamic topology and the limited battery power of mobile nodes. The discharge of the battery causes many problems such as the loss of the ... [Show full abstract]  packets and the re-initialization of route discovery which leads to lot of bandwidth consumption, increase in the delay and decrease in the throughput. In this paper, we propose a new power and delay aware routing protocol for wireless Ad Hoc networks. The goal of our proposed routing protocol is not only to find more stable paths from a source to a destination node in terms of remaining life time of battery, but also to find multi-paths that satisfy Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, given in terms of delay and bandwidth. To evaluate our proposed routing protocol (PDMRP), an extensive simulation study is performed using the NS-2 simulator. We show through simulation that our proposed routing protocol called Power and Delay aware Multi-path Routing Protocol (PDMRP) outperforms the Stable Path Routing Protocol based on Power Awareness (SPR) and the Modified Adhoc On-Demand Distance Vector (MAODV) routing protocols in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, and loss rate. We modify the AODV protocol in NS-2 simulator so that it supports the energy module. We add the energy class to the relay and destination nodes. Therefore, the life time of each node in this protocol decreases when it sends or receives a packet. This modification is made on the AODV protocol to become similar to the two other routing protocols (The three protocols support the energy module).

 27th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions, and Defenses   
  
  Call for Papers  
   
 Since its inception in 1997, the International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (RAID) has established itself as a venue where leading researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and the government are given the opportunity to present novel research in a unique venue to an engaged and lively community.  
 The conference is known for the quality and thoroughness of the reviews of the papers submitted, the desire to build a bridge between research carried out in different communities, and the emphasis given on the need for sound experimental methods and measurement to improve the state of the art in cybersecurity.  
 This year we are soliciting research papers on topics covering all well-motivated computer security problems. We care about techniques that identify new real-world threats, techniques to prevent them, to detect them to mitigate them or to assess their prevalence and their consequences. Measurement papers are encouraged as well as papers offering public access to new tools or datasets, or experience papers that clearly articulate important lessons learned.  
 Specific topics of interest to RAID include, but are not limited to:  
 Computer, network, and cloud computing security 
  Malware and unwanted software 
  Program analysis and reverse engineering 
  Mobile Security 
  Web security and privacy 
  Vulnerability analysis techniques 
  Usable security and privacy 
  Intrusion detection and prevention 
  Hardware security 
  Cyber physical systems security and threats against critical infrastructures 
  IoT security 
  Statistical and adversarial learning for computer security 
  Cyber crime and underground economies 
  Denial-of-Service attacks and defenses 
  Security measurement studies 
  Digital forensics 
  Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. We expect all papers to provide enough detail to enable the reproducibility of their experimental results. We encourage authors to make both the tools and data publicly available.  
 More information is available at https://raid2024.github.io/  .  
 Important Dates  

 Paper Submission Deadline: | April 9  April 15 2024 11:59:59pm  
  Anywhere on earth (UTC-12) 
 Notification to Authors: | June 24 2024 
 Camera Ready Submission Deadline: | July 22 2024 
 Conference: | September 30 - October 2, 2024, Padua, Italy 

  Papers   
 Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format (see ACM Proceedings Template  , using the sigconf style  , e.g., \documentclass[sigconf, review, anonymous]{acmart}), no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.  
   
  The submission site is available here: https://raid2024.hotcrp.com/   

  Submission   
 Reviewing will be double-blind, meaning the authors’ identities will be hidden from the reviewers. All papers will be reviewed by three reviewers and will received notification in 80 days from the submission deadline. No major/minor revision options are allowed. All papers must be appropriately anonymized: author names or affiliations must not appear in the submission, you must refer to your own prior work in the third person, you should not give the paper a title that corresponds to a publicly available technical report, and should anonymize the bibliographic section in an appropriate manner, etc. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. While submitted papers must be anonymous, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper online, disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors or the public, etc. during the review process.  
 All submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that has already been published elsewhere or submitted in parallel to a journal or to any other conference or workshop with proceedings. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work and plagiarism constitute dishonesty or fraud. RAID, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may on the recommendation of the program chair, take action against authors who have committed them. RAID abides with policies for plagiarism, submission confidentiality, reviewer anonymity, and prior and concurrent paper submission.  

 Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations   
 Submissions that describe experiments on human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received approval or a waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (e.g., an IRB). 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If the submission deals with vulnerabilities (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program or design weaknesses in a hardware system), the authors need to discuss in detail the steps they have already taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by disclosing vulnerabilities to the vendors). The same applies if the submission deals with personally identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data. If a paper raises significant ethical and legal concerns, it might be rejected based on these concerns.  
 Authors who are unsure whether their submissions might meet these guidelines, or who have specific questions about the guidelines, are welcome to contact the program committee chair.  
  
  Proceedings by ACM   
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented at RAID 2024 and published at the International Conference Proceedings Series by ACM (ACM ICPS). By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.  
  
  Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model    
 ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program  and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here: https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance  .  
  Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows:  
  Full details of the new ICPS publishing model: https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/faq   
  Full details of the ACM Open program: https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess   
  Please direct all questions about the new model to icps-info@acm.org  .

 Registration  
 RAMiCS 2023 will take place at the Technologiezentrum Augsburg, as a physical conference. There are no conference fees but, due to limited resources, participation is subject to approval by the conference organisers. Please apply for participation by February 28, 2023, by sending an email to roland.glueck@dlr.de  . Please use this email template   .  
 Venue  
 RAMiCS 2023 will be organized by the Institute of Stuctures and Design  of the German Aerospace Center  and will take place in the room "Innovation" at the Technologiezentrum Augsburg  in Augsburg  .  
   Augsburg can be reached by public transport from both Munich airport  and Memmingen airport  . To get to the venue  from Augsburg central station use the tramway line 3 in the direction of "Inninger Straße/Königsbrunn" or "Königsbrunn Zentrum" (the important part is "Königsbrunn") and leave at "Innovationspark/LfU". The venue is on the right in the direction of travel of the tramway. The following hotels are close to the venue: NinetyNine Hotel 
  ANA Style Hotel 
  Haunstetter Hof 
  B&B Augsburg Süd 
  Super 8 Wyndham 
  ANA Gold Hotel 
  The venue is located a little distance outside the center of Augsburg. However, the center is easily reachable via tramway. Simply enter line 3 at "Innovationspark/LfU" in direction "Königsplatz" and leave there. For the ride you can use a single ticket of price-level 2 or - if you plan to ride more often - you can buy a so-called "Streifenkarte" (strip card) in which case you have to use two strips. Both the single tickets and the strip cards can be purchased at vending machines at every station and have to be devaluated by stamping either inside the tramway or at the station. Of course, the price function is symmetric. The last tramway from the center ("Königsplatz") departs at midnight. Unfortunately, the web page of the Augsburg transport association  is only available in German. Program  
 All times in CEST (UTC+2). Speakers are underlined; click on titles to see abstracts.

 10:00 | Session 1. Systems. Chair Bernhard Möller 
 10:00 | Alexander Knapp | Specifying Event/Data-based Systems (invited talk)   Abstract: Event/data-based systems are controlled by events, their local data state may change in reaction to events. Numerous methods and notations for specifying such reactive systems have been designed, though with varying focus on the different development steps and their refinement relations. We first briefly review some of such methods, like temporal/modal logic, TLA, UML state machines, symbolic transition systems, CSP, synchronous languages, and Event-B with their support for parallel composition and refinement. We then present E ↓  -logic for covering a broad range of abstraction levels of event/data-based systems from abstract requirements to constructive specifications in a uniform foundation. E ↓  -logic uses diamond and box modalities over structured events adopted from dynamic logic, for recursive process specifications it offers (control) state variables and binders from hybrid logic. The semantic interpretation relies on event/data transition systems; specification refinement is defined by model class inclusion. Constructive operational specifications given by state transition graphs can be characterised by a single E ↓  -sentence. Also a variety of implementation constructors is available in E ↓  -logic to support, among others, event refinement and parallel composition. Thus the whole development process can rely on E ↓  -logic and its semantics as a common basis. | Slides 
 11:00 | Roland Glück | Compatibility of Refining and Controlling Plant Automata with Bisimulation Quotients (contributed talk)  Abstract: This paper is concerned with the refinement and control of a certain class of labelled transition systems, called plant automata, via bisimulation quotients.Refinement means that arbitrary transitions may be removed whereas control allows only removing edges with the same edge label.The goal is to ensure given LTL properties in the resulting plant automaton.We give a hardness result for refinement and control and investigate, in particular, the question whether refineability and controllability can be decided by looking at bisimulation quotients. | Slides 
 11:30 | Nasos Evangelou-Oost  , Callum Bannister and Ian Hayes | Contextuality in distributed systems (contributed talk)  Abstract: We present a lattice of distributed program specifications, whose ordering represents implementability/refinement.Specifications are modelled by families of subsets of relative execution traces, which encode the local orderings of state transitions, rather than their absolute timing according to a global clock.This is to overcome fundamental physical difficulties with synchronisation.The lattice of specifications is assembled and analysed with several established mathematical tools.Sets of nondegenerate cells of a simplicial set model relative traces, presheaves model the parametrisation of these traces by a topological space of variables, and information algebras reveal novel constraints on program correctness.The latter aspect brings the enterprise of program specification under the widening umbrella of contextual semantics introduced by Abramsky et al.In this model of program specifications, contextuality manifests as a failure of a consistency criterion comparable to Lamport's definition of sequential consistency.The theory of information algebras also suggests efficient local computation algorithms for the verification of this criterion.The novel constructions in this paper have been verified in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. | Slides 
 12:00 | Lunch 
 13:30 | Session 2. Representability. Chair Walter Guttmann 
 13:30 | Wesley Fussner  and Peter Jipsen | Poset Product Representations Over Simple Residuated Lattices (short talk) | Slides 
 13:50 | Rudolf Berghammer  and Michael Winter | A General Method for Representing Sets of Relations by Vectors (contributed talk)  Abstract: We present a general method for computing vector representations $\Fr$ of sets of relations. This method is used for obtaining $\Fr$ from an inclusion $\FR \subseteq \FS$, where $\FR$ and $\FS$ are relation-algebraic expressions over a relation rather than its vector representation. The core of the method is a theorem that shows how $\Fr$ can be obtained from $\FR \subseteq \FS$ in one step. As applications we consider some problems concerning kernels of relations. | Slides 
 14:20 | Peter Jipsen and Jas Semrl | Representable and diagonally representable weakening relation algebras (contributed talk)  Abstract: Weakening relations are all binary relations defined on a poset such that the partial order acts as a both-sided compositional identity. This is motivated by the weakening rule in sequent calculi and closely related to models of relevance logic. For a fixed poset the collection of weakening relations is a subreduct of the full relation algebra on the underlying set of the poset. We present a two-player game for the class of representable weakening relation algebras akin to that for the class of representable relation algebras. This enables us to define classes of abstract weakening relation algebras that approximate the quasivariety of representable weakening relation algebras. We give explicit finite axiomatisations for some of these classes. We define the class of diagonally representable weakening relation algebras and prove that it is a discriminator variety. We also provide explicit representations for several small weakening relation algebras. | Slides

 15:40 | Jesse Sigal  and Chris Heunen | Duoidally enriched Freyd categories (contributed talk)  Abstract: Freyd categories provide a semantics for first-order effectful programming languages by capturing the two different orders of evaluation for products. We enrich Freyd categories in a duoidal category, which provides a new, third choice of parallel composition. Duoidal categories have two monoidal structures which account for the sequential and parallel compositions. The traditional setting is recovered as a full coreflective subcategory for a judicious choice of duoidal category. We give several worked examples of this uniform framework, including the parametrised state monad, basic separation semantics for resources, and interesting cases of change of enrichment. | Slides

 09:00 | Tobias Kappé | Completeness and the Finite Model Property for Kleene Algebra, Reconsidered (contributed talk)  Abstract: Kleene Algebra (KA) is the algebra of regular expressions. Central to the study of KA is Kozen's (1994) completeness result, which says that any equivalence valid in the language model of KA follows from the axioms of KA. Also of interest is the finite model property (FMP), which says that false equivalences always have a finite counterexample. Palka (2005) showed that, for KA, the FMP is equivalent to completeness.We provide a unified and elementary proof of both properties. In contrast with earlier completeness proofs, this proof does not rely on minimality or bisimilarity techniques for deterministic automata. Instead, our approach avoids deterministic automata altogether, and uses Antimirov's derivatives and the well-known transition monoid construction.Our results are fully verified in the Coq proof assistant. | Slides 
 09:30 | Igor Sedlár | On the Complexity of *-Continuous Kleene Algebra With Domain (contributed talk)  Abstract: We prove that the equational theory of *-continuous Kleene algebra with domain is EXPTIME-complete.

In a previous work, we provided the classification of the amalgamation property (AP) for the varieties of BL-algebras generated by one BL-chain with finitely-many components. As an open problem, we left the analysis of the AP for varieties of BL-algebras generated by one finite set of BL-chains with finitely-many components. In this paper we provide a partial solution to this problem. We provide a classification of the AP for the varieties of BL-algebras generated by one finite set of BL-chains with finitely-many components, which are either cancellative hoops or finite Wajsberg hoops. We also discuss the difficulties to generalize this approach to the more general case. | Slides

We prove a representation of elements of (K (x) C2') by automata a la Kleene and refine it by normal form theorems that restrict the occurrences of brackets on paths through the automata. This is the basis for a calculus of context-free expressions. | Slides

 13:30 | Valeria Vignudelli | Equational Theories and Distances for Computational Effects (invited talk)   Abstract: Computational effects such as nondeterminism and probabilities can be abstractly modelled in category theory as monads, and can be syntactically described in universal algebra via equational theories. Equational theories allow us to reason on the equivalence of programs with computational effects. In recent years, much work has been devoted to the development of techniques to reason not only on program equivalence, but also on program distances. The correspondence between monads and equational theories has been extended to capture such notions of distances, via the framework of quantitative equational theories. In this talk, I will present such correspondence between monads and equational theories, as well as recent results applying the framework of quantitative equational theories to computational effects and distances on them. I will show several examples of axiomatizations, including more involved cases such as the combination of nondeterminism, probabilities and termination. | Slides

Alm, David Andrews and Michael Levet | Comer Schemes, Relation Algebras, and the Flexible Atom Conjecture (contributed talk)  Abstract: In this paper, we consider relational structures arising from Comer's finite field construction, where the cosets need not be sum free. These Comer schemes generalize the notion of a Ramsey scheme and may be of independent interest. As an application, we give the first finite representation of $34_{65}$. We complement our upper bounds with some lower bounds. Using a SAT solver, we establish that $33_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points and $34_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points. | Slides 
 15:30 | José Gil-Férez  , Peter Jipsen and Siddhartha Lodhia | The structure of locally integral involutive po-monoids and semirings (contributed talk)  Abstract: We show that every locally integral involutive partially ordered monoid (ipo-monoid) $\mathbf A = (A,\le, \cdot, 1, \sim, -)$, and in particular every locally integral involutive semiring, decomposes in a unique way into a family $\{\mathbf A_p : p\in A^+\}$ of integral ipo-monoids, which we call its \emph{integral components}. In the semiring case, the integral components are semirings. Moreover, we show that there is a family of monoidal homomorphisms $\Phi = \{\varphi_{pq}\colon \mathbf A_p\to \mathbf A_q : p\leq q\}$, indexed on the positive cone $(A^+,\leq)$, so that the structure of $\mathbf A$ can be recovered as a glueing $\int_\Phi \mathbf A_p$ of its integral components along $\Phi$. Reciprocally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions so that the P\l{}onka sum of any family of integral ipo-monoids $\{\mathbf A_p : p\in D\}$, indexed on a lower-bounded join-semilattice $(D,\vee, 1)$, along a family of monoidal homomorphisms $\Phi$ is an ipo-monoid. | Slides 
 16:00 | Andrew Lewis-Smith  and Jas Semrl | Implication Algebras and Implication Semigroups of Binary Relations (contributed talk)  Abstract: Implication algebras are known to be axiomatised by a finite number of equations (making the representation and finite representation problems decidable in that case). We show that this also holds in the context of unary (and binary) relations and present a Stone-style representation theorem. We then show that the (finite) representation decision problem is undecidable for implication semigroups, in stark contrast with implication algebras. | Slides

 09:10 | Laura Kovács and Anton Varonka | What Else is Undecidable about Loops? (contributed talk)  Abstract: We address algebraic aspects of invariant generation and proving termination, two central questions of program analysis, for non-deterministic loops with polynomial updates. Our focus is sketching the boundary of (un-)decidability for both problems between different classes of programs. The first main contribution of this work is related to the question raised by Braverman in 2006: ``How much non-determinism can be introduced in a linear loop before termination becomes undecidable?'' We show that termination of loops with a purely non-deterministic choice between linear updates is undecidable in the presence of linear inequality loop conditions. In the context of invariants, an algorithm is known that computes all polynomial relations among variables of loops with multiple linear updates. At the same time, allowing polynomial assignments of higher degrees was shown to result in algorithmic unsolvability. We highlight that negative results in fact do not exploit general polynomial updates. We show that no algorithm can find all polynomial relations for programs as soon as quadratic updates or updates guarded by affine equalities are involved. | Slides

 11:00 | John Stell | Algebra and Logic in Granularity (invited talk)   Abstract: Conceptually, a relation on a set can be understood as a lens through which subsets are seen in different ways. For example, at different levels of detail. This idea underlies some basic operations in mathematical morphology as used in image processing. In a more abstract setting, the idea also fits one view of quantale modules, where a quantale acting on a complete lattice models the operation of observing elements of the lattice by means of the elements of quantale. This talk will consider the role of relations, and their generalizations, in the development of a theory of granularity, or level of detail. Starting from basic mathematical morphology, algebraic and logical structures motivated by extensions of this will be discussed. To explain the starting point, mathematical morphology is a body of techniques used in image processing since the 1960s. The algebraic basis of these techniques is already well-known through the work of Serra, Heijmans, Ronse, and others. A black and white image can be seen as a subset of a set of pixels. Operations mapping subsets to subsets provide ways of modifying images. Such operations arise from relations on the underlying set. Algebraically, a binary relation induces an adjunction yielding the dilation (left, or lower, adjoint) and erosion (right, or upper, adjoint) operations used in image processing. From these are derived openings and closings. Families of openings and closings are used to build ''alternating sequential filters'', ''granulometries'' and further practically useful operations. Mathematical morphology was extended from sets of pixels to graphs and subgraphs. The appropriate notion of relation to deal with this was identified, and these can be seen as quantale-enriched distributors. A quite separate application of quantales to mathematical morphology was developed by Russo. The talk will discuss connections between these accounts. | Slides

 09:30 | Walter Guttmann | Dependences between Domain Constructions in Heterogeneous Relation Algebras (contributed talk)  Abstract: We show the following dependences between relational domain constructions in the framework of heterogeneous relation algebras. If all power sets and subsets exist and objects are comparable, then all sums exist. If all sums exist and atoms are rectangular, then all products exist. If all atoms are rectangular, then all subsets exist if and only if all quotients exist. We give models with rectangular atoms which rule out further dependences between these constructions. | Slides 
 10:00 | Michael Winter | Relational Algebraic Approach to the Real Numbers - The Additive Group (contributed talk)  Abstract: In this paper we start the investigation of an object representing the real numbers in categories of relations. Our axiomatization uses the construction of a relation power, i.e., an abstract version of power sets within the category. This allows us to utilize a relation algebraic version of Tarski's axioms of the real numbers as a first-order definition of a real number object. The current paper focuses on the addition operation of the real number object. It is shown that addition forms a densely and linearly ordered abelian group. | Slides

Basic structures and both natural and contingent semantic operations are defined. Conversion rules are represented as a class of ternary relations with both group-like and category-like properties. A hierarchy of subclasses is explored, with increasingly benign algebraic behavior, culminating in a direct efficient conversion-by-rewriting algorithm. | Slides

 Registration  
 RAMiCS 2023 will take place at the Technologiezentrum Augsburg, as a physical conference. There are no conference fees but, due to limited resources, participation is subject to approval by the conference organisers. Please apply for participation by February 28, 2023, by sending an email to roland.glueck@dlr.de  . Please use this email template   .  
 Venue  
 RAMiCS 2023 will be organized by the Institute of Stuctures and Design  of the German Aerospace Center  and will take place in the room "Innovation" at the Technologiezentrum Augsburg  in Augsburg  .  
   Augsburg can be reached by public transport from both Munich airport  and Memmingen airport  . To get to the venue  from Augsburg central station use the tramway line 3 in the direction of "Inninger Straße/Königsbrunn" or "Königsbrunn Zentrum" (the important part is "Königsbrunn") and leave at "Innovationspark/LfU". The venue is on the right in the direction of travel of the tramway. The following hotels are close to the venue: NinetyNine Hotel 
  ANA Style Hotel 
  Haunstetter Hof 
  B&B Augsburg Süd 
  Super 8 Wyndham 
  ANA Gold Hotel 
  The venue is located a little distance outside the center of Augsburg. However, the center is easily reachable via tramway. Simply enter line 3 at "Innovationspark/LfU" in direction "Königsplatz" and leave there. For the ride you can use a single ticket of price-level 2 or - if you plan to ride more often - you can buy a so-called "Streifenkarte" (strip card) in which case you have to use two strips. Both the single tickets and the strip cards can be purchased at vending machines at every station and have to be devaluated by stamping either inside the tramway or at the station. Of course, the price function is symmetric. The last tramway from the center ("Königsplatz") departs at midnight. Unfortunately, the web page of the Augsburg transport association  is only available in German. Program  
 All times in CEST (UTC+2). Speakers are underlined; click on titles to see abstracts.

 10:00 | Session 1. Systems. Chair Bernhard Möller 
 10:00 | Alexander Knapp | Specifying Event/Data-based Systems (invited talk)   Abstract: Event/data-based systems are controlled by events, their local data state may change in reaction to events. Numerous methods and notations for specifying such reactive systems have been designed, though with varying focus on the different development steps and their refinement relations. We first briefly review some of such methods, like temporal/modal logic, TLA, UML state machines, symbolic transition systems, CSP, synchronous languages, and Event-B with their support for parallel composition and refinement. We then present E ↓  -logic for covering a broad range of abstraction levels of event/data-based systems from abstract requirements to constructive specifications in a uniform foundation. E ↓  -logic uses diamond and box modalities over structured events adopted from dynamic logic, for recursive process specifications it offers (control) state variables and binders from hybrid logic. The semantic interpretation relies on event/data transition systems; specification refinement is defined by model class inclusion. Constructive operational specifications given by state transition graphs can be characterised by a single E ↓  -sentence. Also a variety of implementation constructors is available in E ↓  -logic to support, among others, event refinement and parallel composition. Thus the whole development process can rely on E ↓  -logic and its semantics as a common basis. | Slides 
 11:00 | Roland Glück | Compatibility of Refining and Controlling Plant Automata with Bisimulation Quotients (contributed talk)  Abstract: This paper is concerned with the refinement and control of a certain class of labelled transition systems, called plant automata, via bisimulation quotients.Refinement means that arbitrary transitions may be removed whereas control allows only removing edges with the same edge label.The goal is to ensure given LTL properties in the resulting plant automaton.We give a hardness result for refinement and control and investigate, in particular, the question whether refineability and controllability can be decided by looking at bisimulation quotients. | Slides 
 11:30 | Nasos Evangelou-Oost  , Callum Bannister and Ian Hayes | Contextuality in distributed systems (contributed talk)  Abstract: We present a lattice of distributed program specifications, whose ordering represents implementability/refinement.Specifications are modelled by families of subsets of relative execution traces, which encode the local orderings of state transitions, rather than their absolute timing according to a global clock.This is to overcome fundamental physical difficulties with synchronisation.The lattice of specifications is assembled and analysed with several established mathematical tools.Sets of nondegenerate cells of a simplicial set model relative traces, presheaves model the parametrisation of these traces by a topological space of variables, and information algebras reveal novel constraints on program correctness.The latter aspect brings the enterprise of program specification under the widening umbrella of contextual semantics introduced by Abramsky et al.In this model of program specifications, contextuality manifests as a failure of a consistency criterion comparable to Lamport's definition of sequential consistency.The theory of information algebras also suggests efficient local computation algorithms for the verification of this criterion.The novel constructions in this paper have been verified in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. | Slides

 13:50 | Rudolf Berghammer  and Michael Winter | A General Method for Representing Sets of Relations by Vectors (contributed talk)  Abstract: We present a general method for computing vector representations $\Fr$ of sets of relations. This method is used for obtaining $\Fr$ from an inclusion $\FR \subseteq \FS$, where $\FR$ and $\FS$ are relation-algebraic expressions over a relation rather than its vector representation. The core of the method is a theorem that shows how $\Fr$ can be obtained from $\FR \subseteq \FS$ in one step. As applications we consider some problems concerning kernels of relations. | Slides 
 14:20 | Peter Jipsen and Jas Semrl | Representable and diagonally representable weakening relation algebras (contributed talk)  Abstract: Weakening relations are all binary relations defined on a poset such that the partial order acts as a both-sided compositional identity. This is motivated by the weakening rule in sequent calculi and closely related to models of relevance logic. For a fixed poset the collection of weakening relations is a subreduct of the full relation algebra on the underlying set of the poset. We present a two-player game for the class of representable weakening relation algebras akin to that for the class of representable relation algebras. This enables us to define classes of abstract weakening relation algebras that approximate the quasivariety of representable weakening relation algebras. We give explicit finite axiomatisations for some of these classes. We define the class of diagonally representable weakening relation algebras and prove that it is a discriminator variety. We also provide explicit representations for several small weakening relation algebras. | Slides

Central to the study of KA is Kozen's (1994) completeness result, which says that any equivalence valid in the language model of KA follows from the axioms of KA. Also of interest is the finite model property (FMP), which says that false equivalences always have a finite counterexample. Palka (2005) showed that, for KA, the FMP is equivalent to completeness.We provide a unified and elementary proof of both properties. In contrast with earlier completeness proofs, this proof does not rely on minimality or bisimilarity techniques for deterministic automata. Instead, our approach avoids deterministic automata altogether, and uses Antimirov's derivatives and the well-known transition monoid construction.Our results are fully verified in the Coq proof assistant. | Slides

We provide a classification of the AP for the varieties of BL-algebras generated by one finite set of BL-chains with finitely-many components, which are either cancellative hoops or finite Wajsberg hoops. We also discuss the difficulties to generalize this approach to the more general case. | Slides

 13:30 | Valeria Vignudelli | Equational Theories and Distances for Computational Effects (invited talk)   Abstract: Computational effects such as nondeterminism and probabilities can be abstractly modelled in category theory as monads, and can be syntactically described in universal algebra via equational theories. Equational theories allow us to reason on the equivalence of programs with computational effects. In recent years, much work has been devoted to the development of techniques to reason not only on program equivalence, but also on program distances. The correspondence between monads and equational theories has been extended to capture such notions of distances, via the framework of quantitative equational theories. In this talk, I will present such correspondence between monads and equational theories, as well as recent results applying the framework of quantitative equational theories to computational effects and distances on them. I will show several examples of axiomatizations, including more involved cases such as the combination of nondeterminism, probabilities and termination. | Slides

Alm, David Andrews and Michael Levet | Comer Schemes, Relation Algebras, and the Flexible Atom Conjecture (contributed talk)  Abstract: In this paper, we consider relational structures arising from Comer's finite field construction, where the cosets need not be sum free. These Comer schemes generalize the notion of a Ramsey scheme and may be of independent interest. As an application, we give the first finite representation of $34_{65}$. We complement our upper bounds with some lower bounds. Using a SAT solver, we establish that $33_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points and $34_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points. | Slides 
 15:30 | José Gil-Férez  , Peter Jipsen and Siddhartha Lodhia | The structure of locally integral involutive po-monoids and semirings (contributed talk)  Abstract: We show that every locally integral involutive partially ordered monoid (ipo-monoid) $\mathbf A = (A,\le, \cdot, 1, \sim, -)$, and in particular every locally integral involutive semiring, decomposes in a unique way into a family $\{\mathbf A_p : p\in A^+\}$ of integral ipo-monoids, which we call its \emph{integral components}. In the semiring case, the integral components are semirings. Moreover, we show that there is a family of monoidal homomorphisms $\Phi = \{\varphi_{pq}\colon \mathbf A_p\to \mathbf A_q : p\leq q\}$, indexed on the positive cone $(A^+,\leq)$, so that the structure of $\mathbf A$ can be recovered as a glueing $\int_\Phi \mathbf A_p$ of its integral components along $\Phi$. Reciprocally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions so that the P\l{}onka sum of any family of integral ipo-monoids $\{\mathbf A_p : p\in D\}$, indexed on a lower-bounded join-semilattice $(D,\vee, 1)$, along a family of monoidal homomorphisms $\Phi$ is an ipo-monoid. | Slides 
 16:00 | Andrew Lewis-Smith  and Jas Semrl | Implication Algebras and Implication Semigroups of Binary Relations (contributed talk)  Abstract: Implication algebras are known to be axiomatised by a finite number of equations (making the representation and finite representation problems decidable in that case). We show that this also holds in the context of unary (and binary) relations and present a Stone-style representation theorem. We then show that the (finite) representation decision problem is undecidable for implication semigroups, in stark contrast with implication algebras. | Slides

 09:10 | Laura Kovács and Anton Varonka | What Else is Undecidable about Loops? (contributed talk)  Abstract: We address algebraic aspects of invariant generation and proving termination, two central questions of program analysis, for non-deterministic loops with polynomial updates. Our focus is sketching the boundary of (un-)decidability for both problems between different classes of programs. The first main contribution of this work is related to the question raised by Braverman in 2006: ``How much non-determinism can be introduced in a linear loop before termination becomes undecidable?'' We show that termination of loops with a purely non-deterministic choice between linear updates is undecidable in the presence of linear inequality loop conditions. In the context of invariants, an algorithm is known that computes all polynomial relations among variables of loops with multiple linear updates. At the same time, allowing polynomial assignments of higher degrees was shown to result in algorithmic unsolvability. We highlight that negative results in fact do not exploit general polynomial updates. We show that no algorithm can find all polynomial relations for programs as soon as quadratic updates or updates guarded by affine equalities are involved. | Slides

 11:00 | John Stell | Algebra and Logic in Granularity (invited talk)   Abstract: Conceptually, a relation on a set can be understood as a lens through which subsets are seen in different ways. For example, at different levels of detail. This idea underlies some basic operations in mathematical morphology as used in image processing. In a more abstract setting, the idea also fits one view of quantale modules, where a quantale acting on a complete lattice models the operation of observing elements of the lattice by means of the elements of quantale. This talk will consider the role of relations, and their generalizations, in the development of a theory of granularity, or level of detail. Starting from basic mathematical morphology, algebraic and logical structures motivated by extensions of this will be discussed. To explain the starting point, mathematical morphology is a body of techniques used in image processing since the 1960s. The algebraic basis of these techniques is already well-known through the work of Serra, Heijmans, Ronse, and others. A black and white image can be seen as a subset of a set of pixels. Operations mapping subsets to subsets provide ways of modifying images. Such operations arise from relations on the underlying set. Algebraically, a binary relation induces an adjunction yielding the dilation (left, or lower, adjoint) and erosion (right, or upper, adjoint) operations used in image processing. From these are derived openings and closings. Families of openings and closings are used to build ''alternating sequential filters'', ''granulometries'' and further practically useful operations. Mathematical morphology was extended from sets of pixels to graphs and subgraphs. The appropriate notion of relation to deal with this was identified, and these can be seen as quantale-enriched distributors. A quite separate application of quantales to mathematical morphology was developed by Russo. The talk will discuss connections between these accounts. | Slides

If all power sets and subsets exist and objects are comparable, then all sums exist. If all sums exist and atoms are rectangular, then all products exist. If all atoms are rectangular, then all subsets exist if and only if all quotients exist. We give models with rectangular atoms which rule out further dependences between these constructions. | Slides 
 10:00 | Michael Winter | Relational Algebraic Approach to the Real Numbers - The Additive Group (contributed talk)  Abstract: In this paper we start the investigation of an object representing the real numbers in categories of relations. Our axiomatization uses the construction of a relation power, i.e., an abstract version of power sets within the category. This allows us to utilize a relation algebraic version of Tarski's axioms of the real numbers as a first-order definition of a real number object. The current paper focuses on the addition operation of the real number object. It is shown that addition forms a densely and linearly ordered abelian group. | Slides

Basic structures and both natural and contingent semantic operations are defined. Conversion rules are represented as a class of ternary relations with both group-like and category-like properties. A hierarchy of subclasses is explored, with increasingly benign algebraic behavior, culminating in a direct efficient conversion-by-rewriting algorithm. | Slides

 27th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions, and Defenses   
  
  Call for Papers  
   
 Since its inception in 1997, the International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (RAID) has established itself as a venue where leading researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and the government are given the opportunity to present novel research in a unique venue to an engaged and lively community.  
 The conference is known for the quality and thoroughness of the reviews of the papers submitted, the desire to build a bridge between research carried out in different communities, and the emphasis given on the need for sound experimental methods and measurement to improve the state of the art in cybersecurity.  
 This year we are soliciting research papers on topics covering all well-motivated computer security problems. We care about techniques that identify new real-world threats, techniques to prevent them, to detect them to mitigate them or to assess their prevalence and their consequences. Measurement papers are encouraged as well as papers offering public access to new tools or datasets, or experience papers that clearly articulate important lessons learned.  
 Specific topics of interest to RAID include, but are not limited to:  
 Computer, network, and cloud computing security 
  Malware and unwanted software 
  Program analysis and reverse engineering 
  Mobile Security 
  Web security and privacy 
  Vulnerability analysis techniques 
  Usable security and privacy 
  Intrusion detection and prevention 
  Hardware security 
  Cyber physical systems security and threats against critical infrastructures 
  IoT security 
  Statistical and adversarial learning for computer security 
  Cyber crime and underground economies 
  Denial-of-Service attacks and defenses 
  Security measurement studies 
  Digital forensics 
  Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. We expect all papers to provide enough detail to enable the reproducibility of their experimental results. We encourage authors to make both the tools and data publicly available.

 Camera Ready Submission Deadline: | July 22 2024 
 Conference: | September 30 - October 2, 2024, Padua, Italy 

  Papers   
 Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format (see ACM Proceedings Template  , using the sigconf style  , e.g., \documentclass[sigconf, review, anonymous]{acmart}), no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.  
   
  The submission site is available here: https://raid2024.hotcrp.com/   

  Submission   
 Reviewing will be double-blind, meaning the authors’ identities will be hidden from the reviewers. All papers will be reviewed by three reviewers and will received notification in 80 days from the submission deadline. No major/minor revision options are allowed. All papers must be appropriately anonymized: author names or affiliations must not appear in the submission, you must refer to your own prior work in the third person, you should not give the paper a title that corresponds to a publicly available technical report, and should anonymize the bibliographic section in an appropriate manner, etc. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. While submitted papers must be anonymous, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper online, disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors or the public, etc. during the review process.  
 All submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that has already been published elsewhere or submitted in parallel to a journal or to any other conference or workshop with proceedings. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work and plagiarism constitute dishonesty or fraud. RAID, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may on the recommendation of the program chair, take action against authors who have committed them. RAID abides with policies for plagiarism, submission confidentiality, reviewer anonymity, and prior and concurrent paper submission.  

 Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations   
 Submissions that describe experiments on human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received approval or a waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (e.g., an IRB). 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If the submission deals with vulnerabilities (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program or design weaknesses in a hardware system), the authors need to discuss in detail the steps they have already taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by disclosing vulnerabilities to the vendors). The same applies if the submission deals with personally identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data. If a paper raises significant ethical and legal concerns, it might be rejected based on these concerns.  
 Authors who are unsure whether their submissions might meet these guidelines, or who have specific questions about the guidelines, are welcome to contact the program committee chair.  
  
  Proceedings by ACM   
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented at RAID 2024 and published at the International Conference Proceedings Series by ACM (ACM ICPS). By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.  
  
  Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model    
 ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program  and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here: https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance  .

  Trustworthy AI... for Systems Security    
  Abstract:  No day goes by without reading machine learning (ML) success stories across various application areas. Systems security is no exception, where ML’s tantalizing performance leave one to wonder whether there are any unsolved problems left. However, machine learning has no clairvoyant abilities and once the magic wears off, we’re left in uncharted territory. Is machine learning truly capable of ensuring systems security? In this keynote, we will take malware research as a representative example of a long-studied, thriving, yet challenging subject and, after offering a quick historical perspective, we will illustrate some of the open issues that are affecting learning-based malware models. When relevant, we will also delve into behind-the-scenes aspects to encourage reflection on the reproducibility crisis. Our goal is to foster a deeper understanding of machine learning’s role in systems security along with a discussion on promising directions the research community is and should be pursuing to address such challenges and open problems.

  How to Solve Cybersecurity Once and For All    
  Abstract:  In Pwn2Own this year, a single person (Manfred Paul) demonstrated successful exploits for all major browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Chrome alone is used by 3.5 *billion* people. Today, thanks to Paul, these major security flaws are fixed. Last year, evidently, the majority of people in the world accessed the internet with the door open to potential attackers—despite decades of research in defensive security, despite an abundance of mitigations, despite dedicated red teams. -- But why? Software is entirely virtual and can be described completely: A program’s source code is meant to formally express the programmer’s intention using the syntactic and semantic rules of the programming language. As the behavior of a software system arises from well-defined instructions, we must be able to formally reason about all its properties. Surely there exists an approach that will forever guarantee the security of our systems. Only, we haven't found it, yet?  
   
  In this keynote, I will explore what fundamentally prevents us from making reliable statements about the security of a software system. I will try to substantiate each argument by demonstrating how the corresponding challenge in our defensive strategies is routinely exploited to attack a system despite credible assurances about the absence of security flaws. After the successful deconstruction of the prevalent philosophy, I will introduce a philosophy of vulnerability-guided hardening, where we seek to falsify claims of security using successful attacks as counterexamples.  
   
  Bio:  Marcel Böhme leads the Software Security research group at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP) in Germany. His group is interested in the automatic discovery of security flaws in software systems at the very large scale. Apart from the development of practical techniques for vulnerability discovery (incl., fuzzing), his group seeks to identify fundamental limits of existing techniques, studies empirical methods (incl. statistical and causal reasoning) for program analysis, and explores the assurances that software testing provides when no bugs are found.

 27th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions, and Defenses   
  
  Call for Papers  
   
 Since its inception in 1997, the International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (RAID) has established itself as a venue where leading researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and the government are given the opportunity to present novel research in a unique venue to an engaged and lively community.  
 The conference is known for the quality and thoroughness of the reviews of the papers submitted, the desire to build a bridge between research carried out in different communities, and the emphasis given on the need for sound experimental methods and measurement to improve the state of the art in cybersecurity.  
 This year we are soliciting research papers on topics covering all well-motivated computer security problems. We care about techniques that identify new real-world threats, techniques to prevent them, to detect them to mitigate them or to assess their prevalence and their consequences. Measurement papers are encouraged as well as papers offering public access to new tools or datasets, or experience papers that clearly articulate important lessons learned.  
 Specific topics of interest to RAID include, but are not limited to:  
 Computer, network, and cloud computing security 
  Malware and unwanted software 
  Program analysis and reverse engineering 
  Mobile Security 
  Web security and privacy 
  Vulnerability analysis techniques 
  Usable security and privacy 
  Intrusion detection and prevention 
  Hardware security 
  Cyber physical systems security and threats against critical infrastructures 
  IoT security 
  Statistical and adversarial learning for computer security 
  Cyber crime and underground economies 
  Denial-of-Service attacks and defenses 
  Security measurement studies 
  Digital forensics 
  Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. We expect all papers to provide enough detail to enable the reproducibility of their experimental results. We encourage authors to make both the tools and data publicly available.

 Important Dates  

 Paper Submission Deadline: | April 9  April 15 2024 11:59:59pm  
  Anywhere on earth (UTC-12) 
 Notification to Authors: | June 24 2024 
 Camera Ready Submission Deadline: | July 22 2024 
 Conference: | September 30 - October 2, 2024, Padua, Italy 

  Papers   
 Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format (see ACM Proceedings Template  , using the sigconf style  , e.g., \documentclass[sigconf, review, anonymous]{acmart}), no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.  
   
  The submission site is available here: https://raid2024.hotcrp.com/   

  Submission   
 Reviewing will be double-blind, meaning the authors’ identities will be hidden from the reviewers. All papers will be reviewed by three reviewers and will received notification in 80 days from the submission deadline. No major/minor revision options are allowed. All papers must be appropriately anonymized: author names or affiliations must not appear in the submission, you must refer to your own prior work in the third person, you should not give the paper a title that corresponds to a publicly available technical report, and should anonymize the bibliographic section in an appropriate manner, etc. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. While submitted papers must be anonymous, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper online, disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors or the public, etc. during the review process.  
 All submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that has already been published elsewhere or submitted in parallel to a journal or to any other conference or workshop with proceedings. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work and plagiarism constitute dishonesty or fraud. RAID, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may on the recommendation of the program chair, take action against authors who have committed them. RAID abides with policies for plagiarism, submission confidentiality, reviewer anonymity, and prior and concurrent paper submission.  

 Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations   
 Submissions that describe experiments on human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received approval or a waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (e.g., an IRB). 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If the submission deals with vulnerabilities (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program or design weaknesses in a hardware system), the authors need to discuss in detail the steps they have already taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by disclosing vulnerabilities to the vendors). The same applies if the submission deals with personally identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data. If a paper raises significant ethical and legal concerns, it might be rejected based on these concerns.  
 Authors who are unsure whether their submissions might meet these guidelines, or who have specific questions about the guidelines, are welcome to contact the program committee chair.  
  
  Proceedings by ACM   
 Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented at RAID 2024 and published at the International Conference Proceedings Series by ACM (ACM ICPS). By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.  
  
  Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model    
 ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program  and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here: https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance  .  
  Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows:

 Awards  
   
 RAID will give two types of paper awards. In addition to the Best Paper award  , which recognizes the best overall research from among the accepted papers  , there will be the Best Practical Paper award.  Our aim  for this award is to raise awareness of research advances  among security practitioners. This award recognizes a paper that would be impactful and easy to adopt in practice.

 19 - 23 August 2024, Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science (RAMiCS), Prague, Czechia  
 Date: 19 - 23 August 2024   
 Time: 23:59   
 Location: Prague, Czechia   
 Deadline: Friday 14 June 2024   
 Since 1994, the RAMiCS conference series has been the main venue for theory surrounding relation algebra. Theoretical aspects include semigroups, residuated lattices, semirings, Kleene algebras, quantales and other algebras; their connections with program logics and other logics; their use in the theories of automata, concurrency, formal languages, games, networks and programming languages; the development of algebraic, algorithmic, category-theoretic, coalgebraic and proof-theoretic methods for these theories; their formalisation with theorem provers.  
 Applications include tools and techniques for program correctness, specification and verification; quantitative and qualitative models and semantics of computing systems and processes; algorithm design, automated reasoning, network protocol analysis, social choice, optimisation and control.  
   
 We are calling for submission of original work not published or under review for publication elsewhere. The proceedings will be published as part of Springer LNCS. As for earlier RAMiCS conferences, we intend to publish a journal special issue with revised and extended versions of a selection of the best papers. Deadline: 16 February 2024.  
 Additionally to the standard CfP, RAMiCS is also calling for short contributions and posters. We are hence calling for presentations of original, unfinished, already published, or otherwise interesting work within the topics of the RAMiCS conferences. The submission can be in the form of a poster, an abstract, a paper submitted to or published at another conference, or any other format. Short contributions will *not* be published in the conference proceedings. Deadline: 14 June 2024.  
   
 For more information, see https://ramics-conf.github.io/2024/  or contact Uli Fahrenberg at fahrenberg at  gmail.com  .

 RANLP (Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing)  is one of the most influential and competitive NLP conferences. The event is held biennially and grew out of the International Summer schools “Contemporary topics in Computational Linguistics” which were organised for many years as international training events. Previous RANLP conferences (1995, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023) featured keynote talks by leading experts in NLP as well as presentations/papers of high quality, rigorously reviewed by a Programme Committee of well-known researchers. After 2009, the papers accepted at RANLP and the associated workshops have been included in the ACL Anthology. The RANLP proceedings are indexed by SCOPUS and DBLP. The Proceedings has its own Scopus SJR, in 2023 it is 0,299. The conference will be preceded by a Summer School on Deep Learning and Large Language Models in NLP as well as 4-6 tutorials on current topics of particular interest and cutting edge technologies. RANLP 2025 will be followed by selected workshops on specialised NLP topics as well as shared tasks. A Student Research Workshop will be held in parallel with the main conference. The Student Research Workshops (now 9 th  edition) have become active discussion fora for young researchers.  
  Expected conference submission deadline: end of April/beginning of May 2025  (please regularly check http://ranlp.org/ranlp2025/   for updated information)  
 Call for shared tasks proposals: September 2024

 AIMS AND GOALS  
 Privacy in statistical databases is about finding tradeoffs to the tension between the increasing societal and economic demand for accurate information and the legal and ethical obligation to protect the privacy of individuals and enterprises which are the respondents providing the statistical data. In the case of statistical databases, the motivation for respondent privacy is one of survival: data collectors cannot expect to collect accurate information from individual or corporate respondents unless these feel the privacy of their responses is guaranteed.  
 Beyond respondent privacy, there are two additional privacy dimensions to be considered: privacy for the data owners (organizations owning or gathering the data, who would not like to share the data they have collected at great expense) and privacy for the users (those who submit queries to the database and would like their analyses to stay private).  
 "Privacy in Statistical Databases 2024" (PSD 2024) is a conference organized by the CRISES research group  at Universitat Rovira i Virgili  with proceedings published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in Computer Science. The purpose of PSD 2024 is to attract world-wide, high-level research in statistical database privacy.  
 PSD2024 is a successor to PSD 2022  (Paris), PSD 2020  (Tarragona), PSD 2018  (València), PSD 2016  (Dubrovnik), PSD 2014  (Eivissa), PSD 2012  (Palermo), PSD 2010  (Corfu), PSD 2008  (Istanbul), PSD 2006  (Rome) and PSD 2004  (Barcelona), all with proceedings published by Springer in LNCS 13463, LNCS 12276, LNCS 11126, LNCS 9867, LNCS 8744, LNCS 7556, LNCS 6344, LNCS 5262, LNCS 4302 and LNCS 3050, respectively. Those ten PSD conferences follow a tradition of high-quality technical conferences on SDC which started with "Statistical Data Protection-SDP'98", held in Lisbon in 1998 and with proceedings published by OPOCE, and continued with the AMRADS project SDC Workshop, held in Luxemburg in 2001 and with proceedings published in Springer LNCS 2316.  
 Like the aforementioned preceding conferences, PSD 2024 originates in Europe, but wishes to stay a worldwide event in database privacy and SDC. Thus, contributions and attendees from overseas are welcome.

 Reversible computation has a growing number of promising application areas such as low power design coding/decoding, debugging, testing and verification database recovery, discrete event simulation, reversible algorithms, reversible specification formalisms reversible programming languages, process algebras, and the modeling of biochemical systems. Furthermore reversible logic provides a basis for quantum computation with its applications, for example, in cryptography and in the development of highly efficient algorithms. First reversible circuits and quantum circuits have been implemented and are seen as promising alternatives to conventional CMOS technology.  
 The conference will bring together researchers from computer science, mathematics, and physics to discuss new developments and directions for future research in Reversible Computation. This includes applications of reversibility in quantum computation. Research papers tutorials, tool demonstrations, and work-in-progress reports are within the scope of the conference. Invited talks by leading international experts will complete the program. Contributions on all areas of Reversible Computation are welcome, including---but not limited to---the following topics:  
 Applications 
  Architectures 
  Algorithms
