  Call For Papers 

 Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Research (CAIR), Chennai Institute of Technology organizes International Conference on Data Science, Agents and Artificial Intelligence 2025 in association with IEEE Madras Chapter, IEEE Computer Society Madras Section and Computer Society of India during March 28 & 29, 2025.  
 A call is made here inviting researchers and students who are involved in the research on Data Science, Agents and Artificial Intelligence. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications. Much of this important work is therefore theoretical in nature. However there is nothing as practical as a good theory, and some theories have indeed made their way into practice. Informatics applications are pervasive in many areas of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Distributed AI, including Agents and Multi-Agent Systems; this conference intends to emphasize this connection, therefore, authors are invited to highlight the benefits of Information Technology (IT) in these areas. Ideas on how to solve problems using Data Science, Agents and Artificial intelligence, both in R&D and industrial applications, are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below.

 Best papers and presentations will be recognized with special certificates and monetary prizes in the range of Rs. 5000 to Rs. 10000 for each of the nominated papers. An award committee will review and monitor the outstanding papers and presentations during the conference and recommend to CPC for a suitable prize.
