 Call for papers   
 The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN) is the leading annual forum on research at the intersection of networked embedded sensing, control, and systems design. IPSN brings together researchers from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss recent advances in both theoretical and experimental research on all aspects of networked systems of sensors and actuators. Its scope includes signal and image processing, information and coding theory, databases and information management, distributed algorithms, networks and protocols, wireless communications, collaborative objects, the Internet of Things, machine learning, mobile and social sensing, and embedded systems design. Of special interest are contributions at the confluence of multiple of these areas.  
 IPSN 2024 is co-located with the CPS-IoT Week, the premier venue for research and development of cyber-physical systems. IPSN is co-sponsored by both the ACM and IEEE, and it continues to emphasize research that bridges multiple research communities. IPSN is interested in all aspects of sensor networks, ranging from traditional topics such as networking to more recent developments such as embedded machine learning, RF sensing and computer vision.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
  
 Systems, Architectures, and Tools | Sensor data storage, retrieval, processing 
  Network and system architectures and protocols 
  IoT gateway platform architecture and services 
  Wearable systems and data processing algorithms 
  Programming models, languages, and systems 
  Programming models for IoT ensembles 
  Modeling, simulation, and measurement tools 
  Operating systems and runtime environments 
  Discovery, coordination, and use of IoT services 
  IoT reliability, adaptability, and dependability 
  Technical assessment of emerging IoT standards 
  Algorithms, Data, and Theory | Localization, synchronization, RFID, and RF sensing 
  VLC and visible light based sensing 
  Data related issues, such as methods, tools, and analysis 
  Coding, compression, and information theory 
  Theoretical foundations and fundamental bounds 
  Applications | Applications in health, wellness & sustainability 
  Applications in smart cities and urban health 
  Experiences, challenges, comparisons of platforms 
  Sensor-enabled autonomous vehicle platforms and algorithms 
  Outdoor, wide-area, or crowdsourced sensing systems 
  Sensor data processing for augmented and virtual reality applications 
  Security and Privacy | Security, trustworthiness, and privacy for IoT systems 
  Fairness, equity, and transparency issues in IoT and CPS 
  Machine Learning | Large foundational models (LFMs) for sensor data analytics, distillation of LFMs to edge platforms 
  Machine learning, deep, federated and multimodal learning on sensor data 
  Novel embedded machine learning algorithms for resource-constrained and mobile platforms 
  New hardware and system design to enable machine learning on sensor data 
   
 In addition to the established Best Paper Award, IPSN 2024 will provide a Best Research Artifact Award to the authors who have contributed the research artifact that is judged to be the most novel, easy to use, well documented, and useful to advance research. Research artifacts, such as code, data sets, and tools, are highly encouraged to be submitted or made available simultaneously with paper submission.  
 IPSN 2024 accepts double-blind paper submissions which have not been previously published. Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication and do not violate the double-blind requirement. Submitted manuscripts are up to 12 single-spaced 8.5" x 11" pages with 9-pt font size in two-column format, inclusive of figures, tables, and references, following the ACM primary article template. LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (use \documentclass[sigconf,nonacm]{acmart} option), with the default 9-pt font. Papers are to be submitted at https://ipsn2024.hotcrp.com/  . During the review process, the reviewers may anonymously communicate with the authors for clarifying questions.  
 IPSN collaborates closely with the IoTDI conference  , given the proximity in research themes (both related to IoT) and the co-location in CPS-IoT Week. We provide submission guidelines  to aid prospective authors with the conference venue selection.  
 Camera-Ready Submission Information  
 TBD Please see the instructions  for how to prepare and submit the camera-ready version.
