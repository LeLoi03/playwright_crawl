 CALL FOR PAPERS  
  23rd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS AND INTEROPERABLE SYSTEMS (DAIS 2023)  
   
  https://www.discotec.org/2023/dais  
   
  =======================================================================  
  AIM AND SCOPE  
   
  The DAIS conference series addresses all practical and conceptual aspects of  
  distributed applications, including their design, modelling, implementation  
  and operation, the supporting middleware, appropriate software engineering  
  methodologies and tools, as well as experimental studies and applications.  
  Submissions will be judged on their originality, significance, clarity,  
  relevance, and technical correctness.  
   
  The topics of interest to the conference include, but are not limited to:  
   
  Novel and innovative distributed applications and systems, particularly in the  
  areas of:  
   
  middleware,  
  cloud, edge and fog computing,  
  big data processing,  
  streaming and complex event processing,  
  distributed social networking,  
  IoT and cyber-physical systems,  
  mobile computing,  
  advanced networking (SDN/NFV),  
  micro-services and service-oriented computing,  
  serverless and FaaS computing,  
  peer-to-peer systems, and  
  data center and internet-scale systems.  
   
  Novel architectures and mechanisms, particularly in the areas of  
   
  publish/subscribe systems,  
  epidemic protocols,  
  language-based approaches,  
  virtualisation and resource allocation,  
  distributed storage,  
  trusted execution environments,  
  blockchains, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, and  
  distributed consensus mechanisms.  
   
  System issues and design goals, including  
   
  interoperability and adaptation,  
  self-* properties (e.g., self-organisation, self-management,…),  
  security and practical applications of cryptography,  
  trust and privacy,  
  cooperation incentives and fairness,  
  fault-tolerance and dependability,  
  scalability and elasticity, and  
  tail-performance and energy-efficiency.  
   
  =======================================================================  
  SUBMISSIONS  
   
  All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication  
  elsewhere. DAIS 2023 offers three submission tracks:  
   
  * Full research papers in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references.  
  * Full practical experience reports, including experimental and evaluation studies,  
  case studies, and practice reports in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references.  
  * Work-in-Progress papers, describing ongoing work and interim results, in no more  
  than 6 pages + 2 pages references.  
   
  Papers should be submitted electronically as PDF, using the Springer LNCS style  
  to the conference submission website (https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=dais2023).  
  Each paper will undergo a thorough process of peer reviews by the Program Committee.  
  Reviewing is single-blind: author name(s) should appear.  
   
  All papers accepted in any of the conference tracks will be included in the conference  
  proceedings, which will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series. Proceedings  
  will be made available at the conference. Submission implies that at least one author will  
  register and attend the conference if the paper is accepted.  
   
  =======================================================================  
  ARTEFACT SUBMISSION  
   
  To improve the reproducibility of results and to increase the visibility of prototypes and  
  tools produced by our community, authors of accepted papers (full papers, experience reports, WiP papers)  
  will be invited to submit publicly available artefacts associated with their paper for evaluation.  
  Based on the result of the evaluation, the paper may be awarded with badges. Artefact submission is optional  
  and the result of the artefact evaluation will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision. Detailed guidelines  
  for the preparation and submission of the artefacts will be made available to authors.  
   
  =======================================================================  
  IMPORTANT DATES  
   
  Abstract submission: February 11, 2023  
  Paper submission: February 18, 2023  
  Paper notification: March 31, 2023  
  Artefact submission: April 14, 2023
