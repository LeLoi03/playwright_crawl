 haisconference.eu | The 19th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2024)  combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. HAIS series of conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.

  Conference Activities 
  Hestia | Developed by ThemeIsle | Submission deadline  is approaching: 25th June 2024 | haisconference.eu | The 19th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2024)  combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. HAIS series of conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.

 haisconference.eu | The 19th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2024)  combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. HAIS series of conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.
