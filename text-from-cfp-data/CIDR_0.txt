 (all deadlines are 11:59pm Pacific Time)  August 2nd, 2024:  submission deadline for all contributions  October 4th, 2024:  author notification for all contributions  January 19-22, 2025:  conference    
  Overview  
 The annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference, complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field.  
 We invite contributions on novel approaches to data management systems, architecture, and usage including cloud based systems for data processing as well as related system issues such as data storage, networking, hardware acceleration, custom processors, memory hierarchies processor interconnects, etc. in the context of data processing. We also encourage new approaches to data management and system building based on or in support of ML/AI technologies. CIDR encourages contributions about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insights, resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based insight, and vision.  
 CIDR 2025 invites two kinds of contributions:  
 Papers (at most 6 pages). We invite both regular research papers and more visionary papers that promote interesting ideas and ongoing work. 
  Demos (a video or a description of the demo in at most 6 pages). 
  To encourage authors to submit only their best work, each person can be an author or co-author of at most one  submission of any kind   . Authors who feel their work is best captured through a demo should submit a demo proposal. Demos and papers will be interweaved in a single-tracked program.  
 Papers, and demos will be reviewed by the program committee, who will select the final program in co-operation with the organizing committee.  
 The number of participants at CIDR is limited to allow an intimate single-track experience. In the past, CIDR reached maximum capacity several weeks before the conference. As in the past, registration for the 2025 conference will be carried out in two phases. Authors who co-authored a paper or demo submission are invited to register first. Then, registration is on a first-come-first- serve basis until the conference capacity is reached.  
 Submission  
 Papers should be electronically submitted in PDF format to CMT  .  
 Similarly to previous years, conference submissions must be formatted using the double-column ACM sigconf style   (see the ACM Template  ), and must not exceed 6 pages in length including all references and appendix   . Videos can be submitted in HTML or MPEG format. Submissions will be reviewed by the program committee which will make acceptance and rejection decisions. Final versions of accepted submissions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the CIDR conference and by the VLDB Endowment. The final versions of accepted papers and demos have no page limit and can be significantly expanded from the submitted form. At least one author of an accepted paper or demo will be expected to attend the conference in person to present the paper. For accepted papers and demos with several co-authors, the program committee reserves the right to select the co-author who should present the paper at the conference as a condition of acceptance (this typically means a senior author will be chosen as the presenter).  
 Camera-Ready Guidelines  
 Camera-ready papers need to follow the formatting instructions above. Additionally, they need to include the following copyright notice at the bottom left of the first page:

 Diversity and Inclusion  
 As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) are crucial for the data management community. Please refer to D&I in DB  for the details of the coordinated D&I efforts across our community. Paper writing can make a material difference. So, we would like to strongly plead with the authors to follow the D&I writing instructions  when drafting the paper submissions.
