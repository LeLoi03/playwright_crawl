  Research 

  Research Beacons | Our Beacons illuminate areas of excellence in research and collaboration. They draw together expertise from across the spectrum of disciplines to consider complex problems, promoting a holistic and collaborative approach towards tackling grand challenges. 
  Our Beacons encompass multiple Research Institutes, Centres, and projects pertaining to particular themes. These include sustainability and climate change; health and well-being; data science and digital transformation; heritage and culture; and society and public policy. Each Beacon concentrates critical expertise and resource towards these pressing issues, driving forwards research and innovation. 
  Each Beacon's foci are diffracted into distinct research spotlights. These illuminate the unknown, casting aside shadows and revealing the detail beneath. | Light is pervasive and propagates without medium through many wavelengths, colours and frequencies. Our beacons shine a light into the world.
