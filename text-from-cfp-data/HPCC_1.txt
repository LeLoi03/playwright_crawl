 Submission Guidelines  

 Upload | your research paper in PDF format, up to 10 pages (references don’t count in the page limit). Use double-column text in a single-spaced 10-point font on 8.5×11-inch pages. IEEE strongly encourages the use of | conference manuscript templates | on its website. 
  Authors may include as many pages of appendices as they wish, but reviewers are not required to read these. If you wish to include an appendix, please add it after your references and keep in mind the double blind guidelines. 
  If any content in the Research Paper is generated using Artificial Intelligence tools, authors must transparently and thoroughly describe their use in the methods, acknowledgment, or equivalent section of the paper. Description is not necessary for tools used solely for improving spelling, grammar, and general editing. Authors are accountable for the accuracy of information provided by AI tools and for referencing any supporting work based on that information. 
  The double-blind review process applies to all submissions | ( see ISC High Performance Double-Blind Review Guidelines  ). | Please refrain from including names, affiliations, funding sources, or acknowledgments in the heading or body of the document. Authors should cite their own work in a third-party manner rather than redacting the citations. 
  Papers submitted for the Research Papers track should not have been previously published or under peer review for a different venue. Papers pre-posted to arXiv, institutional repositories, and personal websites remain eligible for submission. 
  Membership on a program committee does not inherently create a conflict of interest in submitting a paper. 

 Review Process   
        Each paper is expected to receive a minimum of 3 to 4 reviews 
  Papers will be evaluated based on novelty, fundamental insights, clarity of presentation, and potential for long-term impact 
  Reviewers will provide constructive, actionable feedback that can be used to improve the paper, whether it is eventually accepted or not 
  The Research Paper Committee reserves the right to reject incorrectly formatted papers 

  Rebuttal Phase   
        Initial reviewer comments will be made available to the authors by the committee 
  Authors can respond to clarify misunderstandings and answer questions 
  Rebuttals will be submitted in written format and will have a tight deadline 
  Authors will receive additional instructions via email 

  Final Decision   
        The paper’s track committee will consider all reviews and rebuttals 
  Live reviewer discussions will occur during the research paper committee meeting 
  A consensus-driven approach will be used to select the strongest papers 
  Notification of the papers’ outcomes will be sent to authors after the program committee’s meeting 

 Terms & Conditions  

 The research paper sessions will be held from June 10-12, 2025. 
  By submitting a research paper, you agree that one of the authors will present the work in person at ISC 2025. 
  For a paper to be included in the IEEE Xplore proceedings, at least one author must present it at the conference in person. Otherwise, the paper will be excluded from the proceedings. 
  One author is eligible for a complimentary conference participation pass. 
  Every paper presenter needs to submit a short, pre-recorded summary video of the paper before the conference. 
  Presentation slides and short videos will be available on the event platform (Swapcard) for registered attendees. 
  Travel, accommodation, registration fees for other authors, and other such expenses will not be covered by the ISC organizers. 

 Hans Meuer Award  

 Named in honor of ISC’s founding father, the winning research paper will receive a 3000 euro cash prize and an award certificate.
