 Welcome  

  (c) TODO     

 Bernhard K. Aichernig is a tenured associate professor (ao. Univ.-Prof.) at Graz University of Technology, Austria. He and his research group investigates the foundations of software engineering for realising dependable computer-based systems. Bernhard is an expert in formal methods and testing. His research covers a variety of areas combining falsification, verification and abstraction techniques. Current topics include the Internet of Things, model learning, and statistical model checking. Since 2006, he participated in four European projects. From 2004-2016 Bernhard served as a board member of Formal Methods Europe, the association that organises the Formal Methods symposia. From 2002 to 2006 he had a faculty position at the United Nations University in Macao S.A.R., China. Bernhard holds a habilitation in Practical Computer Science and Formal Methods, a doctorate, and a diploma engineer degree from Graz University of Technology.
