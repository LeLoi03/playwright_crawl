 About 
  Program 
  20th Workshop on Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs   
 Formal techniques can help analyze programs, precisely describe program behavior, and verify program properties. Languages such as Java, C#, and Scala are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their ubiquity and wide user base, stable and well-defined interfaces and platforms, and powerful (but also complex) libraries. New languages and applications in this space are continually arising, resulting in new PL research challenges.  
 Work on formal techniques and tools and on the formal underpinnings of programming languages themselves naturally complement each other. FTfJP is an established workshop which has run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people working in both fields. The workshop has a broad PL theme; the most important criterion is that submissions will generate interesting discussions within this community. Example topics of interest include:  
 Language design and semantics 
  Type systems 
  Concurrency and new application domains 
  Specification and verification of program properties 
  Program analysis (static or dynamic) 
  Security 
  Pearls (programs or proofs) 
  FTfJP welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies, experience reports, challenge proposals, and position papers. Just as the number and the feature set of Java-like languages is expanding, the term “Java-like” should be interpreted broadly.

 Call for Papers  
  
 Contributions related to formal techniques for Java-like programs are sought in two categories:  
 Full Papers.  In 6 two-column pages, the paper should present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting discussions.  
 Short Papers.  In 2 two-column pages, the paper should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to present a planned path to a PhD.  
 Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed, and will be evaluated based on their clarity and based on their potential to generate interesting discussions. The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced researchers to beginning PhD students.  
 Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library by default, though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. The use of ACM’s template for the SIGPLAN format  is required. At least one author of an accepted paper must attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -
