 Scope   
 The Fourteenth International Conference on Security and Cryptography for Networks (SCN 2024) aims to bring together researchers in the field of cryptography and information security, practitioners, developers, and users to foster cooperation, exchange techniques, tools, experiences and ideas. The conference seeks submissions from academia, government, and industry presenting novel research on all practical and theoretical aspects of cryptography and information security. The primary focus is on original, high quality, unpublished research of theoretical and practical impact, including concepts, techniques, applications and practical experiences. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings.  
 Topics   
 All topic areas related to cryptography and information security are of interest and in scope. Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:  
 Anonymity and Privacy 
  Applied Cryptography and Implementations 
  Authentication, Identification and Access Control 
  Block and Stream Ciphers 
  Complexity-Theoretic Cryptography 
  Cryptanalysis 
  Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain 
  Cryptographic Hash Functions 
  Cryptographic Protocols 
  Digital Signatures and Message Authentication Codes 
  Distributed Systems Security 
  Elliptic-Curve Cryptography 
  Formal Security Methods 
  Information-Theoretic Security 
  Post-quantum Cryptography 
  Public-Key Encryption 
  Physical Cryptography 
  Conference Proceedings   
 Conference Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  
 Submissions  
   Authors are invited to submit electronically (PDF format) a non-anonymous  extended abstract using EquinOCS: https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/SCN2024   
 We strongly encourage to typeset the extended abstract using Springer’s LNCS LaTeX package  with no changes to the style. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in the final published versions of their papers. See Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science instructions for authors  .  
 The submission should begin with a title, followed by the names, affiliations and contact information of all authors  , and a short abstract. The length of the submission should be at most 20 pages, including bibliography but excluding clearly marked appendices. Within these 20 pages, the submission should clearly indicate the results achieved, their significance, and their relation to other work in the area. Referees are not required to read appendices; the paper should be intelligible without them. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that was published elsewhere, or work that any of the authors has submitted in parallel to a journal or to any other conference or workshop with proceedings.  
 Reviewers assignment will follow IACR Policy on Conflict of Interests  .  
 Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees.  
 Presentation   
 Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference.
