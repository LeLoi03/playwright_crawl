 About 
  Call for Workshops

 Call for Workshops  
   
 ECOOP host a diverse offering of workshops bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experiences.  
 Topics for workshops may include, but are not limited to the theory, design, implementation, optimization, testing, and analysis of programs and programming languages. Workshops will run after the program of the main conference (Thu. 3 - Fri. 4 July 2025). The organizers will investigate the possibility of organizing the publication of a single-volume peer-reviewed post-proceedings if there is enough interest.  
 To submit a proposal for an ECOOP’25 workshop, please complete the online form below. After submitting, you will receive an automated email confirmation of your submission and, within at most four weeks (or shortly after the final submission deadline), a formal response notifying you if the workshop has been accepted for ECOOP’25.  
 Submission link: https://framaforms.org/proposal-for-ecoop25-workshop-1729617158  .  
 Please contact ECOOP’25 workshops chair, Clément Aubert ( caubert@augusta.edu  ), if you have any questions.
