 General Information     
   
 ADBIS conferences provide an international platform for the presentation of research on database theory, development of advanced DBMS technologies, solutions for data engineering and analytics, and their advanced applications. The main objective of the ADBIS series of conferences is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote interaction and collaboration among the database, information systems, data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning communities from European countries and the rest of the world. ADBIS 2024 will consist of regular sessions with technical contributions reviewed and selected by an international program committee, as well as of invited keynote and tutorial talks presented by leading scientists.  
 For the second consecutive time in the ADBIS series, ADBIS 2024 considers a shepherding phase to help authors of borderline papers improve their papers.  

 Topics     
   
 We invite the submission of original research contributions addressing core data management tasks, as well as techniques and technologies in the following broad areas of data management:  
 Database Management Systems 
  Information Systems Architectures and Data Services 
  Management and Mining of Heterogeneous Data Types 
  Big Data Management and Analytics 
  Scalable Data Science 
  Responsible Data Science 

 Important Dates     
   
 Abstract submission deadline: | April 15, 2024 | May 10, 2024 
  Paper submission deadline: | April 20, 2024 | May 10 | , 2024 
  Notification of acceptance/shepherding: | June 10, 2024 
  Camera-ready papers/end of shepherding: | July 03, 2024 

 Paper Submission, Publishing, and Awards     
   
 The organizers of ADBIS 2024 invite original papers (not submitted elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to the aforementioned list of topics. Both short and long paper submissions are accepted.  
 LONG papers can be:  
 Regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, data structures, and system architectures for the management of data; 
  Experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the algorithm/system/method being assessed. 
  SHORT papers can be:  
 Early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and discussion of early research results, that include early experimental findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the difficulties being faced towards full fruition; 
  Vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for data management in important areas related to the scope of the conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant. 

 Submission Guidelines and Instructions     
   
 The page limits are as follows:  
 LONG (research or experimental) papers: 14 LNCS style pages; 
  SHORT (early findings or visionary) papers: up to 10 LNCS style pages. 
  Papers should be submitted in PDF format using the EasyChair  online submission system.  
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines  and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.  
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection.  

 Shepherding     
   
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection. The shepherding process will involve: authors will be given a list of issues/improvements that have to be addressed within 2 weeks’ time; authors improve the paper addressing these concerns; authors submit the revised paper in camera-ready format; the PC chairs ultimately decide whether the revised paper is acceptable as is or not to the final program.  
  
 The schedule for shepherding is as follows:  
 Notification of shepherding status: | June 10, 2024 
  Authors submit revised, camera-ready version: | June 25, 2024 
  Notification of acceptance for shepherded papers: | June 30, 2024 
  Camera-ready documents and copyright: | July 05, 2024 

 Awards     
   
 ADBIS 2024 will award the Best Conference Paper Award and the Best Doctoral Symposium Paper Award, each receiving a 500 EUR prize sponsored by Springer.  

 Special Issue     
   
 The best papers of the conference will be invited to special issues in top tier journals (TBA), to be organized after the conference.  

 Diversity and Inclusion     
   
 GRANTS. In line with previous editions, and to foster a broad inclusion, the conference will provide two participation grants (registration waiving) for two students from East European Countries. To the extent possible, every effort will be made to potentially increase this number.  
 D&I INITIATIVE. The ADBIS community believes that diversity and culture of support encourage retention and attraction of talent, promote diversity of thought and perspective, and help make the scientific community more flexible and responsive in times of change. For these reasons, ADBIS 2024 continues to participate in the Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) initiative of the Database community aiming to guide researchers in our community to adopt a more inclusive mindset in general toward different individuals regardless of their age, gender, gender identity, race, cultural background, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, parental and marital status, etc. If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or complaints, please email the ADBIS 2024 Diversity and Inclusion chairs.
