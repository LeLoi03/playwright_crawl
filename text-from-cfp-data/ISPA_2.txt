 The 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications (IEEE ISPA 2024) is a forum for presenting leading work on parallel and distributed computing and networking, including architecture, compilers, runtime systems, applications, reliability, security, parallel programming models and much more. During the symposium, scientists and engineers in both academia and industry are invited to present their work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multithreaded, heterogeneous, clustered systems, distributed systems, grids, clouds, edge, and large scale machines). 

 ISPA 2024 topics include but are not limited to the following:     
 Track 1: Systems and Architectures 
  Track 2: Technologies and Tools 
  – Cloud computing and data center technology 
  – Parallel and distributed algorithms 
  – Migration of computations 
  – Novel parallel programming paradigms 
  – Multi-clouds environments, cloud federation, interoperability 
  – Programming models for cloud services 
  – Code generation and optimization 
  – Energy management and green computing 
  – Compilers for parallel computers 
  – Wireless and mobile networks 
  – Middleware and tools 
  – Systems and Architectures for artificial intelligence 
  – Scheduling and resource management 
  – Distributed/parallel algorithms and application 
  – Reliability, fault tolerance, and dependability 
  – Social networks, crowdsourcing, and P2P systems 
   Track 3: Applications and Services 
  Track 4: Security and Block-chain 
  – High-performance scientific and engineering computing 
  – Blockchain-based applications and services 
  – Blockchain security and privacy 
  – Grid and cluster computing 
  – Security of NFT 
  – Pervasive and ubiquitous computing 
  – Blockchain in cyber physical systems 
  – Databases, data mining, and data management 
  – Distributed database technology 
  – Big data and business analytics 
  – Scalability issues in blockchain 
  – Scientific cloud systems and services 
  – Blockchain in edge and cloud computing 
  – Internet computing and web services 
  – Blockchain-based applications and services 
  – Software Defined Network and its applications 

 Paper Submission   All papers need to be submitted electronically through the conterence submission website (EDAS) in PDF format at https://edas.info/N32470  . Each paper is limited to 8 pages (or 10 pages with over-length charge) for a regular full paper, 6 pages (or 8 pages with over-length charge) for a full paper including figures and references using the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings manuscripts style (two columns, single-spaced, font size 10). Pages must be US letter size (8.5 by 11 inches) or A4 size (210 x 297 mm). The PDF issues generate warnings: obsolete type-3 fonts. These PDF issues prevent upload: fonts not embedded, scanned image, conversion to text failedand encrypted file. 

 Paper Publication   Papers accepted by ISPA 2024 conference will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. All accepted papers will be submitted to IEEE Xplore and EI. Distinguished papers presented at the conference, after further revision, will be invited for submission to a special issue.
