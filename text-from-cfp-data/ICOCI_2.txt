 About  ICOCI 2023  
 Life today has changed drastically as a result of Covid-19. Many aspects of life have shifted from the traditional ways to automation using electronic and communication devices. Digitalization is the main keyword emphasized everywhere to keep society resilient and adaptive to disasters. As a result, a digital society emerges, in which people use information and communication technology at home, work, school, and socialize to keep going with the businesses and life.  
 Back in 2009, United Nations promoted “inclusive society”, which was defined by the Expert Group Meeting on Promoting Social Integration, Helsinki (July 2008) as:  
 “ … a society that over-rides differences of race, gender, class, generation, and geography, and ensures inclusion, equality of opportunity as well as capability of all members of the society to determine an agreed set of social institutions that govern social interaction.”   
 As the digital society emerges, the term is extended to the society’s current values and behaviours. Therefore, the United Nations of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and The Pacific ( ESCAP  ) promotes an “inclusive digital society” focusing on making the society e-resilient in recovering from the disaster.  
 From the aspect of computing and informatics, a question arises: What are the features of technology that would enable an inclusive digital society? Specifically, how the major computing fields of study like artificial intelligence, IoT, and cybersecurity would assist in achieving an “inclusive digital society”? Therefore, ICOCI 2023 would like to invite you to discuss this topic and share your thoughts and works. Together, we could nurture an inclusive digital society for the sustainability of our nation and the universe.  
 School of Computing (SOC)  , Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) organises the 9th International Conference on Computing and Informatics 2023 (ICOCI 2023) from 13 to 14 September 2023. ICOCI has continuously been the platform for researchers and practitioners to share the finding of their studies since 2006. The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth events were held in 2006, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021.
