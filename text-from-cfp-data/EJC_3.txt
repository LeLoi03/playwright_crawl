 Abstract :  Information System Engineering has made the assumption that an Information System is supposed to capture some excerpt of the real world history and hence has concentrated on modeling. This has caused the introduction of a large variety of models and especially conceptual models by which an information system can be modelled in high level conceptual terms. By contrast, very little attention has been paid to the conceptual modeling process which has the purpose of investigating the requirements of the users community and abstracting from that the conceptual specification of the information system. This results in a low level of support provided to requirements engineers. However, the emphasis on system modeling is shifting to process modeling. The need for process modeling motivates the process stream of the NATURE Esprit project. The Requirements Engineering Process model developed within this project is the main topic of this paper. The particular RE process modeling approach chosen in NATURE emphasises the notion of decision within the context in which it is taken. The paper outlines the modeling approach. It details and exemplifies the main concepts proposed to model the RE process and their relationships. Finally, it sketches the advantages of the process model by introducing its different usages.

 An approach for defining ways-of-working  
   Colette Rolland ,  Carine Souveyet ,  Mario Moreno  +2 more   University of Paris   -  01 Jan 1995   
   
 Show Less      
      
  TL;DR:  In this article, the authors propose a meta-modeling approach for defining ways-of-working in a systemtic manner, where a given way of working is constructed by instantiation of a process meta-model allowing to deal with a large variety of situations in a flexible, decision-oriented manner.

  TL;DR:  In this article, the authors propose a new approach to software development which explicitly avoids the use of a single representation scheme or common schema, instead, multiple ViewPoints are utilised to partition the domain information, the development method and the formal representations used to express software specifications.
