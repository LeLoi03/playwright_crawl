 The 21 st  Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025)   
 Tuscany (Lucca), Italy   
 June 9 to 11, 2025   
 * The DCOSS-IoT series of events are always technically co-sponsored by IEEE, and Proceedings are published by IEEE Xplore.  
 The 21 st  International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025) will be held in Tuscany (Lucca), Italy. The conference is always co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and by the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP).  
 The conference was previously known as DCOSS. Starting in 2023, the event is broadening its scope beyond sensor networks to include smart systems in general and the Internet of Things (IoT). The updated name is “Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things” (DCOSS-IoT).   
 In the last few years, we have witnessed significant growth in the use of IoT and distributed sensor systems in several application areas, including smart transportation, smart energy systems, smart homes and buildings, smart healthcare, and environmental monitoring. For smart sensor systems to truly become useful and pervasive, we need to address several research challenges, including the tight integration of sensing and machine intelligence, reliable and efficient networking, interoperability and scalability, the need for dependable autonomy, interaction with humans, and important aspects of security, privacy and trust. DCOSS-IoT focuses on issues arising in the entire IoT and networked sensor systems stack, covering aspects of high-level abstractions, models and languages, communication technologies, novel algorithms and applications, system design approaches and architectures, and tools for simulated and real deployments. Potential authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating recent advances in theoretical and experimental research.  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:   
 Artificial Intelligence for IoT 
  Machine learning and data mining for IoT and Smart Systems 
  Smart healthcare to combat epidemics 
  Edge and fog computing: distributed computing models from sensor to cloud 
  Machine intelligence in distributed sensor systems and real-time analytics 
  Novel communication paradigms (e.g., 5G/6G, VLC, DSA) for IoT and Smart Systems 
  Cyber-Physical Systems 
  IoT and Smart Systems for Smart and Connected Communities 
  Autonomous systems: closing the loop between sensing and actuation 
  Time and location management 
  Robustness, resilience, and dependability of IoT and smart systems 
  Security and privacy in IoT and Smart Systems 
  Performance analysis: complexity, correctness, scalability 
  Mobile and human-centric sensing 
  IoT and Smart Systems for social computing 
  Interoperability, heterogeneity and scalability 
  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based sensing/communications/networking 
  Social sensing and crowd sensing techniques, applications, and systems 
  Complex systems comprising wearable, robotic and/or fixed sensor systems 
  IoT and Smart Systems for emerging and developing economies 
  Green and environmentally friendly IoT (low power, harvesting, energy management) 
  Sensors and Robots for Internet of Intelligent Things 
  Design and implementation of real-world applications and systems 
  Approaches, tools, and experience of deployment and operation 
  Interdisciplinary applications of IoT and Smart Systems 
  Smart healthcare and digital epidemiology 
  Smart agriculture 
  Smart infrastructures 
  Smart cities 
  Smart energy, transportation, and water distribution systems 
  Smart factories 
  Smart workspace 
  Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating current research on distributed smart systems and IoT related to the aforementioned topics  of interest. Please use the US letter size (8.5 X 11 in) standard IEEE conference LaTeX format or Microsoft Word template available on: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html  .  
 All submissions should be written in English and have a maximum of eight (8) printed pages, including figures and references. Two (2) additional pages at 100$/page for supplementary material only (such as theorems, proofs, implementation details) are allowed. Starting 2023, DCOSS-IoT follows a double-blind review process. As a result, authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, the existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the EDAS submission system.  
 *** Special Issue and Best Paper Awards ***   
 DCOSS-IoT 2025 will announce a best paper award and a best poster/demo award.  
 Extended versions of selected best papers from DCOSS-IoT 2025 will be included in a Special Issue of the Computer Networks (COMNET) Journal.
