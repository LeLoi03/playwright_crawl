 Open Call Regional Representatives Latin America 2024/2025    
  
 Dear IFSA World,   
 IFSA wishes to announce the open call for the position of Regional Representatives for Latin America. This is a call for enthusiastic and self-motivated individuals who will serve for the term 2024/2025 starting from September till August.   
 Introduction   
 IFSA Officials volunteer to contribute to the IFSA Network. This can take many forms: from being the FAO representative for IFSA members, to exploring your creative side in designing for social media, to connecting with the Local Committees in your region and helping them engage in international IFSA activities and cross-national meetings. Whether you are interested in communication, capacity development, or policy, IFSA offers a wide range of opportunities.   
  
 Depending on the position you take on, you will spend anywhere from a few hours to several hours per week on your tasks. You will not do this alone, IFSA has around 50 Officials who communicate in an online network consisting of Officials, alumni, consulting members, etc. You will frequently attend or organize online meetings related to your fellow Officials’ work or to annual events like the International Forestry Students’ Symposium (IFSS) or Interim taking place halfway through every IFSA term. There is always someone to share your volunteering experience with or to simply chat about the forestry world!

  Ensure that LC information is updated in the membership database 
  Support the organization of the Regional Meeting 
  Get in touch with inactive LCs and try to reactivate them 
  Help with the application process for new LCs 
  Workload   
 Approximately 5 hours per week 
  Try to check your inbox every single day and reply to any needs, which need your attention as soon as possible.

 Requirements   
 In order to apply to an official position you MUST comply with those requirements:   
 You need to be a member of an IFSA Local Committee and either be an active student or have graduated no longer than one year ago. 
  Proficiency in English, as it is the official language of IFSA and therefore the only means of communication between Officials.

  Access to a Computer or tablet. 
  Motivation letter   
 The motivation letter should cover all the following points and be no longer than 800 words. Note that these points correspond to the criteria that are used to evaluate the motivation letter.

 If the video is longer than 2 minutes, just shorten it talking about the key points from your letter; the other points are covered by the letter; 
  Ensure good lighting 
  Make sure the sound is clear and has good volume so the video is easy to understand (no background noise/music)
