 About this event  
   
 Event lasts 8 hours 30 minutes 
  Welcome to AUT Paramedicine Research Day 2025!    
 Date:   Friday 14th March 2025  
 Location:   AUT South Campus  
 The theme of AUT's Paramedicine Research Day 2025 is " Innovations and Future Directions in Paramedicine   ".  
 Come join us for a day filled with exciting research presentations, discussions,   and networking opportunities   in the field of paramedicine   . Meet fellow researchers, practitioners, and students passionate about advancing paramedic care   . Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting your journey, this event is a great chance to learn, share ideas,   and collaborate   with like-minded individuals. Don't miss out! Anyone is welcome to attend the event.  
 We are very excited to announce that our international Keynote Speaker for 2025 is the renowned Dr. Sheldon Cheskes   , who is flying all the way in from Toronto, Canada to join us in person. A leading figure in resuscitation science with over 150 publications in journals including the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Cheskes has made groundbreaking contributions to the field, particularly with his pioneering research on Double Sequential Defibrillation (DSD). His work, including the landmark DOSE VF study, has revolutionised our understanding and treatment of refractory ventricular fibrillation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrests here in Aotearoa New Zealand. This is a unique opportunity for you to learn directly from a trailblazer whose research is shaping the future of emergency medical care. Don’t miss this chance to enhance your skills and knowledge and be inspired by Dr. Cheskes’ passion and expertise. We hope to see you there.  
 As well as Dr Cheskes, we will have presentations from new and emerging   leading researchers   , free food and refreshments   , and the event will contribute to your CPD hours   . The first 50 registrants will also be offered free parking on AUT South Campus.
