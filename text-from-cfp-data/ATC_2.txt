 The International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications is an annual conference series, since 2008, co-organized by the Radio & Electronics Association of Vietnam (REV) and the IEEE Communications Society (IEEE ComSoc). The goal of the series is twofold: to foster an international forum for scientific and technological exchange among Vietnamese and worldwide scientists and engineers in the fields of electronics, communications and related areas, and to gather their high-quality research contributions.  
 In 2024, the ATC conference will be held in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam during October 17-19 and hosted by Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology. The conference will feature prominent invited speakers as well as papers by top researchers from all over the world.

  SUBMISSION AND POLICIES   
 Submitted papers (for both regular and special sessions) are subject to a blind review process handled by an international technical program committee. An author of an accepted paper must register at full rate (member or non-member of the IEEE or REV) prior to uploading the camera-ready version. The maximum length of the camera-ready version is 6 pages. Conference proceedings that meet IEEE quality reviews standards may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. The IEEE reverses the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g, removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.
