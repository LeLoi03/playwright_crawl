 Call for Papers  

 2025 IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2025) will take place in Atlanta, USA on May 19-23, 2025.  
 Being the flagship conference of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, ICRA will bring together the world’s top researchers and leading companies to share ideas and advances in Robotics and Automation. The conference will include plenary sessions, contributed paper sessions, workshops and tutorial sessions, forums, exhibitions, and robot competitions.  

 Paper Submission: Deadline: 16 September 2024 (23:59 PST)   
 Papers to ICRA 2025 can be submitted on the PaperPlaza Portal  . The page limit is 6 pages for the paper (text, figures, tables, acknowledgement, etc.) + any number of pages for the bibliography/references. Papers exceeding the (6+n) page limit at the time of submission will be returned without review.

 We strongly encourage authors to submit a video clip to complement the paper submission. Please note that a video that was NOT submitted with the initial submission of an ICRA paper (during the two submission windows), will NOT be accepted at a later date.  
 Video uploads will be unavailable  between 10 September and 16 September 2024, to allow the unhindered uploading/updating of the PDF manuscripts of contributed papers during that period.

 Presentation of RA-L, T-ASE, T-RO and RAM papers  

 All published papers from RAM and non-evolutionary published RA-L, T-ASE and T-RO papers are eligible for presentation at ICRA, during an eligibility time window. Authors are automatically offered the option to present their paper at one of these conferences upon notification of final acceptance. Please, check the webpage of the journals for information on eligibility time window:  RA-L  , RAM  ,  T-ASE   and T-RO  .   

 Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Authors  

 Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to ICRA 2025. The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content. The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy.  

 Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Reviewers  

 Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under review shall not be processed through an AI system. Doing so is considered a breach of confidentiality and as such is not permitted.  

 Note for authors who require a CC BY open access license  

 Please note that some authors (such as those funded by UKRI) require a “Creative Commons Attribution Only License – Open Access” (CC BY) s license for their papers. If you require a CC BY license for your paper, please follow the guidelines described under option 2 on the following website: https://open.ieee.org/ieee-compliance-with-ukri/   

 FAQ  

 What is this year’s motto? Which topic areas are covered by the conference?   
          Traditionally, ICRA covers all areas of robotics research. In order to find out if your paper will fit to the conference, you may want to check the ICRA keywords. You can find the complete list of ICRA keywords here: Keywords – IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (ieee-ras.org)   
 When you submit a paper, you should select at least three keywords from this list.  

  Is the ICRA review process single-blind or double-blind?   
          The ICRA review process is single-blind (reviewers stay anonymous, but author information is visible). Therefore, manuscripts should include all authors and their affiliations. Additionally, please identify and include the email address of the corresponding author.  
 You can find templates here: Important Information for Manuscript Preparation (papercept.net)   

  Can I add supplementary material in the paper or as an attachment?   
          The allowed paper length is 6+N, meaning 6 pages for the paper content, plus any number of pages for the references. Any supplementary material must fit within the 6 regular pages. A video attachment is possible.  
 You can find more details on the paper format here: https://2025.ieee-icra.org/announcements/paper-submissions/   

  Will there be an extension to the paper submission deadline?   
          There is no plan to extend the paper submission deadline.   

  Can I add weblinks in the paper?   
          You can include URLs (not links embedded in the pdf), but you should not expect that reviewers will look at those links, or that they will influence the review process. Beyond the submitted paper and the (optional) supplementary video, reviewers are not required to look at any other material when writing their reviews.  
 Please find more information of the PDF requirements on Compliance (papercept.net)  .  

  Is it allowed to submit a paper that previously was published at a workshop or on a preprint server (e.g. arxiv)?   
          IEEE supports the evolutionary publication paradigm of workshop papers being improved to conference papers, which are then improved to journal papers. Therefore, papers, which previously have been published at a workshop without formal/peer reviewed proceedings, can be submitted to ICRA. Similarly, papers, which have been uploaded on a preprint server (e.g. arxiv) and are not submitted simultaneously to any other conference or journal, can be submitted to ICRA.  
 However, if your workshop paper has a DOI, this would be considered as an archival publication equivalent to a conference paper. Such papers cannot be submitted.  

  How can I transfer an accepted paper from T-ASE/T-FR/RA-P for presentation at ICRA?   
          If you want to transfer an accepted paper from one of the journals T-ASE, T-FR, or RA-P to ICRA, the paper should be submitted in paperplaza in the relevant submission category of ICRA. Do not submit it as a regular ICRA paper! For the paper upload, you will need to enter a code, which can be obtained from the Editor-In-Chief of the journal.  
 Notice that papers from T-RO, RA-M, and RA-L follow a different process and do not require a code. Authors of accepted papers will receive an email from PaperCept regarding the transfer of their paper to a conference at which they wish to present their paper.
