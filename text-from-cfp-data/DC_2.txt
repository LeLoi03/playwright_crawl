 Research Symposia Series

 Aims and Objectives of ASIS&T Research Symposium Series   
 ASIS&T Research Symposia are research-oriented events that address current, important and emerging topics of interest to the ASIS&T community. Symposia are held independently of the ASIS&T Annual Meetings and may be designed to catalyze and develop new research directions, to build upon existing areas of research, or to facilitate collaboration and knowledge translation with industry and professional practice.  
 Research Symposia are intended to gather a limited number of researchers and/or professionals from diverse backgrounds, fields and career stages to discuss research focused on a specified theme or problem. Symposia should promote active engagement and exchanges between participants. Symposia should be aimed at both ASIS&T members and non-members, with a view of growing ASIS&T’s membership.  
 Symposia can be virtual, held on Zoom, in person, or hybrid. Carefully consider the most appropriate format for your symposium. As hybrid events can be difficult to run smoothly, both technically and logistically, we recommend proposing a symposium that is either entirely in person or virtual. If you opt for hybrid, ensure you have appropriate working technical infrastructure (e.g. whole-room camera and microphone setup, projector for Zoom). Also consider how you will ensure equity across in-person and virtual attendees.  
 Resources   
 ASIS&T will support Research Symposia in a variety of ways (support-in-kind), including setting up registration, promoting the event through various channels (e.g. through chapters), running the Zoom (if entirely virtual), etc.  

 Submit a Proposal for a Symposium   
 Proposals should be submitted to the Chair of the ASIS&T Research Engagement Committee (REC), John Budd  by July 15, 2024 (11.59pm EDT). If you would like to receive formative feedback on your proposal from REC, submit a draft (also by email) by June 14, 2024 (11.59pm EDT). Submitting a draft for formative feedback is not mandatory. We will send decision notifications in early August.  

 Instructions on Submitting a Proposal
