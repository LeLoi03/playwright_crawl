 Call for Papers (Closed)  
 Conceptual Modeling, AI, and Beyond  
 As AI and ML reshape technology, they're also revolutionizing conceptual modeling. We call for papers exploring this change, particularly how AI and ML integrate with and expand conceptual modeling. Submissions should cover established topics like modeling languages, theories, and methods, as well as AI/ML's novel contributions to the field. We encourage papers that push the boundaries of conceptual modeling and demonstrate AI/ML's transformative effects. Contributions should reflect the current state and forecast the future of conceptual modeling, setting the stage for pioneering research. We also invite industry reports, vision papers, and additional “hackathon” papers.  

 Important Dates

 Submission Guidelines  
 Submit papers via EasyChair for ER 2024  to the “ER 2024 Full Papers” track.  
 Since the proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series, authors must submit manuscripts using the LNCS  style or Overleaf  . The page limit is 16 pages (excluding references). Papers will be judged on contribution, literature basis, novelty, clarity, relevance, and rigor. Other types of submissions include: workshops, posters, forum papers, project exhibitions, and hackathon proposals. The review process is double-blind. Submissions must be anonymized.  

 Post-Conference Special Journal Issue  
 The authors of selected papers will be invited to prepare a substantially revised and extended version to a special issue in Elsevier’s Data & Knowledge Engineering  .
