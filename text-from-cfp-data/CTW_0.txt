 The Cologne-Twente Workshop on Graphs and Combinatorial Optimization 2023 welcomes contributions on theory and applications of discrete  
  algorithms, graphs and combinatorial optimization in the wider sense.  
 The series of Cologne-Twente Workshops on Graphs and Combinatorial Optimization started with meetings organized every two years by the universities of Cologne and Twente. The organizational base was later expanded by other universities. Since 2003 the workshop is held (almost) every year.
