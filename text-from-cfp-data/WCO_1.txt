 Call For Papers 
 The 16th Workshop on Computational Optimization, Modelling and Simulation (COMS 2025)  
  7-9 July 2025, Singapore https://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2025/  
  [Workshop Organizers: Xin-She Yang, Slawomir Koziel, Leifur Leifsson]  
   
  The 16th workshop "Computational Optimization, Modelling and Simulation (COMS 2025)" will be a part of the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2025) and Workshops on Computational Science (WCS 2025). This will be the 16th event of the COMS workshop series with the first held during ICCS 2010 in Amsterdam, then within ICCS in Singapore, USA, Spain, Australia, Iceland, USA, Switzerland, China, Portugal, Netherlands, Poland, UK, Czech and Spain. COMS 2025 intends to provide a forum and foster discussion on the cross-disciplinary research and development in computational optimization, computer modelling and simulation. Accepted papers will be published in Springer's LNCS Series.  
   
  COMS2025 will focus on new algorithms and methods, new trends, and latest developments in computational optimization, modelling and simulation as well as applications in science, engineering and industry.  
   
  Topics include (but not limited to):  
  · Computational optimization, engineering optimization and design  
  · Bio-inspired computing and algorithms  
  · Metaheuristics (ant and bee algorithms, cuckoo search, firefly algorithm, genetic algorithms, PSO, simulated annealing etc)  
  · Simulation-driven design and optimization of computationally expensive objectives  
  · Surrogate- and knowledge-based optimization algorithms  
  · Scheduling and network optimization  
  · Integrated approach to optimization and simulation  
  · Multiobjective optimization  
  · New optimization algorithms, modelling techniques related to optimization  
  · Design of experiments  
  · Application case studies in engineering and industry.
