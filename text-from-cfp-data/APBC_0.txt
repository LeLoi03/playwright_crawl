Systems biology integrates computational and experimental approaches to study biological systems holistically.   DRUG DISCOVERY AND REPURPOSING:   Computational methods are extensively used in virtual screening, molecular docking, and drug-target interaction prediction. These approaches accelerate drug discovery and enable the repurposing of existing drugs for new therapeutic applications.   ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES(ELSI):   With the increasing volume of biological data being generated, there is a growing emphasis on addressing ethical concerns, ensuring data privacy, and developing frameworks for responsible data sharing and usage in computational biology research.   BIOINFORMATICS EDUCATION:   Bioinformatics education is fast advancing by reflecting substantial changes in the expanding research areas and educational tools.   OMICS-Based INFORMATICS:   Various informatics resources and technologies have been developed for omics data accumulated via high-throughput technologies.   DATABASES, ONTOLOGIES AND BIOCURATION:   To effectively manage the vast amounts of biological data generated by advanced measurement techniques, it is increasingly crucial to design interoperable and reusable biological databases, construct ontologies for precise data representation in life sciences, and refine biocuration workflows to enhance data quality and accessibility.   EVOLUTIONARY, COMPARATIVE GENOMICS AND PHYLOGENETICS:   New discoveries as well as groundbreaking methods are being made for comparing genomic data and revealing the evolutionary histories and relationships of diverse species.   SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY AND ENGINEERING:   Engineering biology enabling the intentional design, manufacture and deployment of living cells, cell systems, and other biological processes to create materials and products for benefiting humanity.   GENERAL COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY:   Other topics related to computational biology not listed above.   OTHERS:   Other topics not listed above   Guidelines for Multiple talks   
 To ensure diverse content and maximize participation, the same oral presentation is not permitted to be delivered more than once at APBJC 2024. However, research may be presented in both oral and poster formats. While having the same individual present two (or more) distinct talks is allowed, it is not encouraged. Furthermore, while a presenting author is welcome to present more than one poster, these should not be posters which are scheduled in the same poster session. We strongly encourage labs to engage multiple lab members to foster a collaborative and comprehensive representation of their research efforts.
