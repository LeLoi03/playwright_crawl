  The 21st International Conference on Managed Programming Languages and Runtimes (MPLR 2024, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems around, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Papers accepted by MPLR 2024 describe original research results and have not been published anywhere else. Each submitted paper has received a minimum of three reviews by members of the program committee. Papers have been selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the MPLR 2024 symposium and present the paper.  
 We are thrilled to announce our distinguished keynote speaker  for MPLR 2024:  
 Dr. Ben Titzer  from Carnegie Mellon University will be talking about:  
 Can WebAssembly Be Software’s Final Substrate?  
 Since the dawn of computing, many formats for executable programs have come and gone. The design of an executable format encounters design choices and tradeoffs such as expressiveness, ease of parsing/decoding/execution, the level of abstraction, and performance. With the advent of WebAssembly, a portable low-level compilation target for many languages, an intriguing question arises: can we finally standardize a universal binary format and software virtual machine? After many years, I believe that we finally can. Unlike language-specific bytecode formats whose abstraction level serves only one language family well, or machine-code formats that serve specific ISAs and operating systems well, WebAssembly sits between these levels of abstraction. In this talk I will share my vision for a future where all software sits on a standardized, well-specified, formally-verified substrate that allows innovation above and below, and unlocks high performance and portability for all programming languages.

 Call for Papers  
  
 The 21st International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).  
 Topics   
 The areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Languages and Compilers | Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …) 
  Domain-specific languages 
  Language design 
  Compilers and interpreters 
  Type systems and program logics 
  Language interoperability 
  Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency 
  Virtual Machines | Portable intermediate representations (e.g., JVM, WebAssembly, RPython, …) 
  Managed runtime systems (e.g., GraalVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, JavaScriptCore, .NET, …) 
  VM design and optimization 
  VMs for mobile and embedded devices 
  VMs for real-time applications 
  Memory management and garbage collection 
  Hardware/software co-design 
  Persistence 
  Techniques, Tools, and Applications | Static and dynamic program analysis 
  Testing and debugging 
  Refactoring 
  Program understanding 
  Program synthesis 
  Security and privacy 
  Performance analysis and monitoring 
  Compiler and program verification and model checking 
  If you are unsure whether a particular topic falls within the scope of MPLR’24 or if you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Program Chair Christoph Kirsch at ck@cs.uni-salzburg.at   
 Submission Categories   
 MPLR accepts four types of submissions:  
 Regular research papers | , describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Work-in-progress research papers | , describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix); 
  Industry and tool papers | , presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content); 
  Posters and demonstrations | , which will be evaluated similarly to work-in-progress papers. (Format: poster pdf and 1-page abstract). 
  Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.  
 MPLR 2024 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication   
 Author Instructions   
 Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan  style.  
 If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the acmart  document class with the sigplan  option ( not  the sigconf  option). In the acmart-primary.zip  file that downloads from the LaTeX (Version 1.90) link on the https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  page, look for samples/sample-sigplan.tex  as a guide. If you use Overleaf, be sure to change the documentclass  option manuscript  to sigplan  . For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX command \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  . Please use the standard setting, e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format uses two columns for the test.  
 All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing  . Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person.  We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Submission Site: https://mplr24.hotcrp.com

 Call for Posters and Demos  
  
 Posters  are an excellent opportunity for researchers to submit novel ideas with preliminary results within the topics of the conference. Posters can also accompany a paper submission as a way to provide additional demonstration and discussion opportunities. They will be evaluated similarly to work-in-progress papers. The text should contain sufficient technical details of the work such that the committee can assess its relevance.  
 Submission format  : one-page poster draft accompanied by an abstract of maximum two pages (excluding references).  
 Demonstrations  allow authors to showcase their work in an interactive way. Demo submissions may include (but are not limited to) demonstrations of research prototypes, tool tutorials, live coding sessions, and demonstrations of (industrial or academic) applications. Authors of demos should submit a one-page abstract describing the tool/technology they have created and why it is relevant for the conference. In an additional page, the authors should indicated the intended duration of the demo and describe what participants of the demonstration will be able to see or do with the prototype. During the demonstration authors are expected to discuss scientific and technical aspects of the prototype and should not push any commercial agenda.  
 Submission format  : abstract and additional information of maximum one page each (excluding references). Optionally, a link to a video/media file can be submitted to support the submission.  
 The abstracts will not appear as part of the conference proceedings (because the camera-ready deadline is too early for that), but if at submission time you mark whether you would like to have the abstract appear online, we will put it online. You may want to use the ACM SIGPLAN format like the regular submissions.
