  Rossano Venturini | QuickScorer: A Fast Algorithm to Rank Documents with Additive Ensembles of Regression Trees   
  For a paper that develops a novel representation of binary regression trees based on bitvectors and an algorithm to perform a fast interleaved traversal of the trees in a cache-aware fashion, and demonstrates significant efficiency gains on publically available learning-to-rank data sets with various models that use ensembles of regression trees. 
 2014 | Giuseppe Ottaviano  
  Rossano Venturini | Partitioned Elias-Fano indexes   
  For a paper that significantly improves on an already excellent compression technique, while preserving query time efficiency, as well as exhibiting the best compression ratio/processing speed trade-off. 
 2013 | Ryen W. White | Beliefs and Biases in Web Search   
  For a paper which explores the impact of pre-conceived biases when searching in the health domain using a combination of surveys, human labeling of search results, and large scale search log analysis. 
 2012 | Mark Smucker  
  Charles Clarke | Time-based calibration of effectiveness measures   
  Selected for proposing a novel evaluation framework for IR where cumulative gain is computed with consideration of the time spent by users on examining search results, which enables better modeling of user effort in quantitative IR evaluation.
