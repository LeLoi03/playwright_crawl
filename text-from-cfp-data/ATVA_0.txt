 Call for Proposals  
  
 Host ATVA 2025  
 We are soliciting proposals in advance for hosting the conference. The Steering Committee of the ATVA will review all submitted proposals, and select a set of proposals to be considered and voted . Those submitting nominations will be expected to attend this meeting and make a short presentation concerning the location they are nominating.  
 Proposals for hosting should include a list of potential program committee members. They do not require formal budgets, but are expected to include information about potential costs. Also, information concerning potential meeting spaces, hotels, travel connections, things to do of local interest, etc., would be useful.  
 Workshops  
 We welcome proposals on all co-located events, in particular, workshops. Please do not hesitate to send your ideas to atva@iis.sinica.edu.tw or directly to any Steering Committee members.
