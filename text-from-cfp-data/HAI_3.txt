 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN)  
 Area Chairs  : Long Tran-Thanh, Bo An, Marc Lanctot, Chongjie Zhang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Xu, Jakob Foerster  
 Topics  :  
 Reasoning and learning under uncertainty 
  Supervised learning 
  Unsupervised and representation learning 
  Reinforcement learning 
  Multiagent learning 
  Evolutionary algorithms 
  Learning agent capabilities 
  Learning agent-to-agent interactions

  Adversarial learning 
  Description  : Autonomous Agents must sense, deliberate, act and communicate in potentially complex and uncertain environments. In addition, in many cases, they must interact with other agents and/or humans. Anticipating each situation and hardcoding the appropriate agent behavior becomes impossible as the complexity of the environment and interactions increase. As such, adaptivity and learning are key properties that imbue autonomy to agents operating and communicating in the real world. Papers in this area focus on all aspects of single agent and multiagent planning, learning and communication.  
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP)  
 Area Chairs  : Reshef Meir, Nisarg Shah, Georgios Piliouras, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Rica Gonen

  Cooperative Games 
  Description  : This area encompasses research on cooperative and non-cooperative games, social choice, and mechanism design, specifically focusing on computational aspects such as algorithmic and complexity analysis for equilibrium computation and verification. The area also welcomes theoretical explorations and analysis related to game theory, mechanism and market design, and social choice. Submissions showcasing practical applications of game theory are also strongly encouraged.  
 Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE)  
 Area Chairs  : Felipe Meneguzzi, Pradeep Murukannaiah  
 Topics:   
 Coordination and teamwork 
  Social network analysis 
  Norms, normative systems

  Non-strategic coalition/team formation 
  Communication, including using natural language 
  Policy, regulation, and accountability

  Agreement Technologies: Negotiation and Argumentations 
  Responsible socio-technical systems 
  Description  : Research in agent and multiagent systems has a long history of developing techniques that balance agent autonomy, adaptation, and distributed social reasoning with system-level considerations such as organizational and institutional policy enforcement addressing safety, security and fairness considerations. Teamwork and human-machine cooperation has an increased relevance with the transformation of our societies into socio-technical systems. We need to ensure transparency, foster trust, and ensure social reasoning conforms to societal norms and expectations. We also need to ensure human-machine and machine-machine cooperation is fostered responsibly, within an adequate accountability system and in alignment with the ethical values of individuals concerned. We encourage the submission of papers that highlight the design, development, evaluation, simulation, and analysis of novel, innovative, and impactful research on issues related to the above topics.

  Description  : This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to knowledge representation and reasoning in single-agent and multi-agent systems. Knowledge representation is to be understood broadly, ranging from theoretical contributions (e.g., epistemic, strategic, description, and other logics) to representation learning. Moreover, representation and reasoning in complex settings often entails reasoning about sensing and perception. Relevant forms of reasoning include, for instance, automated reasoning and theorem proving approaches, verification-based approaches, as well as probabilistic reasoning and neurosymbolic approaches, as long as they are applied to, or motivated by reasoning about agents and/or multiagent systems.

Naturally, the scope of this area spans the entire software engineering lifecycle — from requirements and verification to testing, validation, and evolution.  
 Modeling and Simulation of (Artificial) Societies (SIM)

  Description  : Artificial societies are computer simulations or models that are created to emulate and research the behavior of intricate social systems. These societies simulate the interactions and dynamics of people, animals or other organisms to understand how individual behaviors lead to emergent structures and interactions. Agent-based models of artificial society provide a way to analyze the impact of regulations, incentives and other interventions that help to understand the complex dynamics of society as a whole. The area aims to find efficient solutions to model and simulate complex societal systems using agents-based models. Important application areas include ecology, biology, economics, transportation, management, organizational, and social sciences in general. In these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, exploration and testing of hypotheses, and better system designs.  
 Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)  
 Area Chairs  : Michael Goodrich, Birgit Lugrin  
 Topics  :  
 Human-agent interaction 
  Agent-based analysis of human interactions 
  Socially interactive agents 
  Trust and explainability in human-agent interactions 
  Human-robot interaction and collaboration 
  Social robotics and social interactions 
  Mixed-initiative and shared autonomy in human-agent interactions 
  Groups of humans and agents 
  Agents models and architectures for interaction with humans 
  Designing for human-agent interaction 
  Virtual humans 
  Description  :  
 Human interaction with artificially intelligent agents is becoming more commonplace, as such, developing and evaluating agents that can understand humans’ dynamics to support competent interaction. Significant challenges arise when transitioning from pure multiagent systems to hybrid systems that need to incorporate bi-directional human and agent interactions and sustain different competitive or collaborative situations. Agents need new models and architectures to better address the interaction with humans, including perception and recognition of humans’ internal states and activities at different levels, interaction modalities that support true coordination, and incorporation of human factors and ethics concerns. The design of human-agent interaction needs special concerns that combine requirements from the perspectives of both the agents and the humans. The interactive behavior of such agents can be inspired by human-human interaction and can, additionally, be embodied by virtual agents or robots to scaffold intuitive interaction.

 Special Tracks  
 In addition to the main track, AAMAS 2025 will feature four special tracks: the AAAI Resubmissions Track   , the Blue Sky Ideas Track   , the JAAMAS Track  , and the Demo Track  , each with a separate Call for Papers (to be posted when available).  
 The focus of the Blue Sky Ideas Track is on visionary ideas, long-term challenges, new research opportunities, and controversial debate. The JAAMAS Track offers authors of papers recently published in the journal Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems  (JAAMAS) that have not previously appeared as full papers in an archival conference the opportunity to present their work at AAMAS 2025. The Demo Track, finally, allows participants from both academia and industry to showcase their latest developments in agent-based and robotic systems.
