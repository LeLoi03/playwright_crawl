 Call Summary    
  
 The 9th International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning (RuleML+RR 2025) is the leading international joint conference in the field of rule-based reasoning. A main goal of RuleML+RR is to build bridges between academia and industry in the area of semantic reasoning.   
 RuleML+RR 2025 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the foundations and applications of rules and reasoning. It provides a forum for stimulating cooperation between different communities focused on the research, development, and applications of rule-based systems. We solicit high-quality papers related to theoretical advances, novel technologies, and applications that involve rule-based representation and reasoning or other declarative forms of artificial intelligence.   
 The RuleML+RR 2025 conference is part of the event “Declarative AI: Rules, Reasoning, Decisions, and Explanations” and is co-located with DecisionCAMP 2025 and the Reasoning Web Summer School 2025.

 RuleML+RR welcomes research from all areas of Rules and Reasoning. The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:   
 Ontology/Semantic Web   
 Vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules 
  Ontology-based data access 
  Rules for knowledge graph creation 
  Rules for knowledge graph embeddings and ontology learning 
  Rule-based data integration 
  Data management and data interoperability for web data 
  Distributed agent-based systems for the web 
  Rules for AI and AI for Rules   
 Rule-based approaches to natural language processing 
  Machine learning approaches involving rules 
  Explainable AI approaches based on rules 
  FAIRness approaches based on rules 
  Rule-based approaches for intelligent systems and intelligent information access 
  Rules and Reasoning / Logics

  Description Logics, existential rules 
  Higher-order and modal rules 
  Constraint programming 
  Logic programming, ASP, and Datalog 
  Rule-based argumentation 
  Rule-based approaches to agents and multi-agent systems 
  Reasoning with incomplete, inconsistent and uncertain data

 Submission and Publication    
  
 High-quality papers related to theoretical advances, novel technologies, and artificial intelligence applications concerning explainable algorithmic decision-making that involve rule-based representation and reasoning are solicited.   
 We accept the following submission formats for papers:   
 Long papers (up to 15 pages in  LNCS style   including references) 
  Short papers (up to 8 pages in   LNCS style   including references) 
   
  Long papers should present original and significant research and/or development results. Short papers should concisely describe general results or specific applications, systems, or position statements. All submissions must be prepared in Springer's LNCS style (  http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html   ).   
  
  Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with formal proceedings. Double submission to a workshop with informal proceedings is allowed. Papers put on arXiv are also allowed as long as they are not refereed (i.e., formally reviewed by peers).   
  
  A Special Issue of  Theory and Practice of Logic Programming   is planned with extended versions of selected papers.   
  
  Submissions to the RuleML+RR conference:   
 have the page limit of 15 (/8) pages including references 
  are not anonymous 
  can have additional material included as an external report (appendices to the submission are not permitted and a paper should be self-contained) 
   
  Papers should be written in English can be submitted using EasyChair:   
  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rulemlrr2025    
  
  The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS) after the conference.   
  
  The best paper will be awarded the RuleML+RR Harold Boley Distinguished Paper Award 2025 and best student paper will be awarded the RuleML+RR Best Student Paper Award 2025.   

 Important Dates    
  
 June 2nd, 2025  : Title and abstract submission 
  June 9th, 2025  : Paper submission deadline 
  July 28th, 2025  : Notification of acceptance 
  September 22nd–24th, 2025  : Conference 
  For each of these deadlines, a cut-off point of 23:59 AOE applies.
