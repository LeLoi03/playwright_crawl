 ICSME 2024  
   
 The International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)  is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and debate the most recent ideas, experiences, and challenges in software maintenance and evolution. The 40th edition of the conference (ICSME 2024) will be in Flagstaff, AZ, United States.  
 Why Flagstaff?   
 There are SEVERAL reasons to come to Flagstaff besides ICSME    
 Located in the mountains of northern Arizona, Flagstaff is not  the Arizona experience you may expect  . Flagstaff enjoys mild temperatures due to its high altitude (7000 feet / 2100 meters) and low humidity. In October, Flagstaff’s average high temperature in the afternoon is 18 o  C (64 F), and the daily low temperature in the middle of the night is 0 o  C (32 F).  
 Although Flagstaff is a relatively small city, it is a major tourist destination  that receives more than 5 million tourists per year  because of its proximity to many tourist attractions. It is close to Grand Canyon National Park and in the midst of a large Ponderosa pine forest. Rich with excitement and alive with cultural diversity, beauty, and history, visitors are attracted to the clean mountain air, year-round outdoor recreation, lively festivals, and historic charm.  
 Hiking and nature are the highlights of Flagstaff. Some of the attractions that Flagstaff offers:  
 The | Grand Canyon | is a worldwide recognized tourist destination (less than a two-hour drive from Flagstaff). 
  Sedona | is renowned for its stunning red rock landscapes and vibrant arts community. It draws visitors from around the world and is less than a one-hour drive from Flagstaff. 
  Sunset Crater, Walnut Canyon, and Wupatki | National Monuments are also less than a one-hour drive from Flagstaff. 
  Monument Valley | , frequently featured in Holywood movies, is less than three hours driving from Flagstaff. Take the opportunity and also visit the Antelope Canyon (reservation in advance is recommended). 
  The | Museum of Northern Arizona | and | Lowell Observatory | (where Pluto was discovered in 1930) are located just minutes from downtown Flagstaff. 
  Route 66 | remains a historic route, passing through Flagstaff. U.S. Route 66, or Mother Road, was one of the original highways in the U.S. It is recognized in popular culture, including music, movies, and cartoons. 
  Find more details in the Attending menu.  
 Flying to Flagstaff   
 You can fly directly to Flagstaff Pulliam Airport (FLG). However, it is currently served only by American Airlines and its Oneworld alliance partners. Another option is to fly to Phoenix (PHX) and take a 3-hour shuttle or bus ( Groome.com  , FlixBus  , or Greyhound  ) from the airport to the conference venue or rent a car and drive for approximately 2 hours. Alternatively, you can fly to Las Vegas (LAS), which is a longer but scenic drive to Flagstaff.
