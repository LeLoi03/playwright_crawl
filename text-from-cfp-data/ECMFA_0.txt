  Research Track 
  Call for Papers   
 In order to foster a lively exchange of perspectives on the subject of the conference, the programme committee of ICGT 2025 encourages all kinds of contributions related to graphs and graph transformation, either from a theoretical point of view or a practical one.  
 Topics   
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following subjects:  
 General models of graph transformation (e.g. adhesive categories and hyperedge replacement systems) 
  Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems 
  Graph-based machine learning, including graph neural networks and models of rule inference 
  Graph theoretical properties of graph languages 
  Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages 
  Logical aspects of graph transformation 
  Computational models based on graphs 
  Structuring and modularisation of graph transformation 
  Hierarchical graphs and decomposition of graphs 
  Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformation 
  Term graph and string diagram rewriting 
  Petri nets and other models of concurrency 
  Business process models and notations 
  Bigraphs and bigraphical reactive systems 
  Graph databases and graph queries 
  Model-driven development and model transformation 
  Model checking, program analysis and verification, simulation and animation 
  Syntax, semantics and implementation of programming languages, including domain-specific and visual languages 
  Graph transformation languages and tool support 
  Efficient algorithms (e.g. pattern matching, graph traversal, network analysis) 
  Applications and case studies in software engineering (e.g. software architectures, refactoring, access control, and service-orientation) 
  Applications to computing paradigms (e.g. bio-inspired, quantum, ubiquitous, and visual) 
  Graph transformation and artificial intelligence (e.g., AI for graph transformations, applying graph transformations in AI engineering and search-based software engineering) 
  Important Dates   
 Abstracts: 28 Jan 2025 
  Paper Submission: 4 Feb 2025 
  Notification: 25 Mar 2025 
  Final version due: 15 Apr 2025 
  Conference: within 10-13 Jun 2025 
  All deadlines are by end-of-day, AoE  
 Submission Types   
 Authors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. We are currently in discussion whether to go Open Access for ICGT 2025. We will update and detail the calls as soon as possible.  
 (1) Regular research papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), including papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix.  
 (2) Tool presentation papers  (up to XX pages, excluding references and appendices), which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description (up to XX pages) which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings.  
 (3) Blue Skies  (up to XX pages), reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories.  
 Furthermore, there will also be a Journal-First track  allowing for previously published work (in book chapters, journals, or other conferences since 2021) to be presented at ICGT 2025.  
 Special Issue   
 Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA).
