 PAPER TYPES AND FORMATS  

 LREC-COLING 2024 invites high-quality submissions written in English. Submissions of three forms of papers will be considered:   
 Regular long papers | – up to eight (8) pages maximum*, presenting substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work. 
  Short papers | – up to four (4) pages*, describing a small focused contribution, negative results, system demonstrations, etc. 
  Position papers | – up to eight (8) pages*, discussing key hot topics, challenges and open issues, as well as cross-fertilization between computational linguistics and other disciplines. 
  * Excluding any number of additional pages for references, ethical consideration, conflict-of-interest, as well as data, and code availability statements.   
   
 Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers will be given one additional page – up to nine (9) pages of content plus unlimited pages for acknowledgments and references – so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. Final versions of short papers may have up to five (5) pages, plus unlimited pages for acknowledgments and references. For both long and short papers, all figures and tables that are part of the main text must fit within these page limits.   
   
 Furthermore, appendices or supplementary material will also be allowed ONLY in the final, camera-ready version, but not during submission, as papers should be reviewed without the need to refer to any supplementary materials.   
   
 Linguistic examples, if any, should be presented in the original language but also glossed into English to allow accessibility for a broader audience.   
 Note that paper types are decisions made orthogonal to the eventual, final form of presentation (i.e., oral versus poster).   

 PAPER SUBMISSIONS AND TEMPLATES  

 Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system via the link:   
 https://softconf.com/lrec-coling2024/papers/     
 Both long and short papers must follow the LREC-COLING 2024 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded from the Style Files and Formatting page provided on the website. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.  

 AUTHOR RESPONSIBILITIES  

 Papers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. Papers must be anonymized  to support double-blind reviewing. Submissions thus must not include authors’ names and affiliations. The submissions should also avoid links to non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material in the final version of the paper, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub   or Anonym Share   ). Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.  
 If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated on the submission form but not in the paper itself. In addition, LREC-COLING 2024 will follow the same policy as ACL conferences establishing an anonymity period during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed.  
 More specifically, direct submissions to LREC-COLING 2024 may not be made available online (e.g. via a preprint server) in a non-anonymized form after September 22, 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (for arXiv, note that this refers to submission time).  
 Also included in that policy are instructions to reviewers to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints. Authors are asked to cite published versions of papers instead of preprint versions when possible.  
 Papers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must be declared at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at LREC-COLING 2024, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at LREC-COLING 2024 is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the LREC-COLING 2024 committee must be notified immediately  

 ETHICS STATEMENT  

 We encourage all authors submitting to LREC-COLING 2024 to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of their work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages for long, 4 pages for short papers).  

 PRESENTATION REQUIREMENT  

 All papers accepted to the main conference track must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings, and at least one author must register for LREC-COLING2024. Papers will be presented either orally or as posters. The specific presentation modality of a paper will be decided based on its content, with no difference in quality implied. Papers that include a demonstration component will be presented as posters.  
 All papers accepted to the main conference will be required to submit a presentation video. The conference will be hybrid, with an emphasis on encouraging interaction between the online and in-person modalities, and thus presentations can be either on-site or virtual.
