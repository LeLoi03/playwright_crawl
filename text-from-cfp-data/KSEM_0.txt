 Call for Papers   
 [ CFP Download in pdf  ]  
 The conference committee invites submissions of both applied and theoretical research, as well as application-oriented papers on all topics related to KSEM. For KSEM 2024, we are particularly focused on the theme of applied knowledge science and engineering in networking and cybersecurity, which includes the use of large language models (LLM). Submissions are not limited to these topics, and we welcome contributions across a broad range of areas, as detailed below:  
 Knowledge Science   
 • Knowledge representation and reasoning  
  • Formal analysis of knowledge; reasoning about knowledge  
  • Knowledge complexity and knowledge metrics  
  • Uncertainty in knowledge (randomness, fuzziness, roughness, vagueness)  
  • Knowledge fusion for decision making  
  • Formal ontologies  
  • Reasoning about knowledge in the presence of inconsistency, incompleteness and context-dependency  
  • Belief propagation, revision and aggregation  
  • Cognitive foundations of knowledge  
  • Integration of machine learning and knowledge representation  
  • Knowledge-driven learning  
  • Knowledge for cognitive robotics  
  • Knowledge for cognitive analytics  
  • Knowledge in complex systems (e.g. manufacture assembling, economical and quantum systems)  
  • Game-theoretical aspects of knowledge; knowledge in multi-agent systems  
   
 Knowledge Engineering   
 • Knowledge modeling  
  • Knowledge acquisition, such as knowledge modules, temporal knowledge, etc.  
  • Knowledge extraction from texts/videos, big data/Web  
  • Knowledge discovery from very large databases
