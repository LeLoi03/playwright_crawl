 DLS 2022 invites high quality papers reporting original research and experience related to the design, implementation, and applications of dynamic languages. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 innovative language features 
  innovative implementation techniques 
  innovative applications 
  development environments and tools 
  experience reports and case studies 
  domain-oriented programming 
  late binding, dynamic composition, and run-time adaptation 
  reflection and metaprogramming 
  software evolution 
  language symbiosis and multi-paradigm languages 
  dynamic optimization 
  interpretation 
  just-in-time and ahead-of-time compilation 
  soft/optional/gradual typing 
  hardware support 
  educational approaches and perspectives 
  semantics of dynamic languages 
  frameworks and languages for the Cloud and the IoT 
  Submission Details   
 Submissions must neither be previously published nor under review at other events. DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind, two-phase reviewing process.  
 Papers are assumed to be in one of the following categories:  
 Research Papers  : describe work that advances the current state of the art  
 Experience Papers  : describe insights gained from substantive practical applications that should be of a broad interest  
 Dynamic Pearls  : describe a known idea in an appealing way to remind the community and capture a reader’s interest  
 The program committee will evaluate each paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality. The paper category needs to be indicated during submission, and papers are judged accordingly.  
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM SIGPLAN conference acmart format, 10 point font, and should not exceed 12 pages. Please see full details in the Instructions for Authors.  
 DLS 2022 will run a two-phase reviewing process to help authors make their final papers the best that they can be. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and will be freely available for one month, starting two weeks before the event.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 Instructions for Authors  
   
 Submitted papers need to conform to the formatting instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review at the discretion of the Program Chair.  
 DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations in their paper submissions.  
 Submission Site   
 Please take a moment to read the instructions below before using the submission site. After acceptance, the camera-ready versions will be collected by Conference Publishing Consulting.  
 Concurrent Submissions   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  .  
 Format   
 Submissions should use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart  format  , sigplan  sub-format, 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format. If you use LaTeX or Word, please use the provided ACM SIGPLAN acmart templates  . Author–year and numeric citation styles are both acceptable.  
 Note that by default the SIGPLAN Conference Format templates produce papers in 9 point font. If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to set the 10pt  option in the \documentclass  command: \documentclass[10pt,sigplan]{acmart}  . If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size.  
 For reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission with the LaTeX \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  command.  
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.  
 Page Limit   
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, papers are limited to 12 pages and 10pt including bibliographic references and appendices. For the second phase, the page limit is 14 pages including bibliographic references.  
 Second-Phase Revisions   
 DLS 2022 uses a two-phase review system to provide authors with extra support and an opportunity to revise submissions. The extent of revisions is limited by the available time of about 4 weeks, so the program committee will use the two-phase process only for mandatory revisions that can be completed in that time.  
 To facilitate reviewing, we ask that the revisions be accompanied with:  
 Highlighted changes, either done manually or with a tool such as | latexdiff 
  A brief, high-level description of changes, and how they address the concerns raised in the reviews 
  For the second phase, the page limit is 14 pages, including bibliographic references  .  
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)   
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
