 General Information  
 Having been established in 1999, the Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES) conference is the premier venue for research on both design and analysis of cryptographic hardware and software implementations. As an area conference of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), CHES bridges the cryptographic research and engineering communities, and attracts participants from academia, industry, government and beyond. CHES 2025 will take place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in September 14-18, 2025. The conference website is accessible at  
 https://ches.iacr.org/2025    
 The scope of CHES is intentionally diverse, meaning we solicit submission of papers on topics including, but not limited to, the following:  
 Cryptographic implementations:  Hardware architectures 
  Cryptographic processors and coprocessors 
  True and pseudorandom number generators 
  Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) 
  Efficient software implementation 
  SHARCS (Special-purpose HARdware for Cryptanalysis, quantum included) 
  Attacks against implementations, and countermeasures:  Remote, micro-architectural and physical side-channel attacks and countermeasures 
  Fault attacks and countermeasures 
  Hardware tampering and tamper-resistance 
  White-box cryptography and code obfuscation 
  Reverse engineering of hardware/software 
  Hardware trojans and countermeasures 
  Tools and methodologies:  Formal methods, techniques and tools for secure design and verification for hardware/software 
  Computer aided cryptographic engineering 
  Domain-specific languages for cryptographic systems 
  Metrics for the security of embedded systems 
  FPGA design security 
  Physical assurance and analysis of embedded systems 
  Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)    
 Interactions between cryptographic theory and implementation issues:  Quantum cryptanalysis 
  Algorithm subversion and subversion prevention 
  New and emerging cryptographic algorithms and protocols targeting embedded devices 
  Theoretical hardware models that allow proofs 
  Applications:  RISC-V security 
  Trusted execution environments and trusted computing platforms 
  IP protection for hardware/software and technologies for anti-counterfeiting 
  Reconfigurable hardware for cryptography 
  Secure elements, security subsystems, and applications 
  Security for the Internet of Things and cyberphysical systems (RFID, sensor networks, smart meters, medical implants, smart devices for home automation, industrial control, automotive, etc.) 
  Secure storage devices (memories, disks, etc.) 
  Isolation and monitoring hardware for cyberresilience 
  Engineering of zero-knowledge proof systems 
  Privacy-preserving computing in practice (MPC, FHE) 
  Post-quantum security

 Author instructions for paper submission are on the submissions page  .  
 TCHES Publication Model  
 CHES has transitioned to an open-access journal/conference hybrid model. A comprehensive list of FAQs relating to the model can be found via the TCHES website at  
 https://tches.iacr.org    
 In summary:  
 Submitted papers will undergo a journal-style review process with accepted papers published by Ruhr University Bochum in an issue of the journal IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (TCHES). Since it has a Gold Open Access status, all papers published in TCHES are immediately and freely available. 
  The annual CHES conference consists of presentations for each paper published in the associated issues of TCHES, plus invited talks and a range of additional and social activities. All papers accepted for publication in TCHES between 15 July of year | n | − 1 and 15 July of year n will be presented at CHES of year | n | .
