 Description 
  Event Tracks 
  Organization 
  It is with great pleasure that Research & Innovation Group wants to welcome every organization or individual that chose to participate on 4th ROME International Conference on Challenges in Engineering, Medical, Economics and Education: Research & Solutions (CEMEERS-24b) scheduled on Dec. 4-6, 2024 Rome (Italy).  
 Following the spring edition of CEMEERS-23, the winter edition of CEMEERS-23b and winter edition of CEMEERS-24a, this autumn edition of CEMEERS-24b will provide an excellent international forum for sharing knowledge and results in engineering, medical, economics and educational environments because in knowledge there are no borders.  
 I am very happy to inform you that the conference is supported by IEEE SB ISEL and IEEE SB ISCTE.  
 Technology is becoming more and more environmentally friendly on full life cycle. Environmental problems are being mitigated by modern technology and better processes. The energy efficiency is a business opportunity so interesting nowadays that companies are making profit on energy savings rather than on energy consumption. Energy storage devices and methods are under profound research to satisfy upwards and downwards slew rate demands.  
 Medical subjects are being faced everyday with new diseases and effects on Human health and quality of life. Past and recently pandemics caught communities off-guard and challenged medical experts and practitioners. With time constrain and limited health systems, solutions from scientific research and innovation rose.  
 Education is not only a vehicle to spread information and knowledge but also to prepare citizens for the labor market. It has always been like that, but soft skills allied with hard skills are of great importance: it is not enough for current job seekers to be smart, ambitious and know how to use technology and one must have developed competencies deal with the intrapersonal relationship and interaction with others.  
 Mathematical modeling has always been used as a very significant tool for answering many concerns of the society emerging in health, social sciences, agriculture, biological sciences and engineering. With its multiple aspects, this emerging tool helps, more frequently, in solving current multidisciplinary problems.  
 All these areas have enormous potential to grow and to increase the qualification of products and services. Industry has a key role on transforming knowledge into case studies. Economics have a key role.  
 The goal of this Conference is to bring together research scholars, delegates and students to interact and share their experience and knowledge in technology application researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to focus on the mentioned areas advancements and establishing new collaborations. Conference participants will have the opportunity to think about new problems and research approaches and participate in critical discussions that promote networking and look for probable solutions for present and future challenges.  
 The various debates on the subject are a matter of greater and better sharing of knowledge for better international governance, hence the need for more information-level cooperation between our academic institutions that are especially dedicated to study in the most varied strands.  
 The CEMEERS-24b is a hybrid conference with possibilities to participate both in person and online. Your participation is essential to make this conference a memorable experience. We hope that this sharing of knowledge will lead to practices to promote, improve, and strengthen communication and create working relationships to seize opportunities for effective change towards common improvement in an era in which we explore new worlds. We look forward to watching your presentations and to share ideas with every participant.  
 Thank you for joining us in the CEMEERS-24b.
