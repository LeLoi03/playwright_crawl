  Scientific paper submission   without    rebuttal procedure:     June 28, 2024 

 Call for Contributions  

 The EuroXR  association ( www.euroxr.org   ) would like to cordially invite you to contribute to the 21st EuroXR International Conference  - EuroXR 2024  .  
 This conference follows a series of successful international conferences initiated in 2004 by the INTUITION Network of Excellence in Virtual and Augmented Reality, supported by the European Commission until 2008. Embedded within the Joint Virtual Reality Conferences (JVRC) from 2009 to 2013, it was known as the EuroVR international conferences from 2014 and until 2020.  
 EuroXR 2024  will be hosted and co-organized by the Institute of Communication & Computer Systems (ICCS)  , Athens, Greece. This year, our International Conference will take place with in-person attendance, so you can expect a rich experience.  
 Beside Invited Keynote  talks and plenary sessions for Scientific  track, Application  track, and Poster & Demo  track in an Exhibition  area, we will also welcome this year joint events related to several European projects in progress, and especially the 1st annual meeting of the Alliance4XR ERASMUS+ project  , and other special sessions for some sister projects of several HORIZON calls.   
  
 TYPES OF CONTRIBUTIONS   

 For all conference tracks, we seek original, high-quality contributions in all areas of eXtended Reality (XR) technologies, and thus related to Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and 3D User Interfaces. In these areas, submissions may address a wide range topics of interest, as listed in https://www.euroxr.org/topics-euroxr2024    .   
 Please note that the calls for contributions for each category are not opened at the same time:  
 Scientific track  [OPEN NOW]   :  Papers (Long, Medium, or Short) must describe novel research results, unpublished papers presenting new research, original research questions in new practices or experience, novel insights in XR/VR/AR/MR, or sound states-of-the-art on challenging research questions in that field.  
  The accepted papers in this track will be published in a Springer LNCS volume (Lecture Notes in Computer Science). For your convenience, indexing information of LNCS series is available on this Springer webpage    .   
  As in previous years, authors of the top papers will get an opportunity to submit an extended version to the journals Computers & Graphics or Frontiers in Virtual Reality. 
  Application track   [OPEN NOW]   :  Extended abstracts, which are meant to describe practical use cases of XR technologies a 
  Poster track  [   OPEN NOW   ]   :  Posters may present preliminary results or work-in-progress of research or application projects. They are submitted as an extended abstract. 
  Demo track  [   OPEN NOW   ]   :  Demos may accompany any type of submission or may be submitted independently. They are submitted as an extended abstract. 
  Extended abstracts (2-4 pages) of accepted Application talks, or accepted Posters and Demos will be published in an ISBN-registered proceedings, edited by VTT, Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd.  
  
 SUBMISSIONS TO THE SCIENTIFIC TRACK   
 This year, two procedures are possible for Scientific paper submissions, which allow authors to choose between two different deadlines.  
 Submissions before the first deadline (May 6) will give access to a reviewing procedure including a rebuttal phase after receiving the initial review reports. This will allow the authors to clarify potential misunderstandings and to resubmit a revised paper before the final decision of the reviewers.  
 Alternatively, the authors can choose to submit to the second deadline (June 24), but will not benefit from the advantage provided by the rebuttal procedure.  
 In both cases, all submissions will be reviewed by at least three independent reviewers.  
  
 Important Dates (  some extended   ) for the Scientific Track  (each deadline is 23:59:59 AoE)  
 Scientific paper submission  with   rebuttal procedure:  May 6   →  May 12, 2024 
  1st notification for papers submitted in the rebuttal procedure: June 17  → June 21, 2024 
  Deadline for revised papers in the rebuttal procedure: June 24  → June 28, 2024 
  Scientific paper submission  without   rebuttal procedure:  June 24   →  June 28, 2024 
  Final notification for all papers (with or without Rebuttal) July 24, 2024 
  Camera-ready (for all tracks): Sep. 16, 2024 
  Conference days: Nov. 27-29, 2024 
   
 Scientific Paper sizes and respective talk durations   
 Three sizes of papers are possible in the Scientific track (all these sizing are excluding reference section):  
 Long paper  : 14-20 pages in the Springer format (about eight pages in traditional two-column format). If accepted, the authors will have about 30 minutes of presentation (including questions) during one of the scientific sessions of the conference. 
  Medium paper  : 8-12 pages in Springer's format. If accepted, the authors will have about 20 minutes of presentation (including questions) during one of the scientific sessions of the conference. 
  Short paper  : 4-6 pages Springer format. This type is meant for work-in-progress, position papers, and similar content. If accepted, the authors will have about 10 minutes of presentation (including questions) during one of the scientific sessions of the conference. 
  Please note that indicated paper lengths do not include references.    

 Please, read carefully the Call for Contributions  where the types of contribution and the expected length of the papers are described together with important dates and a description of the reviewing process.  
 Submissions have to be uploaded to the management system of Springer (EquinOCS)  here: Link here   
 Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published. A manuscript is considered to have been previously published if it has appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, magazine, book or conference proceedings that is reliably and permanently available afterwards in print or electronic form to non-attendees, regardless of the language of that publication. A manuscript identical or substantially similar in content (in its entirety or in part) to one submitted to EuroXR 2024 should not be simultaneously under consideration for another conference or journal during any part of the review process, from the submission deadline until final notifications of decisions are emailed to the authors.  
 In case of acceptance, scientific papers will be published in a Springer LNCS volume (Lecture Notes in Computer Science), and at least one author is expected to present the paper in person at the conference.  
  
 PAPER FORMATING   
 Authors should consult Springer’s Instructions for Authors of Proceedings and use either the LaTeX or the Word templates provided on the authors’ page   for the preparation of their papers. For your convenience, Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available in Overleaf   .  
 To allow for a double-blind peer reviewing process, please make your submissions fully anonymous (no author names, nor affiliation, only anonymous self-references). Relevant previous work by the authors should be cited in the third person to preserve anonymity. Papers which are not anonymous will be automatically desk-rejected.  
  
 CAMERA READY INSTRUCTIONS   
 Authors of accepted contributions will have to prepare a camera-ready file set. This set is composed of:  
 Camera-ready file (PDF), 
  Full source files (i.e. Latex file(s) and all the image files, or the full Word file), 
  Online signature of the Springer Consent-to-Publish form. 
  Videos and other electronic supplementary material, which will be made available in SpringerLink. 
  Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs   with their names and affiliations. We also kindly ask all authors to adhere to Springer’s Code of Conduct: https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct   .  
 The corresponding author of each paper must complete and sign a Springer Consent-to-Publish form, acting on behalf of all of the co-authors of the paper. The author signing this form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. After the camera-ready deadline, no changes to the papers can be made.  
 Thanks to the EquinOCS system, the authors of accepted papers can sign the Springer Consent-to-Publish form online. See detailed instructions here: https://support.springernature.com/en/support/solutions/articles/6000245512-conference-proceeding-authors#6.-Submit-the-Final-version—for-accepted-papers   .
