  Technical Committee 

 MAY 12-15, 2025 AT THE HYATT REGENCY SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO, CA  
 46th IEEE Symposium on  
  Security and Privacy  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy  in cooperation with the International Association for Cryptologic Research   

 Call for Papers   
 Since 1980 in Oakland, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for computer security research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.  
 Topics of interest include:   
 Applied cryptography 
  Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results 
  Authentication, access control, and authorization 
  Blockchains and distributed ledger security 
  Cloud computing security 
  Cyber physical systems security 
  Distributed systems security 
  Economics of security and privacy 
  Embedded systems security 
  Formal methods and verification 
  Hardware security 
  Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse 
  Human-centered security and privacy 
  Intrusion detection and prevention 
  Machine learning and computer security 
  Malware and unwanted software 
  Network security and measurement 
  Operating systems security 
  Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship 
  Program and binary analysis 
  Protocol security 
  Security and privacy metrics 
  Security and privacy policies 
  Security architectures 
  Security for at-risk populations 
  Software supply chain security 
  Systems security 
  User studies for security and privacy 
  Web security and privacy 
  Wireless and mobile security/privacy 
  This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.  
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers   
 As in past years, we solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate and may be rejected without full review. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. You can find an overview of recent SoK papers at https://oaklandsok.github.io  .  
 Submission Deadlines & Decisions   
 Similar to 2024, for each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:  
 Accept:  Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. Within one month of acceptance, all accepted papers must submit a camera-ready copy incorporating reviewer feedback. The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library and they may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 2025”. After the symposium, papers will be behind a paywall for one year before they are again made open access. 
  Reject:  Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&P. A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission. As a rule of thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be considered a resubmission. 
  Public Meta-Reviews:  Similar to 2024, all accepted papers will be published with a meta-review (< 500 words) in the final PDF that lists: (a) the reasons the PC decided to accept the paper and (b) concerns the PC has with the paper. Authors will be given the option to write a response to the meta-review (< 500 words) which will be published as part of the meta-review. Authors will be given a draft meta-review at the time of acceptance. Authors will be given the option of addressing some or all of the concerns within one review cycle. A shepherd will remove concerns from the meta-review if they are sufficiently addressed by the revisions.  
   
  The goal of this process is to provide greater transparency and to better scope change requests made by reviewers. More information about the reasons behind this change can be found on the 2024 IEEE S&P website  .  
 Symposium Event (Important Changes)   
 The number of papers accepted to IEEE S&P continues to grow substantially each year. Due to conference venue limitations and costs, each accepted paper will have: (a) a short talk presentation (e.g., 5-7 minutes, length determined based on the number of accepted papers) and (b) a poster presentation immediately following the talk session containing the paper. All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster.  
 Important Dates   
 All deadlines are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12).  
 First deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: July 22, 2024 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): August 19 - August 30, 2024 
  Rebuttal text due: August 26, 2024 
  Acceptance notification: September 9, 2024 
  Camera-ready deadline: October 18, 2024 
  Second deadline   
 Paper submission deadline: November 14, 2024 
  Early-reject notification: January 20, 2025 
  Rebuttal period (interactive): February 17 - February 28, 2025 
  Rebuttal text due: February 24, 2025 
  Acceptance notification: March 10, 2025 
  Camera-ready deadline: April 18, 2025 
  Rebuttal Period   
 Papers reaching the second round of reviewing will be given an opportunity to write a rebuttal to reviewer questions. The rebuttal period will be interactive, and is separate from the meta-review rebuttal given to accepted papers. Authors have the opportunity to exchange messages with the reviewers and respond to questions asked. To this end, we will use HotCRP’s anonymous communication feature to enable a communication channel between authors and reviewers. The authors should mainly focus on factual errors in the reviews and concrete questions posed by the reviewers. New research results can also be discussed if they help to clarify open questions. More instructions will be sent out to the authors at the beginning of the rebuttal period.  
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers   
 As with previous IEEE S&P symposia with multiple submission cycles, rejected papers must wait one year before resubmission to IEEE S&P. Given the move from three submission deadlines in 2024 to two submission deadlines in 2025, rejected papers are eligible to submit according to the table below.  
  
 2024 deadlines | Reject decision  
  Eligible 2025 deadlines 
 First 2024  
  (April 13, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Second 2024  
  (August 3, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Third 2024  
  (Dec 6, 2023) | Second deadline  
  (Nov 14, 2024) 
  
 Instructions for Paper Submission   
 These instructions apply to both the research papers and systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. All submissions must be original work; the submitter must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there are questions about this policy.  
 Anonymous Submission   
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. PC members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the PC Co-Chairs and the Associate Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper.  
   
 While a paper is under submission to the IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper to an archival repository such as arXiv, and disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors. Authors should refrain from widely advertising their results, but in special circumstances they should contact the PC chairs to discuss exceptions. Authors are not allowed to directly contact PC members to discuss their submission.  
   
 The submissions will be treated confidentially by the PC chairs and the program committee members. Program committee members are not allowed to share the submitted papers with anyone, with the exception of qualified external reviewers approved by the program committee chairs. Please contact the PC chairs if you have any questions or concerns.  
 Conflicts of Interest   
 During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds:  
 The PC member is a co-author of the paper. 
  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years. | For student interns, the student is conflicted with their supervisors and with members of the same research group. If the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not conflicted with a PC member from the larger organization. 
  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years. 
  The PC member is or was the author’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The author is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. 
  For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  
 Research Ethics Committee   
 Similar to 2024, IEEE S&P 2025 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research. The REC will review flagged papers and may suggest to the PC Chairs rejection of a paper on ethical grounds. The REC consists of members of the PC. Authors are encouraged to review the Menlo Report  for general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research.  
 Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure   
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Vulnerability+Disclosure+Policy  to 90 days https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-faq.html  ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.  
   
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.  
   
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Note  : Submitted papers should not  include full CVE identifiers in order to preserve the anonymity of the submission.  
 Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research   
 Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:  
 Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable. 
  Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
  If a submission deals with any kind of personal identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data, the version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken to mitigate harms to the persons identified. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
 Financial and Non-financial competing interests   
 In the interests of transparency and to help readers form their own judgements of potential bias, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. Authors need to include a disclosure of relevant financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers. This includes not just the standard funding lines, but should also include disclosures of any financial interest related to the research described. For example, “Author X is on the Technical Advisory Board of the ByteCoin Foundation,” or “Professor Y is the CTO of DoubleDefense, which specializes in malware analysis.” More information regarding this policy is available here  .  
 Page Limit and Formatting (Important Changes)   
 Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. All text and figures past page 13 must be clearly marked as part of the appendix. The final camera-ready paper must be no more than 18 pages, although, at the PC chairs’ discretion, additional pages may be allowed. Reviewers are not required to read appendices.  
   
 Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. LaTeX submissions using the IEEE templates must use IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.” (That is, begin your LaTeX document with the line \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}.). See the “IEEE Demo Template for Computer Society Conferences” Overleaf template  for an example. We are not aware of an MS Word template that matches this style.  
   
 Papers that fail to use the “compsoc” template (including using the non-compsoc IEEE conference template), modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review. Authors are responsible for verifying the paper format (e.g., compare with the above linked Overleaf template)  . While HotCRP provides some automated checking, the checks are limited. Note that some LaTeX packages (e.g., \usepackage{usenix}) override the compsoc formatting and must be removed.  
 Withdrawing Policy   
 A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.  
 Authorship Policy   
 Changes to the authorship list (adding or removing authors) are not permitted after paper submission. Changes to the authors affiliation after paper acceptance are not permitted without PC chairs approval. If authors anticipate that they might change affiliation during the time the paper is under submission it is recommended to mark both the current and future institution as COI.  
 Conference Submission Server   
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers.
