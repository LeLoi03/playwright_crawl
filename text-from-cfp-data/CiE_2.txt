 GENERAL INFORMATION  
  CiE 2024 will be an anniversary event. It is the 20th conference organized by CiE (Computability in Europe), in the same place as the first edition, Amsterdam.  
 CiE is a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested innew developments in computability and their underlying significance for the real world.  
 Previous meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponta Delgada (2010), Sofia (2011), Cambridge (2012), Milan (2013), Budapest (2014), Bucharest (2015), Paris (2016), Turku (2017), Kiel (2018), Durham (2019), Salerno (2020, virtually), Ghent (2021, virtually), Swansea (2022) and Batumi (2023).

  Monika Seisenberger (Swansea University)  
  Mariya Soskova (University of Wisconsin–Madison)  
 SPECIAL SESSIONS  
  There will be 6 special sessions:  
 Computable aspects of symbolic dynamics and tilings (chairs: Benjamin Hellouin and Ilkka Torma) 
  Algorithmic randomness and Kolmogorov complexity session (chairs: Rupert Hölzl abd Denis Hirschfeldt) 
  Quantum Computation (chairs: Delaram Kahrobaei and Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh) 
  History and Philosophy of Computing (HaPoC) (chairs: Ekaterina Koubychkina and Marianna Girlando) 
  Bio-inspired Computation (BiC) (chairs: Gianluca Della Vedova and Jasmijn Baaijens) 
  Computable Structure Theory (chairs: Stefan Vatev and Ekaterina Fokina) 
  CONFERENCE TOPICS  
  The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science andwith other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics.  
 PAPER SUBMISSION  
  THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related tothe above for presentation at the conference.  
 The following paper categories are welcome:  
 Regular papers describing solid new research results. Papers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Regular papers must have a maximum of 12 pages, including references but excluding a possible appendix in which one can include proofs and other additional material. Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome. 
  Informal presentations. Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2024 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals. 
  All submissions must be in PDF, formatted using the Springer LNCS style (available at https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), and submitted via EquinOCS:  
 https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/CiE2024   
 Accepted regular papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag.

 WOMEN IN COMPUTABILITY  
  We are very happy to announce that within the framework of the Women in Computability program, we are able to offer some grants for junior women researchers who want to participate in CiE 2024. Applications for this grant should be sent to Lorenzo Galeotti <l.galeotti@uva.nl>, before May 15, 2024 and include a short cv (at most 2 pages) and contact information for an academic reference. Preference will be given to junior women researchers who are presenting a paper (including informal presentations) at CiE 2024.  
 HOSTED BY  
  The event will be held in the Amsterdam University College academic building located at Amsterdam Science Park.  
 We are grateful for support from the University of Amsterdam.
