 CALL FOR PAPERS  
   
  The 8th IEEE International Conference on  
  DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS (IEEE DCOSS)  
  May 16 - 18, 2012  
  Hangzhou, China  

   IMPORTANT DATES   
   
 All Submissions: | January 20, 2012  Extended to February 1, 2012 (11:59 PM EST) 
 Notification: | March 20, 2012 
 Camera Ready: | April 8, 2012 (11:59 PM EST) 

  CALL FOR PAPERS   
   
  Distributed sensor systems have become a highly active research area due to their potential for providing diverse new capabilities. Such systems allow intelligent dense monitoring of physical environments. The focus of this conference is on distributed computing issues in largescale networked sensor systems (including algorithms, applications, systematic design techniques and tools, and in-network signal and information processing).  
  Authors are invited to submit original unpublished manuscripts that demonstrate current research on computational aspects of distributed sensor systems. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Machine-to-Machine 
  Sensors in Smart Grid Systems 
  Green Networks and Systems 
  Computation and programming models 
  Energy models, minimization, awareness 
  Distributed collaborative information processing 
  Detection and tracking 
  Theoretical performance analysis: complexity, correctness, scalability 
  Abstractions for modular design 
  Fault tolerance and security 
  Languages, operating systems 
  Task allocation, reprogramming and reconfiguration 
  Dynamic resource management 
  Scalable, heterogeneous architectures (node and system-level) 
  Middleware interfaces, communication and processing primitives 
  Design, simulation and optimization tools for deployment and operation 
  Design automation and application synthesis techniques 
  Closed-loop control for sensing and actuation 
  Case studies: lessons from real world deployments 
  Network coding and compression 
  Paper submission process via EDAS  .
