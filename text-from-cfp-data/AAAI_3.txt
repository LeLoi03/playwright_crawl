 AAAI Classic Paper Award  
  
 The AAAI Classic Paper award honors the author(s) of paper(s) deemed most influential, chosen from a specific conference year. Each year, the time period considered will advance by one year. The 2025 award will be given to the most influential paper(s) from the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Artificial Intelligence.  
 Papers will be judged on the basis of impact, for example:  
 Started a new research (sub)area 
  Led to important applications 
  Answered a long-standing question/issue or clarified what had been murky 
  Made a major advance that figures in the history of the subarea 
  Has been picked up as important and used by other areas within (or outside of) AI 
  Has been very heavily cited 
  All members of the artificial intelligence community are encouraged to submit nominations for this award. Candidacy is not limited to AAAI members, nor to people still active in artificial intelligence. Posthumous awards will be considered.  
 Nominations will be reviewed by the AAAI Awards Committee. Nominations are due September 20, 2024.  
 The award will be presented at the AAAI-25 conference in Philadelphia, PA, USA. A total of $1,000 in travel support is available to enable the author(s) to travel to the conference to accept the award in person.  
 For more information regarding these awards, please contact AAAI ( awards@aaai.org  ).
