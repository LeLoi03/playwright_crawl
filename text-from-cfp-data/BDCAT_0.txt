 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 IEEE/ACM Int’l Conf. on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT 2024)  
   
  16-19 December 2024 Sharjah, UAE  

 We are pleased to inform you that the “11 th  IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT 2024)” will be held in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates between 16 and and 19 December, 2024.  
 Recent years witnessed significant interest in the use of Machine Learning and AI-based techniques to support large data analysis, with research and implementation of systems specifically focused on supporting different phases of the data processing lifecycle. These have ranged from in-memory systems and distributed environments (e.g., MapReduce/Hadoop, Spark) to specialist environments for stream processing of data and events (e.g., Flink, Kinesis) and Serverless (e.g., OpenWhisk, AWS Lambda). On the other hand, we also realise the importance of computational systems required to process small data volumes, but which involve interdependencies and relationships that are hard to capture and derive.  
 The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) is a premier annual conference series aiming to provide a platform for researchers from both academia and industry to present new discoveries in the broad area of big data computing and applications. Previous events were held in London, UK (BDCAT 2014), Limassol, Cyprus (BDCAT 2015), Shanghai, China (BDCAT 2016), Austin, USA (BDCAT 2017), Zurich, Switzerland (BDCAT 2018), Auckland, New Zealand (BDCAT 2019), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2020), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2021), Vancouver, USA (BDCAT 2022), and Taormina, Italy (BDCAT 2023). The BDCAT 2024 will be held in conjunction with the 17th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2024) in Sharjah, UAE.

 PAPER SUBMISSION    

 Submitted manuscripts must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Manuscripts are submitted in PDF format and may not exceed ten (10) IEEE-formatted *double-column* pages, including figures, tables, and references. All manuscripts undergo a double-blind peer-review process and will be reviewed and judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, rigor in analysis, quality of results, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. Your submission is subject to a determination that you are not under any sanctions by IEEE.  
 At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. The conference proceedings will be published by IEEE and made available online via the IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ACM Digital Library.  

 IMPORTANT DATES    

 Time zone: Anywhere in the world!  
  Original Paper Submission Deadline: 20 August 2024,  extended to: 20 September 2024  
  Acceptance Notification: 25 October 2024  
  Camera Ready Papers Due: 5 November 2024  

 AWARDS AND SPECIAL ISSUES    

 A selection committee chaired by the BDCAT 2024 conference co-chairs will select and acknowledge the best paper to receive an award during the conference.  
 Authors of highly rated papers from BDCAT 2024 will be invited to submit an extended version to special issues of prestigious journals.
