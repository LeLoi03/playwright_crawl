 Original Scientific Research   
 AI is becoming more and more prevalent in scientific research. This branch employs data mining, visualization, analysis, statistics, machine learning, and more. AI can help researchers validate existing hypotheses or come up with new ones. Additionally, artificial intelligence can function as a research assistant by extracting data, conducting post-market surveillance, and reviewing the literature.  

 Implementation of Published Papers   
 Published papers are a crucial part of any scientific research, but implementing their findings can be challenging. By default, many scientific papers are long and detailed. You may not need all of the data outlined in the paper. In some case, you will only want to focus only on the most relevant ones, like algorithms.  
   
  AI can help you extract only the information you need. You can use AI to build a stack of relevant papers that you can extract significant information from to support your research.
