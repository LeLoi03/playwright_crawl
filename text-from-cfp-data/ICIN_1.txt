 ICIN 2025 Call For Papers    
 ICIN 2025 solicits original, unpublished work not currently under review by other conferences or journals. Papers submitted to ICIN 2025 will be assessed based on originality, technical soundness, clarity and interest to a wide audience. All submissions must be written in English and must use standard IEEE two-column conference template, available for download from the IEEE website: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process and all submissions must be done electronically through EDAS at: https://edas.info/N32464   
 Technical papers can be up to 8 pages (Full papers) and 5 pages (Short papers), including tables, figures and references.   
 At least one author is required to register, at the full rate, to present accepted papers at the conference and for the paper to appear in the conference proceedings.  
 ICIN 2025 is technically co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE ComSoc and IEEE France Section, all accepted and presented papers will be submitted for publication in IEEE Xplore   
 Authors of selected papers accepted for publication at ICIN 2025 will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (TNSM).
