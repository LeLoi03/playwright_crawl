  ICTAI 2025 -IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)  
 Send this CFP to us by mail: cfp@ourglocal.org  
 Introduction  : The annual IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) provides a major international forum where the creation and exchange of ideas related to artificial intelligence are fostered among academia, industry, and government agencies. The conference facilitates the cross-fertilization of these ideas and promotes their transfer into practical tools, for developing intelligent systems and pursuing artificial intelligence applications. The ICTAI encompasses all technical aspects of specifying, developing and evaluating the theoretical underpinnings and applied mechanisms of the AI based components of computer tools (i.e. algorithms, architectures and languages).
