  News  
 CSR 2007 is over. We thank all participants for coming and making the symposium such a successful event. CSR 2008 will be held in Moscow, see | csr2008.ru | . 
  Some photos from CSR 2007 can be found | here | (by courtesy of Maria Fominykh), | here | (by courtesy of Edward Hirsch), and | here | (by courtesy of Nikolay Vereshchagin). 
  The proceedings of CSR 2007 have appeared as | Volume 4649 | in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. We are grateful to Springer-Verlag and personally to Ingrid Beyer, Alfred Hofmann and Anna Kramer for their extremely efficient co-operation! 
  The | program | of the conference has been updated. It includes now complete schedules for the satellite workshops | WCCDA'07 | and | WIWAD'07 | . 
  , the | largest resource in Russian Internet | , has established Yandex Best Paper Awards and Yandex Best Student Paper Awards for the CSR series. The | Program Committee | has selected the following three papers: | Conjunctive grammars over a unary alphabet: undecidability and unbounded growth | by Artur Jez and Alexander Okhotin - Best Paper in Theory Track; 
  Estimation of the click volume by large scale regression analysis | by Yury Lifshits and Dirk Nowotka - Best Paper in Applications/Technology Track; 
  A fast algorithm for path 2-packing problem | by Maxim Babenko - Best Student Paper. 
  The inauguration of Yandex Awards formed a part of the Business Meeting of CSR 2007 along with the presentations of the awarded papers. Ilya Segalovich  , the company's co-founder and chief technology officer, came in person to the Business Meeting to introduce Yandex Awards.

  Aims and scope  
 CSR 2007 is the second conference in a series of regular events started with CSR 2006  in St Petersburg (see LNCS 3967  ). It intends to reflect the broad scope of international cooperation in computer science. CSR 2007 consists of two tracks: Theory Track and Applications and Technology Track. Typical areas of these tracks include:  
 Theory Track:  
 algorithms, protocols, and data structures; 
  complexity and cryptography; 
  formal languages, automata and their applications to computer science; 
  computational models and concepts; 
  proof theory and applications of logic to computer science. 
  Applications and Technology Track:  
 programming and languages; 
  computer architecture and hardware design; 
  symbolic computing and numerical applications; 
  application software; 
  artificial intelligence; 
  databases and knowledge bases; 
  information retrieval and search; 
  formal methods and verification; 
  constraint programming; 
  software development and testing; 
  Web services.
