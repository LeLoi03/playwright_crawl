  Welcome to the website of the FormaliSE 2019 conference!  
 The software industry has a long-standing and well-earned reputation for failing to deliver high-quality software. Much progress has been achieved from the early days of software development; still, nowadays, even considering the state of the art of the technologies used, the success of software projects is often not guaranteed. Many of the approaches used for developing large, complex software system are still not able to ensure the correct behavior – and the general quality – of the delivered product, despite the efforts of the (often very qualified and skilled) software engineers involved. This is where formal methods can play a significant role. Indeed, they have been developed to provide the means for greater precision and thoroughness in modeling, reasoning about, validating, and documenting the various aspects of software systems during their development. When carefully applied, formal methods can aid all aspects of software creation: user requirement formulation, design, implementation, verification/testing, and the creation of documentation.  
 However, after decades of research, and despite significant advancement, formal methods are still not widely used in industrial software development. We believe that a closer integration of formal methods in software engineering can help increase the quality of software applications, and at the same time highlight the benefits of formal methods in terms also of the generated return on investment (ROI).  
 The main objective of the conference is to foster the integration between the formal methods and the software engineering communities, to strengthen the – still too weak – links between them, and to stimulate researchers to share ideas, techniques, and results, with the ultimate goal to propose novel solutions to the fraught problem of improving the quality of software systems.  
 Originally a successful satellite workshop of ICSE, since 2018 FormaliSE is organised as a 1-day conference co-located with ICSE. FormaliSE 2019 will take place on May 27th, 2019, in Montreal, Canada.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 We invite you to submit a contribution to FormaliSE. Areas of interest include but are not limited to:  
 verification and validation of cyber-physical systems, IoT systems, and autonomous systems; 
  integration of FMs with the rest of the software development lifecycle; 
  use of formal methods in Continuous Integration & Deployment contexts; 
  rigorous software engineering approaches and their tool support; 
  model-based approaches, including model-driven development; 
  scalability of FM applications; 
  prescriptive/objective guidance in the use of FMs; 
  FMs in a certification context; 
  “lightweight” or usable FMs; 
  formal approaches to safety and security-related issues; 
  requirements formalization, formal specification, and verification; 
  performance analysis based on formal approaches; 
  case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches; 
  success stories and/or ability of FMs to handle real-world problems; 
  experimental validation; 
  application experiences. 
  We invite you to submit:  
 Full papers that must describe authors’ original research work and results. 
  Case study papers that should identify lessons learned, validate theoretical results (such as scalability of methods) or provide specific motivation for further research and development. 
  Research ideas: FormaliSE encourages the submissions of new research ideas in order to stimulate discussions at the conference. 
  Full and case study papers are limited to 10 pages, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices, while research ideas papers are limited to 4 pages. 
  Papers must conform to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTEX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf option). See for details: http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html  .  
 Papers must be unpublished original work and should not be under review or submitted elsewhere while being under consideration. PC members will review all submissions. Papers will be judged on the basis of their clarity, relevance, originality, and contribution to the field. Submissions must be in English and uploaded in PDF format through the conference submission website at the following URL: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=formalise2019  .  
 All accepted publications are published as part of the ICSE 2019 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries. The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. Purchase of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed. Authors of accepted papers must register and present their paper at the conference.
