 About 
  Program 
  Accepted Papers 
  Several SIGPLAN conferences have been held virtually or in hybrid mode since March 2020.  
 We invite authors of papers from ICFP, OOPSLA, POPL, and PLDI conferences who were previously only able to present their work in a virtual track, to come to Auckland and present their work in person at SPLASH 2022.  
 NB!  Only papers never presented in past SIGPLAN Tracks of the other conferences are eligible.   
 These presentations will be given during the main conference days, in parallel with OOPSLA and Onward! 2022 presentations. They will not be streamed, since they were already streamed at their respective conferences in a virtual track.  
 Registration deadline: October 1st, 2022  
 Registration to present SIGPLAN OOPSLA/Onward!/POPL/PLDI/ICFP covid-affected papers: please fill up this form  .  
 UPDATE:  We are providing the same opportunity to the COVID-affected authors of GPCE, DLS, SAS, and SLE. To register, please fill up this form  .

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -
