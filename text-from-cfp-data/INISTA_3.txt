 Paper Submission Guidelines     
   
 Template:  Papers must be prepared using IEEE templates for conference proceedings  (pending).  
 Page Limit:  Papers have a maximum page limit of 6  pages including references and graphs. INISTA will offer the option to buy a limited number of extra pages for submission (there will be a charge of 100 euros per extra page).  
 Language:  The official language for the conference is English. Less than satisfactory English usage may form the sole basis for rejection of a paper and omission of any such final paper version from the conference proceedings. Authors whose native language is not English are encouraged to check their papers for proper English spelling and grammar using tools such as English grammar checkers available with most word processing application software. Alternatively, proofreading support from a native English-speaking colleague or technical editor may suffice. Some authors may be interested in the paid service available at the following link: http://www.prof-editing.com/ieee/  (pending) for the final version of the paper.  
 All papers should be submitted via Easychair   .

 Participation Modes     
   
 We are glad to announce that INISTA will be back to an in-person conference! We look forward to welcoming the participants to Tunisia. However, we will keep monitoring the situation of the pandemic to decide later if remote participation would be possible for those having travel restrictions.
