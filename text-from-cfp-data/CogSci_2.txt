 Journal of Cognition: Calls for papers  
 The Journal of Cognition  invites proposals for Special Research Collections, similar to special issues of traditional print journals. Special Research Collections should focus on an important topic within the scope of the journal, and should include at least four manuscripts with corresponding authors from at least four different universities. Interested authors are requested to contact the Editor-in-Chief with a brief summary of the proposed Special Research Collection topic, including titles, authors, and abstracts of the papers that would be included. Special research collections must be approved before the associated manuscripts are submitted. The European Society for Cognitive Psychology will cover the article processing charges if needed for manuscripts accepted as part of a Special Research Collection.
