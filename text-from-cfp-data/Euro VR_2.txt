 Take a decisive step toward fact-based decisions  
 Through efficiency, quality and ease of use, Research AI enables you to think in a data-driven, fact-based and unbiased way.  

 We understand you in  
    
 Making wise decisions is the key to success in virtually any field of work. Yet there is little guidance available to help nurture this unique and valuable skill. This is where our Research AI proves to be your most valuable companion, with a unique combination of human-curated, rich data, perfectly intuitive operation, speed, and an almost infinite variety of languages. Choosing Research AI will therefore be the first of many great decisions you will make in the future.  
   
 What is the most spoken language in the world?  

 As of 2023, English is the most spoken language worldwide when considering both native and second-language speakers, with approximately 1.5 billion people speaking it [1]. Mandarin Chinese is the second most spoken, with around 1.14 billion speakers [2][1]. These figures include speakers of these languages as a mother tongue or a second language used in everyday life. It's important to note that while Mandarin has the highest number of native speakers, estimated at around 917 million [3], the inclusion of second-language speakers propels English to the top spot globally.  

 Ease of use  
 Complex requests solved simply  
 While your questions may be complex, the tool you use to answer them shouldn’t be. That’s why Research AI is designed to give you exactly the valuable insights you’re looking for, regardless of your experience with AI or Statista, what language you speak, or how specific your search is.  

 Efficiency  
 Your shortcut to lasting good decisions  
 Time is money, as they say, so urgency is key. However, it’s a real shame to see your savings go up in smoke due to poor decisions. Research AI offers a double advantage: find insights in the blink of an eye that will lead you to eternally sound decisions.  

 Quality  
 Half human, half AI  
 The decisions you are facing are too important to be made on the basis of opaque, possibly erroneous data. With Research AI, artificial and human intelligence work hand in hand to create unique synergies: the AI presents you with data that has been curated and carefully checked by Statista experts.  
 The best solution to transform complex data into understandable insights: Research AI.  

 Innovation  
 Uniquely customized  
 Knowledge is not the same as insight. However, reliable decisions can only be made on the basis of real findings that meet individual requirements. Unlike generic statistical AIs, Research AI provides you with a customized narrative based on high-quality data collected and/or verified by Statista experts. In other words, it gives you real insight.

 The people behind Research AI  
 Empowering people with data  
 We are Statista, a global data and business intelligence platform with an extensive collection of statistics, reports, and insights. As pioneers in the data economy, we strive to create a world that is more transparent, reliable, and trustworthy. By empowering people with data, we want to help them build a better society by making fact-based decisions.  

 Media’s favorite source  
 The largest and most trusted media organizations in the world all have one thing in common: they love to cite Statista – and increasingly so. While we’re honored to be referenced in great articles and reports, we’re perhaps even more flattered that major consulting firms like BCG and McKinsey, as well as prestigious universities such as Oxford and Harvard, use Statista to provide fact-based insights.

 Our database is useful for everyone. With 170 industries and 150+ countries & territories, a unique combination of exclusive in-house statistics, generally accessible data, and exclusive data partnerships as well as 22,500 different sources, we cover a huge range – and provide a depth of information that is unique in its breadth.

 Getting started   

 Functionality & features   

 General   

  How does Research AI work?   
 Research AI V1 leverages semantic search and Cohere technology to pinpoint the most pertinent Statista data for any given user query. Research AI accesses content and datasets from the 10 most relevant sources, links them to the user query, and feeds the bundled information into our LLM (Claude 3 Sonnet). This process generates detailed responses, and we integrate citations directly into the text, making the narratives easy to understand and fact-check.  
   
  What content does Research AI provide?   
 In its initial release, Research AI delivers concise, written responses tailored to user queries, integrating statistics, infographics, diverse topics, and key insights from market research. Each answer highlights its sources for easy verification and deeper understanding. Beyond direct answers, Research AI suggests personalized follow-up questions to further explore insights. Additionally, it curates a selection of related content, offering users a comprehensive view based on their interests.  
   
  How can I access Research AI?   
 Initially, Research AI will be accessible to all users free of charge for the first two weeks following its launch. All you need to do is register for free. This introductory offer allows you to explore and utilize the full capabilities of Research AI without any immediate cost.  

  How reliable are the answers from Research AI?   
 Research AI delivers answers built upon carefully selected and validated content from a broad spectrum of credible sources, including Statista’s rich database of statistics and reports. Although the platform aims for accuracy, due to the way automated systems work, occasional inconsistencies or errors may naturally occur. We therefore recommend that users check the information against the original sources and critically scrutinize it before using the answers to make important decisions. This approach ensures a balanced and sensible use of the tool.  
   
  What types of content are used to generate my response?   
 Research AI crafts responses using a wide range of proprietary Statista data. This includes detailed descriptions and datasets from all available statistics, alongside information from topic pages, report pages, industry pages, and infographics. The tool also integrates key findings from Market Insights. However, it does not currently include data from Consumer Insights and Company Insights. This diverse content mix ensures that answers are well-rounded and informative, drawing from a comprehensive Statista database.  
   
  How many languages are supported by Research AI?   
 Research AI supports a wide variety of languages, including English, German, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Italian, leveraging the capabilities of Cohere and Claude 3 Sonnet, which are trained on over 100 languages. Response quality may vary by language due to differences in the amount of training data available. For optimal results, the tool responds in the language of the query, but if the quality is insufficient, it is recommended to use English due to its extensive training dataset.  

  What is the difference between Research AI and the Statista search?   
 Research AI and Statista search differ significantly in terms of technology and user experience. Powered by AI technologies such as Claude 3 Sonnet, Research AI uses semantic search and Cohere’s Large Language Model (LLM) for nuanced understanding and tailored, context-relevant responses. It interprets user intent to provide comprehensive answers from a vast dataset. In contrast, Statista search is a keyword-based tool for finding specific data points and content. The search provides a list of relevant content for the user to get closer to the insight.  
   
  Is data from the Company Insights and Consumer Insights products also included in Research AI?   
 In its initial version, Research AI does not incorporate data from the Company Insights and Consumer Insights products. For information specific to these areas, users are advised to utilize the dedicated tools provided for Company Insights and Consumer Insights directly.  
   
  How can I provide feedback or report an issue with Research AI?   
 To provide feedback or report an issue with Research AI, please utilize the integrated feedback feature within the platform. Your input is crucial to our ongoing efforts to improve the product, and we greatly appreciate your support and cooperation.
