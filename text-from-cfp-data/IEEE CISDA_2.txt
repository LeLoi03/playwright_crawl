 Complexity and Self-Organization | Frontiers Research Topic  

 Complexity occurs when relevant interactions prevent the study of elements of a system in isolation. These interactions between elements may lead to the self-organization of the system. In computational intelligence, complexity and self-organization have been studied and exploited with different purposes. This Research Topic aims to bring together novel research into a coherent collection, spanning from theory and methods to simulations and applications.  
 Computational measures of complexity and self-organization have been proposed and applied to study a broad range of phenomena. Methodologies for facing complexity and harnessing self-organization have been used to design and build a variety of systems. Computer simulations have been tools which enabled us to study complexity and self-organization, from cellular automata and artificial neural networks to multi-agent systems and computational social science. The applications of these approaches have been vast.  
 Considering that complexity and self-organization are very broad themes, this Research Topic focusses only on the aspects related to computational intelligence.
