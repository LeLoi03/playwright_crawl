 Call for Papers  
 Download CFP Flyer  ISKE aims to provide a platform for technical and scientific professionals from academia, research and industries in the fields of intelligent systems and knowledge engineering to exchange knowledge and distribute the emerging state-of-the-art technologies. ISKE 2025 accepts submissions that have not been published or submitted in any form elsewhere. Besides technical and research papers, submissions reporting on industrial case studies are also welcome. Accepted papers will be published in a conference proceeding by IEEE. The proceedings will be submitted and reviewed by the IEEE Xplore and EI Compendex and Scopus after the conference.
