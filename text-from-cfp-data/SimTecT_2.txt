 Almost perfect   
 If i could give it 4.5 I would but I'm much more inclined to say I'm happy with this product. Really good quality, excellent resource for my vet suturing practice. I have a mild complaint about the silk sutures, they rip/ fray more easily than I hoped, but easily rectified by buying new ones (which are cheap) and also encourages me to be more gentle with my knots. I'm so happy with it and it's a perfect still revising break from studying. Thank you Sim and Skills!!!

 Feedback from university students and lecturers   
 Student Feedback: Feedback was gathered from 13 students. Overall, they liked the trainer and would recommend it to their peers for learning blood glucose testing. They found the trainer easy to use and helpful in demonstrating the procedure. The students felt that the trainer added significant value to their training, with the main benefit being an increased competency in blood glucose testing.  
 Lecturer Feedback: Feedback was collected from 7 lecturers. Most of them found the trainer to be authentic and effective in simulating the challenges of blood sugar testing. They appreciated that it encouraged patient communication, which is a great plus. The product was of good quality and reliable for teaching purposes. However, there was a minor issue with the finger becoming leaky after multiple uses. Despite this, the lecturers agreed that the trainer prepares students well for real-world blood glucose testing.

 Excellent hand model   
 As a proud owner of a Sim & Skills Foot & Ankle model, I thought it was time I invested in a Hand & Wrist.  
 My clients find it really helpful when we are discussing anatomy and it really aids their recovery.  
 I believe client education and knowing that your body is something to be enjoyed, not feared, is such an important platform for recovery from chronic pain.

 Useful piece of equipment   
 This item is very useful for NG insertion training, it can be used in a horizontal position and the fluid bag does not leak out. The bag and tubing can all be stored within the head making storage of the item easy. It is very simple to use and the head is strong and durable
