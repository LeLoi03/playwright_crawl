  Forum on Digital Ethics in Research 

   Beyond Compliance 2024   
  
 Details   Last Updated: 14 October 2024     
   
 Research Ethics in the Digital Age  
 14-15 October 2024  
 HUN-REN SZTAKI - HUN-REN Institute for Computer Science and Control, Budapest, Hungary and online  
    
 Researchers  in digital sciences face tough ethical questions in their daily activity for which there aren't yet consensual answers among the research community. The ERCIM forum "Beyond Compliance" aims at advancing the discussion about those issues. The target audience is composed by researchers and Research Ethics Boards. The event consists of keynotes, presentations, tutorials and interactive sessions, and provides ample time for open discussions. Different outcomes are envisioned, including some which may be directed towards policy makers.
