 2011 | The following technical papers were selected as the "top 5" papers at the conference, on the strength of the reviews received from the PC. The winners were invited to send an extended version of their conference paper for consideration for a special issue of IST Journal. In no particular order, our selected papers are: An Empirical Investigation of Systematic Reviews in Software Engineering; Zhang and Ali Babar 
  End-User Programmers and their Communities: An Artifact-Based Analysis; Stolee, Elbaum and Sarma 
  Design of an Empirical Study for Comparing the Usability of Concurrent Programming Languages; Nanz, Torshizi, Pedroni and Meyer 
  One Technique is Not Enough: A Comparison of Vulnerability Discovery Techniques; Austin and Williams 
  An Empirical Study on the Use of Team Building Criteria in Software Projects; Da Silva, Fran�a, Gouveia, Monteiro, Cardozo and Suassun 
  IEEE Software sponsored an award for the best paper in the industry experience track. The criteria were that the selected paper should be well-written and of high-quality, but also be able to influence the state of the practice. The winner is expected to be an example of the kind of practical, experiential, yet rigorous papers that are of interest to IEEE Software readers. The winning paper was selected by a review committee that consisted of IEEE Software Editor in Chief Forrest Shull, the Industry Experience track chair Brian Robinson, and additional members drawn from both the magazine's editorial board and the experience track's program committee: Mark Grechanik, Maurizio Morisio, and Helen Sharp.  
  The winning paper was:
