 Call for Submissions   
  
 The AIME 2025 conference invites all interested researchers to submit original contributions on the development of theory, methods, systems, and applications of AI in biomedicine, including the application of AI approaches in biomedical informatics, healthcare organization, and molecular medicine.  

 Important Dates   
  
 Submission opening: October 1, 2024  
  Abstract submission deadline: January 27, 2025  
  Paper submission deadline: February 3, 2025  
  Notification of acceptance: March 26, 2025  
  Camera-ready submission deadline: April 8, 2025  
  Main conference: June 23-26, 2025  

 Scope   
  
 Contributions to theory and methods should present or analyze novel AI theories or methodologies for solving problems in the biomedical field. They may propose new theories and methods or extensions of existing ones. In either case, the work should demonstrate its utility for solving biomedical problems and highlight its contribution to the underlying theoretical foundations. In addition, it should discuss assumptions, limitations, and novelty with respect to the state of the art.  
 Contributions addressing systems and applications should describe the development, implementation or evaluation of innovative, AI-based tools and systems in the biomedical application domain. These papers should both link the work to the underlying theory and either analyze the potential benefits for solving biomedical problems or provide empirical evidence of benefits in clinical practice.  
 The scope of the conference includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:  
 Machine learning and big data analytics 
  Natural language processing 
  Document classification and information retrieval 
  Large language models and their biomedical applications 
  AI for biomedical imaging 
  AI for signal processing and time series analysis 
  Foundational models and zero/few shots learning 
  Multimodal learning and information fusion 
  Data and knowledge integration, graph neural networks 
  Visual analytics in biomedicine 
  Bayesian networks, fuzzy logic and reasoning under uncertainty 
  Temporal and spatial representation and reasoning 
  Biomedical ontologies and terminologies 
  Knowledge-based reasoning in biomedicine 
  Clinical decision support systems 
  Healthcare processes and workflow management 
  Computerized clinical practice guidelines and protocols 
  Patient engagement support (personal healthcare record) 
  Explainable AI 
  Precision medicine 
  AI solutions for ambient assisted living, telemedicine, and e-health 

 Awards   
  
 The Mario Stefanelli award  is given to the best student paper, according to the conference steering committee, based on the quality of both the paper and oral presentation at the conference.  
 The Marco Ramoni award  is given to the best regular paper, according to the conference steering committee, based on the scientific quality of the paper.  
 AIME Rising Star award  is aimed at younger colleagues running their labs with recent breakthrough papers in the area. If you would like to nominate someone for this award, please email your proposal to annette.ten.teije@vu.nl  and robertmo@bgu.ac.il  by March 1st. The criteria for the award and other information will be available on the AIME 2025 website  .  

 Student Travel Grants   
  
 We will offer six travel grants to students who are authors of accepted papers (full or short) and who will present their work during the AIME 2025 conference. Each grant will cover travel costs up to EUR 500.00 (if these costs are less than EUR 500.00, the actual amount will be covered).  
 Preference will be given to students who are not members of the Doctoral Consortium (the latter will provide participation grants). We will also take into account the quality of the submitted work as indicated by the reviews. Applications will be accepted until April 30, 2025, decisions will be announced in early May, and grants will be awarded during the conference. Applicants should send the title of their accepted paper, formal proof of student status, and an electronic copy or scan of their tickets by email to silvia.ferrari@pragmacongressi.it  with the subject line “AIME 2025 Student travel grants”.  

 Submission   
  
 Papers should be submitted to the AIME 2025 Easy Chair Website  . Authors are asked first to submit an abstract (maximum 250 words), the full paper may be uploaded up to one week later (please see Important Dates above).  
 The conference features regular papers in three categories (please note if you are a student submitting a paper):  
 Full-length research papers (up to 10 pages, including references) 
  Short papers (max 5 pages, including references), describing a short research project with preliminary results or late-breaking results (work-in-progress) 
  Demo papers (max 5 pages, including references), describing a demonstration of implemented systems 
  Demos of applications are welcome, authors must submit a demo paper (see above). The demo track will provide opportunities to present software to individuals and small groups of attendees.  
 All accepted papers (full, short & demo) will be published in the conference proceedings, which will be published as part of Springer’s Lecture Notes in AI series. Papers should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS format and one of the categories (Full paper, Short paper, Demo paper) must be selected at the time of submission. Authors should follow Springer’s guidelines for authors  and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, to prepare their papers. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available in Overleaf. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their submissions.  

 Publication   
  
 The proceedings will be published by Springer as part of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI)  , a subseries of LNCS  dedicated to artificial intelligence research. Please note that for a paper to be published, at least one of its authors must pay a full registration fee.  
 Proceedings from prior AIME conferences can be viewed on SpringerLink  .  
 Authors of the best accepted papers will be invited to expand and refine their manuscripts for possible publication in the Elsevier journal Artificial Intelligence in Medicine  .
