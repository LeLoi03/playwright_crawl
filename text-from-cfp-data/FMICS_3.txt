 Details   Announcements     05 July 2024    Last Updated: 05 July 2024     Hits: 790    
 Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik is accepting proposals for scientific seminars/workshops in all areas of computer science, in particular also in connection with other fields.  
 If accepted, the event will be hosted in the seclusion of Dagstuhl’s well known, own, dedicated facilities in Wadern on the western fringe of Germany. Moreover, the Dagstuhl office will assume most of the organisational/ administrative work, and the Dagstuhl scientific staff will support the organizers in preparing, running, and documenting the event. Thanks to subsidies the costs are very low for participants.  
 Dagstuhl events are typically proposed by a group of three to four outstanding researchers of different affiliations. This organizer team should represent a range of research communities and reflect Dagstuhl’s international orientation. More information, in particular details about event form and setup, as well as the proposal form and the proposing process, can be found on  
 https://www.dagstuhl.de/dsproposal   
 Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik is funded by the German federal and state government. It pursues a mission of furthering world class research in computer science by facilitating communication and interaction between researchers.  
 Important Dates   
 Next submission period: October 15 to November 1, 2024 
  Seminar dates: Between October 2025 and August 2026 (tentative). 

 Next issue: January 2025
