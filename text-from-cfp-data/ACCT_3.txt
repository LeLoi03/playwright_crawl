 Dagstuhl-Seminar — Solving Problems on Graphs: From Structure to Algorithms   
   
 19 Jan 2025 - 24 Jan 2025 • Schloss Dagstuhl, Wadern, Germany   

 Organizer:   
   
 Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik   

 Abstract:   
   
 Many discrete optimization problems can be modelled as graph problems, leading to a long list of well-studied problems, which include graph partitioning, covering and packing problems, network design problems, width parameter problems, and so on. Most of these graph problems are computationally hard. However, this situation may change if we require the input to belong to some special graph class. This leads to two fundamental questions, which lie at the heart of our Dagstuhl Seminar: for which classes of graphs can a computationally hard graph problem be solved in polynomial time, and for which classes of graphs does the problem remain hard? In our seminar, we aim to discover new insights that lead to results for a whole range of problems rather than just for a single problem alone.   

 Topics:   
   
 Graph Algorithms, Graph Classes, Graph Containment, Relations, Parameterized Complexity, Width Parameters

 Random ergodic optimization   
   
 30 Jun 2025 - 11 Jul 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France   

 Organizer:   
   
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques   

 Abstract:   
   
 Ergodic optimization is a general framework in dynamical system where an observable is understood through its minimum over the set of invariant probability measures. A measure that attained that minimum is called minimizing. The general question is to understand the set of minimizing measures and more generally the set of minimizing orbits. One possible approach is to see minimizing measures as ground states, that is as limits of Gibbs measures at zero temperature. Gibbs measures are eigensolutions of the Ruelle operator or the transfer operator. We intend to study such questions in the framework of skew products of dynamical systems where the base dynamics is random (ergodic and invertible) and the fiber dynamics is a composition of maps indexed by a random environment. The problem of optimizing an observable in a random environment is new and has not yet been studied.
