 Call for Papers   

 The ISoLA Symposium is a forum for developers, users, and researchers to discuss issues related to the adoption and use of rigorous tools for the specification, analysis, verification, certification, construction, test, and maintenance of systems from the point of view of their different application domains. To bridge the gap between designers and developers of (formal methods based) rigorous tools, and users in engineering and in other disciplines, it fosters and exploits synergetic relationships among scientists, engineers, software developers, decision makers, and other critical thinkers.   
 In particular, by providing a venue for the discussion of common problems, requirements, algorithms, methodologies, and practices, ISoLA aims at supporting researchers in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, flexibility and efficiency of tools for building systems and users in their search of adequate solutions to their problems. Applications and case studies with a conceptual message and experience papers with a clear link to tool construction are all encouraged.   

 The Symposium features invited  Thematic tracks and sessions   containing  Research, Survey, Experience, Panel  and  Tool contributions  on the:
