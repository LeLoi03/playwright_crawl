 My research concentrates on the technology underlying the design and development of the next generation of digital game. Current projects related to this work include: Computer-Aided Exercise: | looking at how digital games can increase enjoyment of physical exercise. 
  Game networking: | focusing on novel techniques for specifying networking and consistency algorithms in distributed games. 
  Simulation Games | examining how gaming technology can improve simulation-based training. 
  For more information, see the EQUIS Lab home page  . I am director of the EQUIS lab  and member of the Software Technology Laboratory  . These students  are current and past members of the group.  
 I am a member and former Chair of IFIP Working Group 2.7  on User Interface Engineering.

  Personal  
 I am a Professor of Computer Science at Queen's University. I received the Doctorate of Engineering (Dr.-Ing.) degree from the T.U. Berlin  in 1995. I performed most of my thesis work at the GMD  in Karlsruhe  , Germany  . I hold an M.Sc. from Queen's University  (1988) and a B.Sc. from the University of Toronto  (1985). I have worked on the Turing  project as a Computer Systems Programmer at the Computer Systems Research Institute  (1985-86), as a Research Associate on the Nial  project at Queen's University  (1988-89), as a Visiting Researcher at the GMD  (1989-92), as an Assistant Professor at York University  (1993-1997) and as VP Research and Development at Namzak Labs  (2000-present.)  
 I was born in Dundee  ( Scotland  ), and have since lived in Kingston  ( Jamaica  ), Toronto  ( Canada  ), Kingston  ( Canada  ), Karlsruhe  ( Germany  ), Trondheim  ( Norway  ) and Grenoble  ( France  ).
