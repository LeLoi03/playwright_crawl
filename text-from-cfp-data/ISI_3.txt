 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTION  

 Authors are invited to submit their original research work that has not previously been submitted or published in any other venue.  
  At least one of the authors of any accepted paper is requested to register and present the paper at the conference.  
  All submissions must conform to the IEEE paper formatting and submission instructions.  
  To help ensure correct formatting, please use the IEEE style files for conference proceedings as a template for your submission. These include LaTeX and Word style files, which are available at https://template-selector.ieee.org/secure/templateSelector/publicationType (choose Conferences > LaTeX | Word).  
  Each research paper should have at most 6 pages, while each abstract and industry paper should have at most 2 pages, including figures, tables and references. A maximum of two extra pages per paper is allowed (i. e., up to 8 pages for research paper and 4 pages for abstract and industry paper), but with additional charge)  
  Please note that IEEE CAI 2025 will pursue a double-blind review process. All submissions must be anonymised and may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. This policy applies to any supplementary or linked material as well, including code.  
  According to IEEE Publications Regarding AI-Generated Text The use of artificial intelligence (AI) generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.
