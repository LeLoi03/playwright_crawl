  Call for Papers 

 We invite you to submit a paper for the HP3C-2025 International Conference and join us for a premier event at this vibrant city. We invite submissions from all relevant areas of the HP3C field, broadly defined. We will continue to accept abstracts after the deadline for as long as space is available. We encourage you to submit early.  
   
 If you require an early confirmation for visa or budgetary reasons, please indicate this to our conference secretary in order to get an earlier review.
