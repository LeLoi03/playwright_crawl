  ECTEL 2024 

 Nineteenth European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning  
 Inclusive and equitable quality education for all  
 Krems, Austria, 16-20 September 2024  

 Call for Papers  
 The European Conference on Technology-Enhanced Learning (ECTEL) engages researchers, practitioners, educational developers, entrepreneurs, industry leaders and policy makers to address current challenges and advances in the field. ECTEL 2024 will take place face-to-face on 16-20 September 2024 in Krems, Austria, with the theme What is the role of TEL to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all?    

 Theme  
 In a world undergoing rapid transformation due to technological advancements (e.g., Generative Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, and Connectivity Technologies), the education landscape is also expanding with new possibilities. However, these advancements bring complex challenges, including effective adoption of technology in educational settings, ethical concerns, and the possible digital divide these technologies could create. Therefore, the theme for the 2024 conference aims to investigate the role of Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) in achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal for education: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”  
 This year’s conference explores the role of TEL within this critical context. We invite submissions that enhance our comprehension of how TEL can promote an equitable, high-quality education for all. Topics of interest include but are not limited to strategies for strengthening digital/AI literacy, facilitating lifelong learning, improving accessibility, and mitigating the digital divide issue. We are interested in papers that not only explore the adoption of emerging technologies for enhancing the educational experience but also explore the limitations of these technologies and undertake investigations in different learning environments and cross-cultural settings. In alignment with the focus on sustainability in past ECTEL conferences, we also welcome papers that offer insights into the scalable and sustainable deployment of these technologies.  
 The topics of interest are grouped into seven blocks. The detailed list of topics of interest for the conference can be found here  .  
 Pedagogical and theoretical underpinning of educational technologies 
  Technologies used for learning 
  Individual, social, and organisational learning processes 
  Ethics, privacy, regulations and policies 
  Learning communities and contexts 
  Global teaching and learning 
  Quality education for underrepresented groups 
  We invite submissions through research papers, demonstrations, posters  , and workshops  . In addition, a doctoral consortium  will be organised to run concurrently with the workshops, offering a platform for doctoral candidates to present and discuss their research.  

 Submission Formats  
 Research papers (8-15 pages, including references)  
 No matter the length, research papers are expected to be mature research contributions to the field of technology-enhanced learning. Research papers should clearly define research objectives and questions that fit within the scope of the conference and its topics. In addition, research papers should discuss the state-of-the-art in the area in which the work is framed, how the new proposal advances state of the art, present an appropriate research methodology, as well as present and discuss the results of the research conducted. Preliminary results or work in progress fit very well in the poster paper category. Research papers should highlight their novelty and contribution to the field. It is important for ECTEL 2024 research papers to consider both technology and learning.  
 Accepted research papers will be published in LNCS Springer Conference Proceedings.  

 Poster papers (4-6 pages, including references)  
 Poster Papers report on significant work-in-progress research and developments that fit within the scope of the conference and its topics. Theoretical and practice-oriented contributions are welcomed. The submission should include theoretical background, a description of the work, preliminary results, and references.  
 Accepted poster papers will be published in LNCS Springer Conference Proceedings.  

 Demonstration papers (4-6 pages, including references)  
 Demonstration papers are expected to describe innovative TEL applications, practices and prototypes aligned with the conference theme and topics (e.g. dashboards, recommender systems, chatbots, practice-oriented contributions, etc.). The submission should include pedagogical and technological background, a description of the application/practice/prototype/use case to demonstrate its relevance, results and outcomes achieved, future agenda and/or next steps.   
 Accepted demonstration papers will be published in LNCS Springer Conference Proceedings.  

 Workshop proposals  
 Workshops provide a venue for community building and idea generation for emerging research topics to groups of like-minded researchers and practitioners, further elaborating on how learning technologies can add educational value to the different stakeholders and contribute to effective education.  
 Workshop proposals will not be published in the conference proceedings.  
 Workshops Organisers interested in coordinating a workshop are welcome to submit a proposal by filling out a form available on this page  .  

 Doctoral Consortium (5-10 pages, including references)  
 The Doctoral Consortium is an exceptional opportunity for PhD candidates to present, discuss, and receive feedback on their research in an interdisciplinary and international atmosphere. Prominent professors and researchers in the field of Technology-Enhanced Learning will provide formative feedback to the selected papers through the review process and contribute actively to discussions at the workshop.  
    
 The submissions will be submitted for publication in CEUR Workshops Proceedings  .   
 More information on preparing the submission and application procedures will be made available early next year.

 Doctoral Consortium papers will be published in CEUR Workshop Proceedings ( CEUR-WS  ).  

 Statement on Open Science  
 As in previous years, we want to encourage Open Science within the EATEL research community. We therefore encourage authors to document their research in a reproducible and verifiable manner, and in general to use Open Science best practices. Two best practices that we specifically would be happy to see in ECTEL 2024 research papers are:   
 Pre-registration. Results from empirical studies are more robust when researchers predefine a research and analysis plan and register it before data collection. To do so, we encourage authors to use services like | AsPredicted | and the | Open Science Framework | to preregister their research so that confirmatory and exploratory analyses can be better evaluated. The research manuscript should then include a link to the preregistration repository. 
  Sharing data and code for replication purposes. Sharing data sources (always anonymised!) as well as the scripts or programs you used to analyse them can help other researchers to reproduce, replicate or extend your analysis. We encourage authors to share this information by providing a link to the data and code in the manuscript. 

 Invitation to publish in a Special Issue for the Journal of Computer Assisted Learning or IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies  
 Best paper nominations and additional selected papers will be invited to submit an extended article to a Special Issue dedicated to ECTEL 2024 in Wiley’s Journal of Computer Assisted Learning  or as a regular submission to IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies  . The extended articles need to have 30% new content and contain design-relevant knowledge as envisioned by each journal.  
 The extended papers submitted to either of the two venues will undergo a new review process and acceptance is not guaranteed.
