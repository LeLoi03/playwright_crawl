 IMPORTANT DATES  
  ==============================================

  Workshop Authors Notification: March 27, 2024  
  Camera-Ready Papers: April 5, 2024  
 SCOPE  
  ==============================================  
 The main focus of EOMAS is on the role, importance, and application of modeling and simulation within the extended organizational and enterprise context. This context implies that systems and software applications are designed to enable certain business processes, and to facilitate interaction of the actors, the system, and the environment. Thus, application of modeling and simulation in this extended context involves several number of socio-technical aspects (Information Systems (IS), Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), Software Systems, and Business Systems, Business Processes, Human Interaction, etc.), as well as technical challenges such as security, big data, and approaches to develop these artifacts such as Agile methods and frameworks etc.  
 SUGGESTED TOPICS  
  ==============================================  
 Enterprise Modeling and Simulation 
  Information Systems Modeling and Simulation 
  Business Processes Modeling and Simulation 
  Organizational Modeling and Simulation 
  Ontological and Conceptual Modeling 
  Domain-specific Modeling and Languages 
  Business Rules and Constrain Modeling 
  Modeling and Simulation Methods, Techniques, and Tools 
  Modeling and Simulation Tools Demonstration 
  Modeling and Simulation Guidelines for Practitioners 
  Case Studies on Modeling and Simulation 
  Simulations for Model Verification and implementations of Simulation Models 
  Requirements Modeling and Simulation 
  Usage of graph and network models and other new concepts 
  Declarative methods for creating models and applications 
  Model-Driven Engineering and transformation between different types of models, for example: ontological, conceptual, process, business, relational, network, implementational, etc 
  New theories in modeling. New types of models. Combinations of different types of diagrams and their mutual interrelationships 
  Educational Methods in Enterprise Modeling and Simulation. How they are taught in different universities. Inverted curriculum concept of teaching of software engineering 
  Human and Cognitive Aspects of Modeling 
  The use of AI (e.g. language models like Chat GPT) in software engineering and modeling and how to use these new ideas and tools 
  Modeling and simulation applied to support Agile methods and frameworks 
  Information modeling as a support for Digital Twins 
  Usage of information modeling and simulation in new areas and their application in fields other than software engineering or informational technologies 
  ⇒ It is possible to accept articles that do not directly fit the above topics if judged attractive. We support new and not yet-popular ideas – because we want to be a platform or incubator and motivate the professional public, our colleagues and doctoral students. But we will only take such papers if there is some innovation in the text. ⇐  
 PAPER FORMATS  
  ==============================================  
 – Standard papers: max. 15 pages long presenting mature research results  
  – Short papers: max. 8 pages long presenting preliminary research results and case studies  
  – Flash talks (5-10 mins) “Show us your project”  
 Authors may indicate to submit their papers into one of the categories by themselves, or chairs may decide, based on the reviews, to accept a standard paper as a short paper or a flash talk.  
 Both standard and short papers will be published in the Springer volume proceedings and indexed.  
 Papers should be submitted in PDF format. Submissions must conform to Springer‚ LNCS format and should not exceed 15 pages, including all text, figures, references, and appendices. Submissions not conforming to the LNCS format, exceeding 15 pages, or being obviously out of the workshop’s scope will be rejected without review. See the guidelines here: https://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html  .
