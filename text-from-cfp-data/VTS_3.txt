 Important News:   
 The VTS review process for scientific papers is DOUBLE BLIND. Do not include any author names on any submitted documents except in the space provided on the submission form. You must also ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the authors. If you are improving upon your prior work, refer to your prior work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography.   
 Authors will be notified of the disposition of their papers by January 31, 2025  . A submission will be considered as a commitment that, upon acceptance, the author(s) will submit a final camera-ready version of the paper by February 21, 2025 11:59:59pm AoE  .  
 Registration of at least one author by the camera-ready deadline and presentation of the paper at the symposium are also required for inclusion of the paper in the published proceedings. Special Sessions and Innovative Practices are requested to submit a session title, abstract, and list of participants by the related due date and the final PDF by February 21, 2025 11:59:59pm AoE  upon acceptance.  
 VTS 2025 will present a Best Paper Award  based on the evaluations of reviewers, attendees, and an invited panel of judges. We also plan to organize various Student Activities  including the TTTC Best Doctoral Thesis Contest  and Ph.D. Poster Forum  , details for which will be made available through the VTS website.
