 CALL FOR PAPERS   
 20th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering (ENASE 2025)   
 Porto Portugal | April 04 - 06, 2025 | https://enase.scitevents.org/   
 Submission Deadline:  October 29, 2024   
   
 Furthermore, we would like to inform that the event will be of hybrid nature, in the sense that online presentations of accepted papers will be possible for those authors that are unable to travel to the venue.   
 The mission of ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering) is to be a prime international forum to discuss and publish research findings and IT industry experiences with relation to novel approaches to software engineering. The conference acknowledges evolution in systems and software thinking due to contemporary shifts of computing paradigm to e-services, cloud computing, mobile connectivity, business processes, and societal participation. By publishing the latest research on novel approaches to software engineering and by evaluating them against systems and software quality criteria, ENASE conferences advance knowledge and research in software engineering, including and emphasizing service-oriented, business-process driven, and ubiquitous mobile computing. ENASE aims at identifying most hopeful trends and proposing new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in large-scale systems and software development, integration, deployment, delivery, maintenance and evolution.  
 ENASE is organized in 4 major tracks:  
 Theory and Practice of Systems and Applications Development 
  Challenges and Novel Approaches to Systems and Software Engineering (SSE) 
  Systems and Software Quality 
  Systems and Software Engineering (SSE) for Emerging Domains 
  Conference Chair(s)   
 Leszek Maciaszek, Macquarie Univ., Australia and Wroclaw Univ. of Economics and Business, Poland 
  Program Chair(s)
