  ***********************************************************  
   
  The Symposium of Experimental Algorithms 2025 (SEA 2025) will take place from  
  22 to 24 July 2025 in Venice, Italy, in auditorium "Santa Margherita",  
  a historical building from the IX century in the Dorsoduro neighborhood of  
  Venice.  
   
  SEA aims to attract papers from the Computer Science community, the Operations  
  Research/Mathematical Programming community and any other scientific community  
  that is concerned with the main theme of the symposium, namely the role of  
  experimentation and of algorithm engineering techniques in the design and  
  evaluation of algorithms and data structures. Submissions should present  
  significant contributions supported by experimental evaluation, methodological  
  issues in the design and interpretation of experiments, the use of  
  (meta-)heuristics, or application-driven case studies that deepen the  
  understanding of the complexity of a problem.  

  TOPICS OF INTEREST  
   
  Topics include but not limited to:

  BEST PAPER AWARD  
   
  The program committee will identify a submission as the best paper.  

  PROCEEDINGS  
   
  The conference proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International  
  Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs), a series of high-quality conference  
  proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with  
  Schloss Dagstuhl Leibniz Center for Informatics. SEA Proceedings volumes are  
  published according to the principle of OpenAccess, i.e., they are available  
  online and free of charge.  

  SUBMISSION GUIDELINES  
   
  The authors should submit a paper not exceeding 12 pages, excluding the  
  bibliography, the front page (title, keywords, abstract, ...), and a brief  
  appendix of up to 5 pages (figures and tables should be counted as part of  
  the space occupied by the appendix). This year, for the first time in ESA,  
  all papers have to be anonymized so author names and affiliations cannot be  
  included (see Double-Blind Reviewing section). Non-anonymized papers will be  
  desk-rejected.  
   
  Authors are required to use the LaTeX style file supplied for the LIPIcs  
  style, without changing default values nor setting font size options in the  
  "documentclass" statement. Final proceedings papers must be camera-ready  
  in this format. We emphasize that a clearly marked Appendix of up to 5 pages,  
  which will not count toward the 12 page submission limit, can be included and  
  will be read at the referees' discretion. All submissions have to be made via  
  the EasyChair submission page for the conference.  
   
  Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished  
  work or surveys of important results. At the time the paper is submitted to  
  SEA, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same  
  paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published  
  proceedings or by a scientific journal. At least one author of each accepted  
  paper will be expected to attend the conference and present the paper.  
  Specifically, no accepted paper will be published unless an author registers  
  to participate in the conference.  

  DOUBLE-BLIND REVIEWING  
   
  SEA will implement a double-blind review process for the first time. As such,  
  submissions must not disclose the authors' identities in any way. In particular,  
  names, affiliations, and email addresses must be excluded from the paper.  
  Authors should reference their prior work in the third person (e.g., instead of  
  writing "We build on our previous work...", they should write "This work builds  
  on the research of..."). Authors should also take care of the anonymization of  
  accompanying software and data. In particular, they cannot link software hosted  
  on their own GitHub page, but they need to link it anonymously (for example,  
  via DropBox). The authors can insert the public GitHub links back in the  
  proceedings version of their papers. Authors are free to share their ideas and  
  drafts as they usually would. For instance, they can submit to repositories like  
  arXiv or give talks on their research. If there are publicly accessible versions  
  of the submission, authors may mention this in the submission (without including  
  links or citations). Alternatively, they can inform the chairs, who will keep  
  these details confidential unless sharing them is necessary for a fair review.  
   
  Double-blind reviewing aims to allow program committee members and external  
  reviewers to evaluate the paper impartially, without bias. However, it's not  
  intended to make determining the authors' identity impossible through  
  investigation. Authors should not compromise the submission's quality or hinder  
  the review process in the name of anonymity; thus, key references must not be  
  omitted or anonymized. Any authors with questions about the double-blind review  
  process should contact the program committee chairs for clarification. All  
  papers failing to meet anonymization requirements will be desk-rejected.  

  LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS USAGE POLICY  
   
  Papers containing content generated by large language models (LLMs) such as  
  ChatGPT or images created using deep generative models (DGMs) such as  
  StableDiffusion are not allowed, except for:  
   
  - Generating scientific plots displaying data that the authors obtained from  
  experiments (for example: it is allowed to use an LLM for generating Python  
  code that generates plots showing experimental results)  
  - Polishing the text that the authors have personally written.  
   
  Despite using LLMs or DGMs, authors remain fully responsible for ensuring their  
  submissions' accuracy, originality, and quality. We urge authors to maintain the  
  integrity of the academic publishing process and avoid any actions that could be  
  considered scientific misconduct, such as plagiarism and misrepresenting figures.  
   
  If a submission includes LLM-generated text or DGM-generated images, we require  
  the authors to disclose this information to the Program Chairs at the moment of  
  submitting the paper, by checking a dedicated box on EasyChair (and providing  
  details on how they used these models). If the Program Chairs should have concerns  
  regarding potential scientific misconduct (which includes using such models and  
  not declaring it, even for the allowed situations above listed), the submission  
  may be subjected to checks for plagiarism or other violations. Any papers failing  
  to meet these requirements will be desk-rejected, even after the review process.  

  WORKSHOP  
   
  On July 25, 2025, there will be a workshop on Compressed Self-Indexes at the  
  same venue. The occasion of the workshop is the 25th anniversary of the following  
  two important data structures:  
   
  FM-index  
  Paolo Ferragina, Giovanni Manzini.  
  Opportunistic Data Structures with Applications.  
  41st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS '00).  
  Awarded with the Paris Kanellakis Award '22.

  Roberto Grossi, Jeffrey Scott Vitter.  
  Compressed Suffix Arrays and Suffix Trees with Applications to Text Indexing and  
  String Matching.  
  32nd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC '00).  
   
  The workshop will feature invited talks by Giovanni Manzini and Roberto Grossi as  
  well as contributed talks on related topics.
