  Submission Guidelines  
 High-quality papers in all PST-related areas that, at the time of submission, are not under review and have not already been published or accepted for publication elsewhere are solicited. Authors MUST ensure to select the track (Privacy, Security, or Trust) most relevant to their research when submitting their paper. Accepted papers will be accepted as ‘regular’ papers up to 10 pages, or ‘short’ papers of up to 6 pages including references. Up to 2 additional pages will be allowed in each category with over-length charges. Every additional page has a cost of $100.00 (CND). The standard IEEE two-column conference format should be used for all submissions. IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings can be downloaded here. The conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore as in previous editions of the conference. At least one author of an accepted paper must register by July 1, 2025. Accepted (short or regular) papers will be published in the proceedings.   
   
  Double-blind Submission  
 Reviewing will be double-blind: the reviewers will not know the identities of the authors. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper. For effective anonymization please follow these guidelines:  
  Do not include any author's name or affiliation in the title. Do not include any acknowledgments. Refer to your own published work in the third person: use “In the previous work of Jones et al.”, not “In our previous work”. If you cite own papers that are not widely available (e.g., a paper currently under review), use anonymous author names in the citation, for example, an author of the form “A. Anonymous”.
