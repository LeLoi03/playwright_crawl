 DSAA’2022 journal track CFP – Machine Learning journal   
 Data science is a hot topic with an extensive scope, both in terms of theory and applications. Machine Learning forms one of its core foundational pillars. Simultaneously, Data Science applications provide important challenges that can often be addressed only with innovative Machine Learning algorithms and methodologies. This special issue on Foundations of Data Science with Machine Learning Journal (MLJ) will highlight the latest development of the Machine Learning foundations of data science and on the synergy of data science and machine learning.  
 Following the great success of the 2021 MLJ special issue with DSAA’2021, this 2022 special issue will further capture the state-of-the-art machine learning advances for data science. We welcome new developments in statistics, mathematics, informatics and computing-driven machine learning for data science, including foundations, algorithms and models, systems, innovative applications and other research contributions. Accepted papers will be published in MLJ and presented at a Journal Track of the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA’2022)  in Shenzhen, October 2022.
