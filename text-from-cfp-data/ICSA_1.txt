 This award is presented at each ICSA to the author(s) of the paper from the ICSA edition of 10 years ago that is judged to have had the greatest influence on software architecture research and practice since its original publication.  
 Each year a MIP committee (composed of 3 industrial members of the current program committee for ICSA, General Chair and Program Co-chairs) reviews the papers from ICSA n–10 and selects the paper they consider to have been the most influential paper during the past 10 years.  
 In particular, research impact is estimated based on number of citations. The top five papers with the highest citation numbers are submitted to the 3 industrial members of the MIP committee. Each member evaluates the five candidates for industrial impact, and uses 3 points to vote for the most supported one(s). Based on both indicators one recipient is selected.  
 The so-determined most influential papers are:
