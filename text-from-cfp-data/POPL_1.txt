  POPL 2019  ( series  ) /  BEAT 2019 ( series  ) /  BEAT 2019: Fourth Workshop on Behavioral Types  
   
 About 
  Program 
  Accepted Papers 
  Call for Talk Proposals 
  Behavioural types are abstract representations of the sequences of operations that computational entities (say, channels) must perform. Stateful entities offer services in a non-uniform way (one cannot pop from an empty stack); traditional type systems cannot guarantee that operations are only invoked when the entity is in the right state.  
 Context   
 Large-scale software systems rely on message-passing protocols: their correctness largely depends on sound protocol implementations. Behavioral types can help in the specification of correct-by-construction systems, and in verifying that programs respect their intended protocols.  
 Recent years have seen a steady stream of research on behavioral types: their foundations and their transfer to several programming languages. This has led to highly-cited papers in conferences such as POPL and journals such as TOPLAS. Research projects on behavioral types (in the US and Europe) have advanced the theory and applications of behavioral types. There is a sustained interest in specification languages, tools, and frameworks that bring behavioral types into programming practice.  
 Colocated with POPL, BEAT 2019 aims to enable a growing community to meet, present and discuss current work, and to foster (new) collaborations.  
 Invited Speakers   
 BEAT 2019 has the pleasure to have the following invited speakers:  
 Ugo Dal Lago, University of Bologna, Italy 
  Jan Hoffmann, Carnegie Mellon University, USA 
  Rumyana Neykova, Brunel University London, UK 
  Kirstin Peters, Technical University of Berlin, Germany 
  Peter Thiemann, University of Freiburg, Germany

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 Call for Talk Proposals  
  
 BEAT 2019 will feature a combination of invited talks and contributed talks.  
 We solicit talk proposals (3 pages)  on all aspects of behavioral types including, but not limited to, the following:  
 theoretical foundations 
  tool implementations 
  case studies and industrial applications of behavioral types 
  connections with complementary verification techniques 
  new research directions for the future 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Rather than regular paper submissions, authors should submit talk proposals  , intended as engaging presentations of recent research results, possibly already published.  
 A submission to BEAT 2019 would typically fall within one of the following categories:  
 reports of an ongoing work and/or preliminary results; 
  overviews on recent tool implementations (or extensions of an existing tool) based on behavioral types; 
  summaries of an already published paper (or a recent series of papers); 
  overviews of (recent) PhD theses; 
  descriptions of research projects and consortia; 
  manifestos, calls to action, personal views on current and future challenges; 
  overviews of interesting yet underrepresented problems. 
  This list is by no means exhaustive but merely indicative.  
 BEAT 2019 will be an informal venue, oriented to interaction, and so it will have no formal proceedings.  
 Submissions based on already published works should include explicit references/links as appropriate. Reviewers may read such prior published works, but are not obliged to so do.  
 Submissions will be judged by the program committee on the basis of significance, relevance, and potential of an engaging, compelling talk at the workshop.  
 Submission Instructions   
 Submissions should be up to three pages (not including references), as a PDF produced using the EasyChair format  .  
 Please submit your talk proposal via EasyChair:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=beat2019   
 It is understood that for each accepted submission one of the co-authors will attend the workshop and give the talk.  
 Contact Information   
 Prospective authors are encouraged to contact the organizers in case of questions ( beat2019@easychair.org  ).
