 DX 2024 ( series  ) /  Accepted Papers  
   
 For DX’24, we had 45 submissions in total - 3 for the journal-/major conference-first (JMCF) track, and 42 for the main track. Out of the 3 JMCF papers, 3 (100%) were accepted (one conditional). Out of the 42 main track papers, 39 went into the reviewing process where we finally accepted 18 (42.9%) as full papers and 13 (31%) as short papers (max. 14 pages). 8 papers (20.51%) were rejected in our final decisions.  
 Please find below preliminary, alphabetically ordered lists of the papers accepted for inclusion in the DX’24 proceedings:
