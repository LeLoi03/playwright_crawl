CICM brings together the many separate communities that have developed theoretical and practical solutions for mathematical applications such as computation, deduction, knowledge management, and user interfaces. It offers a venue for discussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their integration. Besides the CICM main program soliciting formal CICM submissions there will be associated workshops with separate submission options. We are inviting formal submissions on all topics relating to intelligent computer mathematics, in particular, but not limited to * theorem proving and computer algebra * mathematical knowledge management * digital mathematical libraries The program committee is chaired by Valeria de Paiva, Berkeley and Peter Koepke, Bonn. *** Formal Paper Submissions *** Formal submissions in one of the following categories will be reviewed rigorously and accepted papers will be published in a volume of Springer LNAI: * regular papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) present novel research results * project and survey papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) summarize existing results * system and dataset descriptions (4 to 5 pages + bibliography) present digital artifacts *** Important Dates *** Formal submissions - Abstract deadline: April 28, 2025 - Full paper deadline: May 5, 2025 - Reviews sent to authors: June 16, 2025 - Rebuttals due: June 20, 2025 - Notification of acceptance: July 4, 2025 - Camera-ready copies due: July 18, 2025 - Conference: October 6-11, 2025 *** Submissions *** All submissions should be made via EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm25 using the Springer LNCS style files https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines If software or data is relevant to a paper, a link that provides access to the software/data must be provided to enable reproduction of results. *** Best Papers *** CICM 2025 honors the best paper and best student paper with respect to reviews and program committee discussions with an award. ------------------------------------------------------------------------
