 Scope   
   
 1. Open Track  (Dr. Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu; and Orlando Lima Rua, Polytechnic of Porto, orua@iscap.ipp.pt; Adrian-Horia Dediu, Autonomous University of Lisbon, adediu@autonoma.pt)  
 Any topic in computer ethics, broadly construed. Topics related to the field of computer ethics, conceived broadly to include philosophical, professional, and practical aspects of the field.  
 2. Let’s reevaluate cybersecurity best practices  (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu; and Sabina Szymoniak Czestochowa University of Technology, sabina.szymoniak@icis.pcz.pl)  
 Today’s society is becoming more dependent on technology, where organizations and individuals cannot function without smart devices in their daily lives. Nowadays, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a key role in defining cybersecurity best practices. For example, AI-powered threat detection, anomaly detection, and automated response systems are becoming more sophisticated in identifying and mitigating cyber threats, as well as identifying threats and vulnerabilities. To manage and minimize these data threats, it is important for organizations to reevaluate their cybersecurity strategies and best practices. This track invites articles that discuss the emerging trends in cybersecurity along with their ethical implications of digital interaction when organizations are developing best practices.  
 3. Ethical challenges of human relations in education in the AI era  (Mario Arias-Oliva, Universidad Complutense de Madrid Mar Souto-Romero, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, mario.arias@ucm.es; Antonio Pérez-Portabella, Universitat Rovira i Virgili Graciela Padilla Castillo, Universidad Complutense de Madrid; antonio. perezportabella@urv.cat)  
 Digital technologies offer numerous benefits to educational relationships, including improved communication, collaboration, and access to resources. However, they also present challenges that educators, students, and policymakers must navigate carefully to ensure positive and equitable outcomes. Teacher-student relationships have changed, with teachers becoming facilitators rather than sole sources of knowledge. While technology improves communication between students, teachers, and parents, it can also affect peer relationships, where online collaboration can lead to reduced face-to-face interaction. Excessive digital communication can diminish empathy and social skills, while virtual communities can foster a sense of belonging in online education. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education introduces new dimensions to these relationships. AI-powered tutoring systems and chatbots can provide personalized support to students, but they also raise concerns about the role of human educators and the potential loss of human connection in the learning process. This track welcomes submissions that explore the multifaceted impact of digital technologies on education in general, including contributions on digital human relationships in education, such as changes in teacher-student dynamics, peer interactions, mentoring, virtual communities, and the ethical implications of AI in learning environments.  
 4. Gender and Future Digital Technologies  (Shalini Kesar, Southern Utah University, kesar@suu.edu)  
 With emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, it is important to explore the role of gender, as gender disparity can create barriers to managing and sustaining digital technologies. Diverse perspectives and technological innovation can help overcome challenges to economic growth, productivity, solve complex technological problems, drive innovation, and shape the future of technology across multiple sectors. This track welcomes paper proposals from scholars across all fields, as well as practitioners, policymakers, educators, and others whose work or experiences overlap with this theme.  
 5. The normative challenges of AI literacy  (Ludovica Paseri, UNITO, ludovica.paseri@unito.it; and Ugo Pagallo, UNITO, ugo.pagallo@unito.it)  
 The rapid pace of AI development drives the need for investigations into human-machine and machine-to-machine interactions. Exploring the ethical and legal implications of AI-mediated interactions is critical to safeguarding fundamental and human rights. In addition to the challenges related to the misuse or abuse of AI, an often under-researched but highly relevant topic is AI literacy. The relevance of the topic is shown by Section 10.2 lett. (d) vii of the White House Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI of October 2023, and by Article 4 of the AI Act (EU Reg. 2024/1689) in EU law, which concerns ‘AI literacy’, stating that “Providers and deployers of AI systems shall take measures to ensure, to the best of their ability, a sufficient level of AI literacy of their staff and other persons dealing with the operation and use of AI systems on their behalf”. In this context, it is crucial to question the normative implications of AI literacy, examining the accountability and applicability of the US Executive Order and Article 4 of the AI Act; the various models of AI literacy; risks of inequality and digital exclusion; the social disadvantages arising from the lack of digital skills and competencies, etc. The track is open for applications with the aim of discussing AI literacy from an interdisciplinary perspective to contribute to the debate on responsible and trustworthy uses of AI in different areas, such as healthcare, education, scientific research, and industry, among others.  
 6. (De)stigmatize digital interactions and technologies  (Adam Poulsen, Centre for Brain and Mind, University of Sydney, adam.poulsen@sydney.edu.au; Frank Iorfino, Centre for Brain and Mind, University of Sydney, frank.iorfino@sydney.edu.au)  
 Digital interactions and technologies perpetuate or challenge stigma. For example, persistent stigma around mental health leads young people to turn to social media for mental health information and support. However, they encounter biased moderation or harassment of social media content that negatively impacts stigmatized groups discussing, for example, LGBTQ+ issues or mental health. As another example, sex robots present an opportunity to promote the sexual rights of vulnerable groups, such as those with physical disabilities or the elderly. However, the topic of sex robots remains stigmatized in academia, industry, and the public. This track explores the dual role of digital interactions and technologies in exacerbating and combating stigma. It invites submissions that address stigmatized digital interactions (e.g., sex robot use and virtual reality pornography); stigma-reducing digital interactions (e.g., online mental health resources and help-seeking); stigma-based barriers to digital interactions (e.g., cultural norms and stereotypes); and perpetuating or challenging prejudice against stigmatized groups through digital interactions (e.g., promoting or dismantling online digital activism among stigmatized groups, supporting or hindering rights, advocacy, community building, and empowerment). This track also welcomes articles on related ethical implications and topics, including equity, equality, fairness, justice, access, (in)visibility, cyberbullying, anonymity, and safety.  
 7. Artificial Intelligence: Interpretability and Measurement of its Underlying Ethics  (Ramón Carrasco, Complutense University of Madrid, ramoncar@ucm.es)  
 The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to pass the Turing test is now an indisputable reality. This indicates that AI has reached a level of similarity to human behavior in several aspects, including the ability to speak, reason, and even exhibit a degree of creativity. However, consciousness remains a separate challenge. While it currently seems unlikely that AI could develop true consciousness with existing technology, it is plausible that it could convincingly mimic consciousness, potentially passing a hypothetical “consciousness test.” The rapid evolution of AI suggests its integration into many activities that were previously performed exclusively by humans. This transition raises two critical challenges, which this seminar aims to address: 1) Interpretability of AI: Understanding how and why AI makes decisions is essential to building trust in its use. This can be achieved through approaches such as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); 2) Measuring AI ethics: Given the increasing autonomy of AI, it is crucial to assess, for example, whether its decisions are fair, transparent, and accountable. Assessing these ethical dimensions ensures that AI integrates responsibly into society. This seminar seeks to explore both of these topics, fostering an interdisciplinary dialogue that encourages the development of more understandable and ethically responsible AI.  
 8. Values: the basis for responsible technology and digital interactions  (Kirsten Wahlstrom, University of South Australia, kirsten.wahlstrom@unisa.edu.au; Mamello Thinyane, University of South Australia, mamello.thinyane@unisa.edu.au)  
 Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) permeate almost every sphere of life and have brought about changes that harm some while benefiting others. One example that highlights the ethical risks and challenges associated with automated decision-making processes is the UK Post Office’s Horizon system, which was an accounting system developed by Fujitsu. Horizon had flaws that led the Post Office to take debt collection action against postmasters. Many other adverse impacts of ICTs have been documented, including those associated with recent advances in artificial intelligence. To mitigate these adverse outcomes, many instruments have been formulated; these aim to infuse values into the design, development and deployment of ICTs and shape human-machine interactions. However, this is not trivial, as value tensions arise between different stakeholders and in different contexts. This track invites theoretical, empirical and practical contributions that address ethical considerations across the ICT lifecycle and that explore value tensions in human-machine interactions. Papers across all application domains are invited, with particular interest in papers exploring these issues in the cybersecurity domain and in teaching and professional practice.  
 9. How is AI changing us? How does it change the world?  (Xenia Ziouvelou – Associate Researcher at the National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos (NCSRD-Greece), Head of AI Politeia Lab, xeniaziouvelou@gmail.com)  
 The transformative power of technology is undeniable, permeating every aspect of life. Emerging advances in AI and generative AI are rewriting the rules of what is possible, disrupting established norms in everything from medicine and law to art, education, and research, among others. AI and generative AI tools are changing the way we work, learn, create art, conduct research, consume, and are reshaping the way we interact with humans and technology, the way we communicate, socialize, live, and behave. The interactions between AI, people, and social systems are reshaping our norms and revolutionizing the way our interactions with technology evolve and ultimately change us. While much debate has been needed recently about “human-centric” AI, more research is needed on the conditions under which AI technologies can lead to positive and negative outcomes for human behavior, agency, autonomy, rights, and freedom. As technology reshapes human societies, the need to understand the complex interactions between AI, humans, and social systems, as well as the emerging ethical and social implications, is crucial. Thus, adopting an anticipatory approach to AI development and governance.  
 10. Ethical challenges for business in a digital world  (Pedro Isidoro González Ramírez, Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, pedro.gonzalez@uaslp.mx; Juan Carlos Yañez Luna, Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, jcyl@uaslp.mx)  
 This track explores the intersection of business ethics and the application of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to assess the impact of ethical decision-making on organizational outcomes. As digital interactions become increasingly significant, understanding the ethical dimensions of business practices is crucial to fostering a responsible society. We invite contributions that examine how ethical considerations influence strategic decision-making, particularly in the context of digital communication. Research employing SEM can provide valuable insights into the relationships between ethical practices, customer satisfaction, brand reputation, and financial performance. By integrating theoretical frameworks with empirical analyses, this track aims to foster dialogue on the need to embed ethics in business education and practice. Case studies that demonstrate real-world applications of ethical decision-making and its consequences will be highlighted. This track seeks to engage academics, industry practitioners, and emerging researchers in a collaborative discussion, contributing to the ongoing dialogue on the ethical implications of technology and business in today’s interconnected world. Participants will have the opportunity to present their findings, share experiences and explore new methodologies in the field of business ethics.  
 11. AI, social networks and their influence on youth  (Gonçalo Valadão Matias, Autonomous University, gmatias@autonoma.pt; Isabel Alvarez, Autonomous University, ialvarez@autonoma.pt; and Nuno Silva, Lusiada University, nsas@ulusiada.pt)  
 This track explores the ethical implications of deploying AI on social media platforms primarily used by young people. As AI increasingly shapes young people’s online experiences, it is crucial to examine the ethical considerations, potential impacts, and necessary safeguards. We seek papers that address the complex interplay between AI technologies, ethical frameworks, social media platforms, learning tools, and youth well-being. This track aims to foster interdisciplinary dialogue among researchers, ethicists, AI developers, social scientists, policymakers, educators, and youth advocates. We welcome submissions on topics that include, but are not limited to: 1) Ethical considerations in AI-driven content curation for young users; 2) Privacy and data protection challenges in AI-driven youth-oriented social media; 3) The impact of AI algorithms on youth mental health and development; 4) Designing ethically aligned AI for youth-centric social platforms; 5) Ethical implications of AI-enhanced targeted advertising for young users; 6) Transparency and explainability of AI systems in youth-focused social networks; 7) AI, social networks and their influence on youth civic engagement and political participation; 8) Ethical frameworks for AI development on platforms primarily used by young people; and 9) Social networks and AI tools to facilitate learning and knowledge sharing.
