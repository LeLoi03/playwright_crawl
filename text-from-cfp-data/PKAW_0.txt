 Welcome to PKAW 2023  
 Welcome to the 2023 Principle and practice of data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW). In the past, the workshops have been held in Guilin (2006), Hanoi (2008), Daegu (2010), Kuching (2012), Gold Coast (2014), Phuket (2016), Nanjing (2018), Fiji (2019), Yokohama (2020, online), and Shanghai (2022, hybrid). PKAW 2023 will be collocated with the 20th Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2023) and held virtually in Jakarta, Indonesia in November 2023.  
 PKAW has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art in the areas of knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence (MI, also Artificial Intelligence, AI). PKAW2023 will continue the above focus and welcome the contributions to the multi-disciplinary approach of human and big data-driven knowledge acquisition and AI techniques and applications.  
 AI is changing the way in which organizations innovate and communicate their processes, products and services. Also, in our daily life, AI-embedded devices such as smart speakers are about to become widely used, which extends the possibility of acquiring knowledge from users’ behavior observed through the interaction between those devices and their users. Knowledge acquisition and learning from big data are becoming more challenging than ever. Various knowledge can be acquired not only from human experts but also from heterogeneous data. Multidisciplinary research, including knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning, human-computer interaction, etc., is required to meet the challenge. We invite authors to submit papers on all aspects of these areas.  
 Furthermore, not only in the engineering field but also in the social science field (e.g., economics social networks, and sociology), recent progress in knowledge acquisition and data engineering techniques is realizing interesting applications. We also invite submissions that present applications tested and deployed in real-life settings and lessons learned during this process.  
 Proceedings of PKAW 2023 will be published by Springer as a volume of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series.  For more details, please visit here  .

 Game Theory and Machine Learning for Addressing Societal Challenges: From Theory to Real-World Impact  
 Abstract  : Societal challenges spanning security, environmental sustainability, food security, and transportation often involve complex decision-making by multiple self-interested agents. In our research, we delve into the development of game theory and machine learning-based methodologies and tools to tackle these challenges, with a strong focus on contributing to the social good. In this talk I will introduce our work that has led to successful applications in ferry protection, environmental conservation, and food rescue. Moreover, I will cover our foundational research in inverse game theory scalable game solving, and interpretable multi-agent reinforcement learning. These advancements are motivated by the real-world problems we have been working on and enable us to tackle more complex decision-making scenarios in the future.  
 Bio  : Dr. Fei Fang is an Associate Professor at the Software and Societal Systems Department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Before joining CMU, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS) at Harvard University, hosted by David Parkes and Barbara Grosz. She received her Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Southern California advised by Milind Tambe (now at Harvard). Her research lies in the field of artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems, focusing on integrating machine learning with game theory. Her work has been motivated by and applied to security sustainability, and mobility domains, contributing to the theme of AI for Social Good. She is the recipient of the 2022 Sloan Research Fellowship and IJCAI-21 Computers and Thought Award. She was named to IEEE Intelligent Systems’ “AI’s 10 to Watch” list for 2020. Her work has won the Deployed Application Award at IAAI’23, Best Paper Honorable Mention at HCOMP’22, Best Paper Runner-Up at AAAI’21, Distinguished Paper at IJCAI-ECAI’18, Innovative Application Award at IAAI’16, the Outstanding Paper Award in Computational Sustainability Track at IJCAI’15. She received an NSF CAREER Award in 2021. Her dissertation is selected as the runner-up for IFAAMAS-16 Victor Lesser Distinguished Dissertation Award, and is selected to be the winner of the William F. Ballhaus, Jr. Prize for Excellence in Graduate Engineering Research as well as the Best Dissertation Award in Computer Science at the University of Southern California.

 Knowledge Structurization over Texts: Neural Information Extraction based Approaches and Recent Advances  
 Abstract  : Although recent large language models (LLMs) offer a friendly way to communicate and acquire knowledge from machines, they still suffer from inaccuracy and hallucination issues. In contrast, structured knowledge bases (KBs) can provide reliable, machine-readable facts while preserving human interpretability. In other words, knowledge bases containing these structured entities, relations, events and their semantic connections are currently crucial for powering intelligent applications. However, constructing such knowledge bases relies heavily on extracting structured information from unstructured textual data, with which one can populate knowledge bases with facts harvested from textual corpora in a scalable manner. The process is coined as knowledge structurization. In this talk, I will present the notion of knowledge structurization over texts using neural information extraction techniques, and then I will share our recent work on developing neural models for relation extraction and triplet extraction. Finally, I will discuss open challenges and future directions in improving knowledge structurization quality. I hope this talk will provide valuable insights into bridging the gap between unstructured texts and structured knowledge using neural information extraction. The techniques presented will push the boundaries of automated knowledge base construction.  
 Bio  : Dr. Xiang Zhao is currently a full professor at Laboratory of Big Data and Decision, National University of Defense Technology, China, where he serves as the head of the direction of knowledge systems engineering. In 2013, he got PhD of Computer Science and Engineering, the University of New South Wales, Australia. He is a distinguished member of China Computer Federation (CCF), the deputy secretary general of CCF Technical Committee on Information Systems, a member of CCF Expert Committee on Big Data, an executive member of CCF Technical Committee on Databases. He was selected for the project for high-level young talents of Ministry of Education of China and Young Talents Lift-up Program of China Association for Science and Technology, also a recipient of National Key R&D Program for Young Scientists and ACM SIGMOD China Rising Star Award. His research interests include Knowledge Graphs, Advanced Data Management, and Information Retrieval.
