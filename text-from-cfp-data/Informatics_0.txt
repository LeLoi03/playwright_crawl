 CALL FOR PAPERS  tduhamel    2024-12-01T21:03:24-05:00  The 2025 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI 2025)  
  
 July 12-14, 2025, Hong Kong, China   
 Intelligence and security informatics (ISI) is an interdisciplinary field involving academic researchers in information technology, social and behavioral sciences, computer science, law, and public policy, as well as industry consultants, practitioners, security managers, and chief information security officers who support physical and cyber security missions at the individual, organizational, national, and international levels. Over the past two decades, the IEEE ISI Conference has evolved from its traditional orientation towards the intelligence and security domain to a more integrated alignment of multiple domains, including technology, humans, organizations, and security, aiming to advance our understanding of the interrelationships between these different components, and by integrating recent advances from different domains.   
 The ISI 2025 conference invites academic researchers in the field of ISI and related areas, as well as IT, security, and analytics professionals, intelligence experts, and industry consultants and practitioners in the field, to submit papers and workshop proposals. Research should be relevant to informatics, organizations, public policy, or human behavior in applications of security or protection of local/national/international security in the physical world, cyber-physical systems, and/or cyberspace.

 Submission Guidelines      
  
 All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. Each manuscript must clearly articulate their data (e.g., key metadata, statistical properties, etc.), analytical procedures (e.g., representations, algorithm details, etc.), and evaluation set up and results (e.g., performance metrics, statistical tests, case studies, etc.). Making data, code, and processes publicly available to facilitate scientific reproducibility is not required, but is strongly encouraged.  
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to enable double-blind review. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. If citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs.  
 We accept three types of paper submissions on proposed tracks and related topics: long paper (maximum of 6 pages), short paper (maximum of 3 pages), and poster (1 page). The submission format is PDF that follows IEEE publication format (see the template at IEEE – Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings). Papers should be submitted through the EasyChair submission and review system. Each accepted paper must be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register the conference as an IEEE member before the early registration deadline. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements.  

 Journal Special Issue      
 A number of high-quality papers selected from IEEE ISI 2025 will be invited for extension and submission to the ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems.   

 Important Dates      
 Submission Open: February 1, 2025 
  Submission Deadline: March 15, 2025, 11:59PM EST 
  Acceptance Notification: May 1, 2025 
  Final Paper Deadline: May 15, 2025 
  Early registration deadline: June 1, 2025 
  Conference dates: July 12 – 14, 2025
