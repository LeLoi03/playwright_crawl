 5th IMA and OR Society Conference on Mathematics of Operational Research  
   
 Building on the success of the four previous conferences (held in 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023) this biennial event will aim to draw together the considerable community of researchers and practitioners who use and / or develop innovative mathematics and data driven approaches, relevant to the applications and theory of Operational Research (OR).  
 The conference will be held at the beautiful and easily accessible Conference Centre Aston in Birmingham and will showcase activities from across all areas of OR. We welcome contributions that are empirically motivated and with a focus on application, as well as those that are theoretically driven. The conference will host plenaries from leading international experts, sessions of themed talks, as well as poster sessions, and will provide plenty of opportunities for networking. We look forward to seeing you in Birmingham in April 2025 for a terrific event and to celebrate together the successes of OR!  
 EDI   
  The IMA, the OR Society, and the conference committee strongly support diversity and inclusion. It is our intention to host a conference that is welcoming and inclusive for all, and we will be making active efforts to support the participation of individuals and groups who are under-represented at such academic events and in our discipline more broadly.  
  As part of improving understanding amongst the OR community of the different barriers individuals face, we would like to invite session leaders and individual speakers to include as part of their presentation(s) their own experiences of achievement, inclusion, and exclusion. This will be complemented with a number of focused sessions with key speakers on the particular challenges faced by different groups.  
  A pack for delegates will include details on the venue’s accessibility, baby changing facilities and the nearby Martin Luther King multi-faith prayer centre. We will also include information to signpost details on local creches, transport links, and other local amenities. We also welcome special requests and suggestions, and will accommodate them where possible.  
 Call for session organisation  
 We welcome suggestions for the organisation of sessions in all areas of OR. If you are interested in organising a session, then please fill out this form  .  
 Deadline for submissions is the 6th December.
