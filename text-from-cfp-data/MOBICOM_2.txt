  MobiCom 2025 -The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking  
 Send this CFP to us by mail: cfp@ourglocal.org  
 Introduction  : Conceived in early 1995, ACM SIGMOBILE started as an organization that fosters research in the field of mobility and tetherless ubiquitous connectivity. In early 1997, we had 21 members and were a relatively unknown organization. Since then, we have grown both in size and stature, with members who span the entire world. Our members work in academia, industry, and government. They are students, teachers, practioners, policy makers, and scientists. Our organization boasts one of the most remarkable retention rates among all ACM SIGs.  
  
 The single identifying characteristic of our members is that we are a very passionate bunch. We believe we are changing the world, and we are. Our interests range from building commercially viable handheld devices with powerful communications and computing ability, to lightweight wearables that are part of a soldier's battle gear, connecting him to the rest of his platoon or division. We are interested in providing computing and Internet access in automobiles, trains, ships, planes, and spacecraft. We build satellites that connect to each other and to the Internet. We work on problems related to connectivity and functionality of millions of sensors, which we believe will become pervasive. We are interested in personal and body-area networks. Most of all, we are interested in enabling the reliable flows of useful bits in the air, the computing power in your hand, and anywhere and anytime ubiquitous communications.
