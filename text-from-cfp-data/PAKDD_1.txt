 Call for Papers – Main Track  
 PAKDD 2025 will be held exclusively in person. All accepted presentations must be delivered on-site.  
 The 29th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) will take place in Sydney, Australia, on June 10-13, 2025. PAKDD 2025 is soliciting contributed technical papers for presentation at the Conference and publication in the Conference Proceedings by Springer. We solicit novel, high-quality, and original research papers that provide innovative insights into all facets of knowledge discovery and data science, including but not limited to theoretical foundations of mining, inference, and learning, big data technologies, as well as security, privacy, and integrity. We also encourage visionary papers on emerging topics and application-based papers offering innovative technical advancements to interdisciplinary research and applications of data science.
