 IJCNN is the premier international conference in the area of neural networks theory, analysis and applications. Since its inception, IJCNN has been playing a leading role in promoting and facilitating interaction among researchers and practitioners, and dissemination of knowledge in neural networks and related facets of machine learning. And Rome with its history and geographical position will further contribute to grow and maintain the role of the IJCNN as a prominent platform for exchange of knowledge in neural networks and artificial intelligence.   
 The technical program, including tutorials, special sessions, workshops and plenary talks, covers almost all facets of neural networks and related learning systems including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, convolutional neural networks, spiking neural networks, cognitive algorithms, and deep learning along with a wide spectrum of applications. A special track is also included dedicated to the conference theme on “Human-AI interaction in creative arts and sciences”.   
 Prospective authors are invited to submit complete papers of no more than eight (8) pages in the IEEE two-column conference proceedings format, according to the  Paper Submission Guidelines    . All the accepted and presented papers will be published on IEEE Xplore Digital Library and indexed by Scopus.   
 Whether you are presenting your latest work, learning from experts, or networking with peers, IJCNN 2025 promises to be an unforgettable experience that will inspire and propel the AI and neural network community forward. We look forward to welcoming you in Rome!

 Virtual Participation  
 IJCNN 2025 will offer the option for authors to present their work remotely if necessary. If you plan to present remotely, you must clearly indicate this when registering for the conference by the deadline of May 1, 2025. Remote presenters are required to submit a pre-recorded video of their presentation, which will be made available on demand to conference attendees. Please note, there will be no live presentations for remote participants.  
 IJCNN 2025 is not a hybrid conference, and we will not be recording any live presentations. Additionally, if you are presenting remotely and will not be attending in person, you will not have access to live presentations or in-person events.  
 Please be aware that no changes to your presentation format will be accepted after the strict deadline of May 1, 2025.  

 Guidance for IEEE Publications Regarding AI-Generated Text  
 The IEEE Publication Services and Products Board has recently passed the following motion (“The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.”). Please check the “Guidance for IEEE Publications Regarding AI-Generated Text” in the MCE newsletter  .
