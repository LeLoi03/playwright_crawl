 About SMI  
 Shape Modeling International (SMI 2025)  provides an international forum for the dissemination of new mathematical theories and computational techniques for modeling, simulating and processing digital representations of shapes and their properties to a community of researchers, developers, students, and practitioners across a wide range of fields. Conference proceedings will be published in a Special Issue of Computers & Graphics Journal Elsevier  . Papers presenting original research are being sought in all areas of shape modeling and its applications.  
 SMI also participates in the Replicability Stamp Initiative  , an additional recognition for authors who are willing to go one step further, and in addition to publishing the paper, provide a complete open-source implementation. The Replicability Stamp  is a prerequisite for SMI best paper nomination. More information on topics, submission guidelines, and important dates are given below.  
 When and Where  
 SMI 2025 will be co-located with Solid and Physical Modeling (SPM) 2025  . The joint conference will take place from October 29 to November 2, 2025, in Hangzhou  , Zhejiang, P.R. China.

  Submission  
 Submissions should be anonymous via easychair  , previously unpublished, original results that are not simultaneously submitted elsewhere.  
 Submissions should be formatted according to the style guidelines for the Computers &Graphics Journal and should not exceed 12 pages, including figures and references. We strongly recommend using the LaTeX template  to format your paper. We also accept papers formatted by MS Word according to the style guidelines for Computers & Graphics. The file must be exported to a pdf file for the first round of submission. For format details, please refer to Computers & Graphics Guide for Authors  . The SMI 2025 conference will use a double-blind review process. The submission link will be available soon.  
 Submit your paper here!     
 Any accepted paper is required to have at least one registered author to attend and present the paper at the conference. As the Replicability Stamp is a prerequisite for SMI best paper nomination, please consider participates in the Replicability Stamp Initiative  if your paper gets accepted.   

 Call For Nominations:  
  Tosiyasu L. Kuni Distinguished Researcher Award  
 Shape Modeling International Awards Committee is seeking proposals to nominate the shape modeling researchers with distinguished careers for the Tosiyasu L. Kuni Distinguished Researcher Award.
