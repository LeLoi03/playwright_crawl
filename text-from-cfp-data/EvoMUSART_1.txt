 Event Details   

 The 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Music, Sound, Art and Design (EvoMUSART) will take place on 23-25 April 2025, as part of the Evo* event.  
   
 EvoMUSART webpage: www.evostar.org/2025/evomusart/   
 Submission deadline:  1 November 2024  
 Conference:  23-25 April 2024  
  
  EvoMUSART is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers who are working on the application of Artificial Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computation, Swarm Intelligence, Cellular Automata, Alife, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques in creative and artistic fields such as Visual Art, Music, Architecture, Video, Digital Games, Poetry, or Design. This conference gives researchers in the field the opportunity to promote, present and discuss ongoing work in the area.  
 Submissions must be at most 14 pages long, excluding references, in Springer LNCS format. Each submission must be anonymised for a double-blind review process.  
 Accepted papers will be presented orally or as posters at the event and included in the EvoMUSART proceedings published by Springer Nature in a dedicated volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  
 Indicative topics include but are not limited to:  
 Systems that create drawings, images, animations, sculptures, poetry, text, designs, webpages, buildings, etc.; 
  Systems that create musical pieces, sounds, instruments, voices, sound effects, sound analysis, etc.; 
  Systems that create artefacts such as game content, architecture, furniture, based on aesthetic and functional criteria; 
  Robotic-based Evolutionary Art and Music; 
  Other related artificial or generative techniques in the fields of Computer Music, Computer Art, etc. 
  Techniques for automatic fitness assignment; 
  Systems in which an analysis or interpretation of the artworks is used in conjunction with artificial intelligence techniques to produce novel objects; 
  Systems that resort to artificial intelligence approaches to perform the analysis of image, music, sound, sculpture, or some other types of artistic object or resource. 
  Systems in which artificial intelligence is used to promote the creativity of a human user; 
  New ways of integrating the user in the evolutionary cycle; 
  Analysis and evaluation of: the artistic potential of biologically inspired art and music; the artistic processes inherent to these approaches; the resulting artefacts; 
  Collaborative distributed artificial art environments; 
  Contextualisation of creative AI in cultural, economic, social, political or ecological discourse; 
  Computational Aesthetics, Experimental Aesthetics; Emotional Response, Surprise, Novelty; 
  Representation techniques; 
  Surveys of the current state-of-the-art in the area; identification of weaknesses and strengths; comparative analysis and classification; 
  Validation methodologies; 
  Studies on the applicability of these techniques to related areas; 
  New models designed to promote the creative potential of biologically inspired computation.
