  Learning Analytics for Transition, Disruption and Social Change  

 Society for Learning Analytics Research  
 The Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) is an interdisciplinary network of leading international researchers who are exploring the role and impact of analytics on teaching, learning, training and development.  

 About the University of California  
 The University of California, Irvine is a driving force of innovation and discovery in educational technology and learning analytics. UCI is ranked in the top 10 of public institutions in the United States (currently number 7). Further, as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), hosting LAK with UCI will afford broader access to students and faculty that are currently under-represented within the LAK community. Such opportunities to ensure diversity in the LAK conference will benefit the Society for many years to come.

 LAK22 Moves Online  
 We had sincerely hoped to be able to host a face to face event in 2022 but given the ongoing realities of the global pandemic due to the Delta COVID-19 variant there continues to be substantial uncertainty of international travel restrictions and vaccination rates/status for many countries. While for some countries restrictions have been able to be relaxed, for others restrictions are being reintroduced therefore as a diverse and global community we need to take into account the situations of all members when planning an international event that involves many months of preparation. Thank you to all the participants who responded to the survey and have raised their issues and concerns with us. Thus the Society for Learning Analytics Research and LAK22 organizers have made the difficult decision to host LAK22 fully online.  We would like to acknowledge and thank the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Spa for working with us during these challenging times and we hope to host a face to face LAK there sometime in the future. Please visit the News page to read our full announcement  .  

   Why You Should Join Us at LAK and Beyond!  
 The Society for Learning Analytics Research is celebrating 12 years of LAK conferences in 2022! The field continues to grow year over year. LAK21 was our largest conference of almost 600 attendees from around the world. Take a peek at why we think you should submit to LAK conferences, attend LAK or LASI, join our mailing list and better yet become a SoLAR Member! At SoLAR, our overall mission continues to be to grow the field of learning analytics globally. Join us in this mission today and we hope to see you at an event soon!
