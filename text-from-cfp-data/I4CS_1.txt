 Quantum annealing for nearest neighbour compliance problem    
   
 Article    
 Full-text available    
 Oct 2024 

 Sven Müller 
  Frank Phillipson 
    
 Quantum Computing has emerged as a promising alternative, utilising quantum mechanics for faster computations. This paper explores the nearest neighbour compliance (NNC) Problem in Gate-based Quantum Computers, where quantum gates are constrained to operate on physically adjacent qubits. The NNC problem aims to optimise the insertion of SWAP-gates...

 In this study, the portfolio optimization problem is explored, using a combination of classical and quantum computing techniques. The portfolio optimization problem with specific objectives or constraints is often a quadratic optimization problem, due to the quadratic nature of, for example, risk measures. Quantum computing is a promising solution...

 The \(k\)-medoids problem is an important problem in data clustering, which aims to partition a set of data points into \(k\) clusters, where each cluster is represented by a medoid, i.e., a data point that is the most centrally located in the cluster. Quantum annealing might be helpful in finding the solution to this problem faster. In this paper...

 One of the first fields where quantum computing will likely show its use is optimisation. Many optimisation problems naturally arise in a quadratic manner, such as the quadratic knapsack problem. The current state of quantum computers requires these problems to be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation problem, or QUBO. Constra...

 In logistic problems, an Integral Multi-Commodity Network Design Problem on a time-space network is often used to model the problem of routing transportation means and assigning freight units to those means. In Physical Internet and Synchromodal networks an interactive planning approach is preferable, meaning that calculation times of a single plan...

 In this paper an online optimisation approach is proposed which can be used to find an appropriate combined schedule and container assignment in a Network Design Problem under uncertainty. For this, a simulation based approach on a multi-period time window is proposed , moving forward on the time window after each decision made, assuming that the s...

 Offering time windows to receivers of last-mile delivery is becoming a distinguishing factor. However, we see that in practice carriers have to create routes for their vehicles based on destination information, that is just being revealed when a parcel arrives in the depot. The parcel has to be assigned directly to a vehicle, making this a Dynamic...
