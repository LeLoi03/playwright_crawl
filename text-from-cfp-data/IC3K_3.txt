 CFP for AMCIS2025 ‚ÄúSustainable Digital and Data Ecosystems ‚Äì Navigating the Age of AI‚Äù mini-track  
 December 4, 2024  December 4, 2024    Anastasija Nikiforova      

 The Association for Information Systems (AIS) organized America‚Äôs Conference on Information Systems is coming! This year it will be held in Montreal (Canada), running under the general theme of ‚Äú Intelligent technologies for a better future  ‚Äù and the revised list of (mini-)tracks, where the special attention I invite you to draw to is a new ‚ÄúSustainable Digital and Data Ecosystems ‚Äì Navigating the Age of AI‚Äù  mini-track (chairs: Anastasija Nikiforova, Daniel Staegemann, George Marakas, Martin Lnenicka).  
   
 In an increasingly data-driven world, well-designed and managed digital and data ecosystems are critical to strategic innovation and competitive advantage. With the rise of new data architectures, the shift from centralized to decentralized systems, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in data management, these ecosystems are becoming more dynamic, interconnected, and complex.  
 The growing importance of emerging data architectures such as data lakehouses and data meshes coupled with the emerging technologies of AI, blockchain, cloud computing to name a few, requires us to rethink how we manage, govern, and secure data across these ecosystems. Moreover, AI is no longer a mere component but an active agent/actor in these ecosystems, transforming processes such as data governance, data quality management, and security. Simultaneously, there is a pressing need to address how these systems can remain resilient and sustainable in the face of technological disruption and societal challenges, and how interdisciplinary approaches can provide new insights into managing these digital environments.  
 This mini-track seeks to explore the evolving nature of these ecosystems and their role in fostering sustainable, resilient, and innovative digital environments.  
 We encourage research from an ecosystem perspective (grounded in systems theory) that takes a holistic view, as well as more focused studies on specific components such as policies, strategies, interfaces, methodologies, or technologies. Special attention will be paid to the ongoing evolution of these ecosystems, especially their capacity to remain trustworthy, sustainable, and resilient over time.  
 Potential topics include but are not limited to:  
 data management and governance in emerging data architectures (data lakehouse, data mesh, etc.), including data governance, data quality management, and security; 
  the role of AI in data management, including AI-augmented governance, data quality management, and security; 
  AI-driven resilience and sustainability in digital and data ecosystems, incl. AI-augmentation of data lifecycle- and business- processes; 
  conceptualization and evolution of digital and data ecosystem components and their interrelationships; 
  emerging technologies, such as blockchain, cloud computing, sensors etc., shaping the strategic development of digital and data ecosystems; 
  case studies on the transition from centralized (data warehouse, data lake, data lakehouse) to decentralized data architectures (e.g., data mesh); 
  human/user factors in digital and data ecosystems (acceptance, interactions, participation etc.); 
  empirical studies on the sustainability, trustworthiness, and resilience of digital ecosystems | ; 
  methodologies and strategies for managing evolving digital ecosystems in different sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare, government / public sector, education). 
  interdisciplinary approaches to building, managing, and sustaining digital and data ecosystems. 
  The research and innovation in digital and data ecosystems requires an interdisciplinary approach. Therefore, this track invites papers from various disciplines such as information systems, computer science, management science, data science, decision science, organizational design, policy making, complexity, and behavioral economics, and social science to continue the problematization exploration of concepts, theories, models, and tools for building, managing and sustaining ecosystems. These can be conceptual, design science research, empirical studies, industry and government case studies, and theoretical papers, including literature reviews.  
 As such, this mini-track will serve as a platform for interdisciplinary dialogue on the critical role of sustainable digital and data ecosystems in driving strategic innovation and competitive advantage. We invite researchers and practitioners alike to share their insights, theoretical perspectives, and empirical findings in this rapidly evolving domain.  
  
 This mini-track is part of ‚ÄúStrategic & Competitive Uses of Information and Digital Technologies (SCUIDT)‚Äù track (chairs: Jack Becker, Russell Torres, Parisa Aasi, Vess Johnson).  
 For more information, see AMCIS2025 website  (for this (min-)track, navigate to ‚ÄúStrategic & Competitive Uses of Information and Digital Technologies (SCUIDT)‚Äù track).  
 Is your research related to any of the above topics? Then do not wait ‚Äì submit! üìÖüìÖüìÖ  Submissions are due February 28, 2025  .
