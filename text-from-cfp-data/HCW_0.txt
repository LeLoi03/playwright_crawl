 HCW 2025 Call for Papers  
 Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop  
 June 4, 2025  
  Milan, Italy  
 In conjunction with the 39 th  IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium ( IPDPS 2025  )  
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society  
  through the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP)  
 Most modern computing systems are heterogeneous  , either for organic reasons  because components grew independently, as it is the case in desktop grids, or by design  to leverage the strength of specific hardware, as it is the case in accelerated systems. In any case, all computing systems have some form of hardware or software heterogeneity   that must be managed, leveraged, understood, and exploited. The Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop (HCW) is a venue to discuss and innovate in all theoretical and practical aspects of heterogeneous computing: design, programmability, efficient utilization, algorithms, modeling, applications, etc. HCW 2025 will be the thirty-fourth annual gathering of this workshop.  
 The Call for Papers will be available mid-December.  
 Workshop Organization
