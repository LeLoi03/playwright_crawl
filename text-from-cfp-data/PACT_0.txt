 The 10th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT'01), was held in the Barcelona Hilton Hotel. PACT'01 offered a high quality technical program, including three outstanding keynote speakers (Randall D. Isaac, IBM; Justin Rattner and Joel Emer, both from Intel), 26 cutting-edge research papers, and a special session on Work in Progress. It also included workshops on OpenMP, Binary Translation, Memory Access Decoupled Architectures, Compilers and Operating Systems for Low Power, and Ubiquitous Computing. A tutorial on the IBM Research JalapeÃ±o JVM was also included in the technical program.   
 211 delegates attended PACT'01 and its workshops. Out of this number, 146 registered for the main event and 65 delegates registered for "workshops/tutorials only". I would like to thank all delegates for traveling to lovely Barcelona. I hope that the city was able to transmit the charm of its people, monuments and museums.   
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee of PACT'01, I would like to thank to everybody who collaborated in its making.  The conference received some funding for student travel grants through generous corporate sponsorship. The hosting university (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya UPC), public institutions and corporations (also provided funds to sponsor the activities of the conference. We gratefully thank them for their generous support.
