  CALL FOR PAPERS  
  
 IMPORTANT NOTE  
 WoWMoM 2024 will adopt a double-blind review process. Refer to the details under Paper Submission for the requirements to double-blind submissions.  
 SCOPE AND OVERVIEW  
 IEEE WoWMoM 2024 is soliciting original and previously unpublished papers addressing research challenges and advances in the areas of wireless, mobile, and multimedia networking as well as ubiquitous and pervasive systems and applications. Wireless networking technologies are continuously evolving and have become a critical part of modern life, be it for communication services, media distribution, or sensing and actuation services within the Internet of Things (IoT). Appropriate resource management, application design, and architectural networking paradigms are necessary to provide users with high quality experience in multimedia communication and services. Edge computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming essential tools to cope with the increasing diversity of connected devices and the plethora of new data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications. At the same time, the interoperability among IoT environments (including wearable computing and sensors), the network edge, and the cloud are evolving towards an IoT-edge-cloud continuum that is expected to support a wide range of application domains and services in a seamless and efficient manner. In this context, providing rich sets of measurements for characterizing and understanding the behavior of such complex systems is of paramount importance.  
 IEEE WoWMoM 2024 takes a broad view and seeks papers describing innovative research contributions to the field of mobile and wireless networking and applications. We solicit papers that present original work, validated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. We also welcome practical experiences and experimental efforts from both industry and academia, duly documenting the lessons learned from testbeds, field trials, or real deployments.

 PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION  
 Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, previously unpublished work not currently under review by another conference, workshop, or journal. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Specifically, the authors should not identify themselves in any content within the paper either directly or indirectly (e.g., through references). Where relevant, authors must refer to their previous work in the third person write as if it was written by a third party. However, authors should ensure that any anonymization of their work is not destructive. For instance, omission of references to papers just because they are the authors' previous work should be avoided, as this could prevent reviewers from finding that related paper for the purpose of the review. Submissions violating anonymization rules will not be considered for review.  
 Although submission is double-blind, non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to the rejection of your paper. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints before completing a first read of your paper, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.  
 Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all submissions must be made electronically through EDAS. Click here  to register your paper now!  
 Authors can submit regular or work-in-progress papers (appropriate category to be selected upon submission).  
  
 REGULAR PAPERS  
 Regular papers submissions may be up to 10 pages in length (including figures and references), formatted in two-column IEEE conference style with font size 10 points or greater. See IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings.   
 WORK IN PROGRESS PAPERS  
 WIP (Work-in-progress) papers provide a peer-reviewed forum for late-breaking or preliminary research results, giving an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present and demonstrate their recent research and obtain feedback from their peers in a poster session. Work-in-progress papers submissions may be up to 4 pages in length (including figures and references) and must have the prefix "WIP:" in the paper's title.  
 IMPORTANT DATES:  
 Papers due: | December 1, 2023 | December 17, 2023 
  Acceptance notification: February 19, 2024 
  Camera-ready version due: April 14, 2024 
  ACCEPTED PAPERS  
 An author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate. The paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference. Exceptions can be granted if compelling reasons are sent to the TPC Co-Chairs with a written request indicating an adequate substitute presenter before the conference. Accepted papers (both regular and WIP) will be included in the proceedings of IEEE WoWMoM 2024 which will be published through the IEEE Xplore digital library.  
 All conference proceedings must meet IEEE's quality standards, and IEEE reserves the right not to publish any proceedings that do not meet these standards. Furthermore, IEEE reserves the right to remove papers from IEEE Xplore that are not presented at the conference, for unjustified reasons.  
 BEST PAPER AWARD  
 All accepted regular papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award. A committee will select three best paper candidates based on the reviews received and also the quality of presentation. The winner will be announced during the conference. For any additional information, please contact the PC Co-chairs.
