  MDAI 2025 -International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence  
 Send this CFP to us by mail: cfp@ourglocal.org  
 Introduction  : The aim of the MDAI conference series is to provide a forum for researchers to discuss models for decision and information fusion (aggregation operators) and their applications to AI.  
  
 Proceedings with accepted papers are expected to be published in the LNAI/LNCS series (Springer-Verlag) and distributed at the conference, as done in previous conferences.  
  
 Besides, papers, that according to the evaluation of the referees, are not suitable for the LNAI but that have some merits will be published in a CD-ROM proceedings (with ISBN) and scheduled in the MDAI program.  
 Deadline  : TBD | Date  : TBD
