 We are seeking organizers for future TCCs. Would you like to be one? If so, please let the steering committee know of your interest ASAP by notifying shaih AT alum DOT mit DOT edu  . It will be useful if you provide as much as possible of the following information (but this can wait for a later stage): Proposed general chair: The person organizing the conference gets this job. 
  Proposed location: city, country 
  Propose venue (university, hotel, other) 
  Proposed dates (try to avoid | Friday and Saturday | ) 
  Facilities: Is there auditorium style seating? How many persons does the room accommodate? 
  Cost: Could you roughly estimate the cost for hotel and facilities? 
  Years: Let us know whether your proposal can be carried over into future years if not selected for the next year. 
  Indeed, we will need the aforementioned information at a later stage (i.e., at the time we choose the location), but Shai will let you know of our needs for these details in due time. We typically want to make a decision for TCC N  a few months ahead of TCC N-1  . Current status  : The location of TCC'14 has been determined. Currently, the next proposal we seek is for TCC'15. If you'd like to make a proposition for TCC'15 or a later year please send Shai an initial email. Detailed proposals would be sought at a later stage.  
 Preferred dates  : Our default is to hold TCC between mid February and early March with preference to mid February. However, deviation (as per local constraints) have occurred (see history table below).
