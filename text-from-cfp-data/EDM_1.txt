 README 

 Scripts for converting paper formats  
      
 Installation  
      
 Required Python packages are specified in conda_env.yml  . The Python environment is specified using conda  , which can be obtained by installing Anaconda or Miniconda (recommended).  
 To install the environment, run:  
 conda env create -f conda_env.yml # If this gets OOM-killed, see below     
 On machines with limited RAM such as small cloud servers, the out-of-memory killer may stop the conda environment creation with a "Killed" message. If so, add swap space:  
 sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile sudo chmod 600 /swapfile sudo mkswap /swapfile sudo swapon /swapfile sudo cp /etc/fstab ~  /fstab-backup echo  '  /swapfile none swap sw 0 0 '   |  sudo tee -a /etc/fstab    
 This will create a new conda environment called paper_convert  with the required packages installed.  
 LaTeX conversion requires a recent version of TexLive. TexLive 2020 and older do not properly handle subfigures, for example.  
 Checking reference styles also requires the anystyle-cli  Ruby gem to be installed, e.g., via sudo gem install anystyle-cli  .  
 Configuration  
      
 Edit config.json  to adjust the paths to required applications, including the correct Python environment and path to anystyle  .  
 messages.json  can also be used to modify the warning messages shown when something goes wrong during paper conversion.  
 Using conversion scripts  
      
 Scripts can be run via the paper-convert-www  frontend or from the command line.  
 If run from the command line, scripts must be run from the current directory. The result will be an index.html  file in the specified output folder, which may also include conversion_warnings.csv  containing a record of possible problems encountered during conversion. Additionally, there will be any images that are part of the paper.  
 Run python main_docx.py -h  to see info on DOCX => HTML conversion. The DOCX converter also produces a tmp.docx  file for some types of image conversion. tmp.docx  may be safely deleted.  
 Run python main_latex.py -h  to see info on LaTeX => HTML conversion. The LaTeX converter also produces a source  temporary directory in the output, which can be deleted, and a few tmp-*  files that can also be safely deleted.
