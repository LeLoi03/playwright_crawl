 The academic community is invited to submit papers for the upcoming International Congress on Information, Technology and Applications (ITA’25), which will convene between March and April 2025. This distinguished conference, originally known as the International Conference on Internet Trolling and Addiction, has broadened its scope to encompass a wide array of topics including business, mathematics, education, and general information technology.  
 ITA’25 will be hosted at the QV Tower in Melbourne in March and on the 4th floor of the Acacia Mall in Kampala in April, in both cases providing a hybrid format that allows for both in-person and online participation. The conference aims to bring together scholars, researchers, and practitioners from around the world to discuss the latest developments and innovations in their respective fields.  
 Academics and researchers are encouraged to submit an abstract for their paper by emailing [email protected]   and [email protected]   by 15 November 2024.  
 Prominent keynote speakers for the event include Jonathan Bishop and Nakimuli Rita Kizza. Attendees can also look forward to special features such as an excursion to the Source of the Nile and a Gala Dinner at Le Chateau in Uganda or a trip aboard The Spirit of Melbourne in Australia.
