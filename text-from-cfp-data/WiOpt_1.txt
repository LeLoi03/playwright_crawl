 The 23st International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad hoc, and Wireless Networks solicits high-quality contributions. WiOpt 2025 aims to bring together state-of-the-art research contributions from different fields in networks. It welcomes original and high-quality submissions related to modeling, performance evaluation and optimization of networks. The focus includes mobile networks, social networks, vehicular networks, content-driven networks, cloud and edge computing systems, Internet of Things, etc. We encourage both theoretical contributions and real world empirical measurements and experimental studies.  
 The areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Modeling, model validation and performance analysis 
  Cross-layer design and optimization / control 
  Scaling laws and fundamental limits 
  Network architectures and protocol design 
  Resource allocation and management 
  Network economics and pricing 
  Game theory for networks 
  Quality of service solutions 
  Energy efficiency, harvesting, power control and management 
  Security, trust, and privacy 
  Network resilience, anomaly detection, and reliability analysis 
  Data collection and analytics for networks 
  Edge and Fog computing 
  Mobile and Cloud computing 
  Content distribution networks and wireless caching 
  Reflective intelligent surface for communication networks 
  Machine learning techniques for wireless communications and networking 
  UAV communications in 5G and Beyond Networks 
  Integrated sensing and communication 
  Human-centric communication and networking for Metaverse 
  WiOpt 2025 will give one Best Paper Award and one Best Student Paper Award. For the Best Student Paper Award, the first author of the paper needs to be a full-time student at the time of paper submission.  
 The copyright of published papers belongs to IFIP, which implements a free open access policy: authors effectively hold the copyright of their papers, and IFIP automatically grants authors permissions to reuse the material as they wish.
