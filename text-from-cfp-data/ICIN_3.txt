 Call For Papers   
 (Click here to download CFP in PDF format)    
 ICIN 2022 solicits original, unpublished work not currently under review by other conferences or journals. Papers submitted to ICIN 2022 will be assessed based on originality, technical soundness, clarity and interest to a wide audience.  
  All submissions must be written in English and must use standard IEEE two-column conference template, available for download from the IEEE website: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html   
 Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process and all submissions must be done electronically through EDAS using the following link: https://edas.info/N28598   
 Technical papers can be of two types: full papers or short papers, up to 8 pages and 5 pages respectively, including tables, figures and references. We also call for demo papers of 3 pages long.   
  At least one author is required to register, at the full rate, to present accepted papers at the conference and for the paper to appear in the conference proceedings.  
 ICIN 2022 is technically co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE ComSoc and ACM SIGMOBILE In cooperation | All accepted & presented papers will be published in IEEE Xplore. 
  The best technical papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an extended version for fast-track review in IEEE Transactions on Network Service and Management (Impact Factor: 4.682) 
  Extended versions of ICIN 2022 papers must include at least 30% of new material (algorithms, results, related work) compared to the conference version. 
  Particularly innovative and visionary papers will be invited to submit a tutorial-style, magazine version for fast-track review in IEEE Communications Magazine (Impact Factor: 10.356). 
  Areas of interest and topics include, but are not limited to:
