 2024 CALL FOR PAPERS  
 UPDATE: The extended deadline to submit paper abstracts and workshop presentation proposals is April 1, 2024   .  Abstracts submitted between March 16 and April 1 are subject to a $25 late fee payable in the ASOR Online Portal Store  . This fee may be waived by a session/workshop chair if they solicited the proposal.  
 ASOR invites members to submit paper abstracts and workshop presentation proposals for the 2024 Annual Meeting.  
 ASOR’s 2024 Annual Meeting will take place November 20–23 at the Hilton Boston Park Plaza. The November meeting will be hybrid with both in-person and virtual participation. All sessions (and workshops, when feasible) will be able to include both in-person presentations in Boston and virtual presentations online via Zoom.  
 View the list of sessions and workshops being offered before you submit an abstract.  
 2024 List of Approved Sessions & Workshops 
  Hybrid Format  
 Virtual attendees will have the ability to view and listen to in-person and virtual speakers in real time. Virtual presenters will speak in real time when presenting; if they have a PowerPoint presentation, that will be projected by the session room’s ASOR facilitator to appear on the screen in the meeting room and online via Zoom (virtual presenters will be able to advance their own slides). All presenters (in-person and virtual) are required to send in their PowerPoint file or hybrid video presentation by Wednesday, November 6  . Virtual presenters should prepare a recorded presentation in advance to be played during the session, and join via Zoom to answer questions live.  
 Please note that the meeting rooms in Boston will not be set for a fully two-way hybrid experience, meaning that there will not be a view of the room/audience or synchronous discussion between virtual and in-person attendees. Virtual attendees will need to submit their post-presentation questions via the chat feature in Zoom and the ASOR facilitator will read them to the presenter.   
 All sessions will be recorded and available online after the meeting to registered attendees and ASOR Online Library subscribers.  
 General Instructions  
 All paper proposals and workshop presentation descriptions must be submitted through ASOR’s Online Abstract Submission Form via the Abstract Center   on the ASOR Online Portal.   Please make sure your account information in the ASOR Online Portal is correct. Some of this information will auto-populate on the Online Abstract Submission Form. You will need to have a current ASOR Academic Membership and register for the 2024 ASOR Annual Meeting to gain access to the form.  
    
 If you would like to present your research in poster format, please wait until the 2024 Call for Posters opens on May 1 with a new submission form.  
 Please read the Code of Conduct for the ASOR Annual Meeting  , the Rules for Participation  and ASOR’s Policy on Professional Conduct  before submitting your abstract.  
 Important  : Please decide before submitting your abstract if, should it be accepted, you will present online via Zoom or at the meeting in Boston. There will be a required question on the abstract submission form to indicate your decision.  
 A note about Workshops  ( designated by the word “workshop” in parentheses at the end of the title  ): Workshops differ from paper sessions – some workshops may be run as panels or offer activity. If presentations are part of the workshop format, the presentation is limited to a maximum of 10 minutes and does not count as an academic paper. Prospective workshop presenters must still submit an abstract during the Call for Papers that will be peer-reviewed and serve as a description of what you plan to contribute to the workshop. You are strongly encouraged to reach out to the workshop chairs before applying if you have any questions about the format.  
 The deadline to submit paper abstracts and/or workshop presentation proposals is March 15, 2024.   
 Ready to submit your abstract?  
    
 You may submit an abstract after completing these two requirements:   
  A) You have a current ASOR Academic Membership (Graduate, Early Career, Regular, Retired, Sustaining). Join or renew in ASOR’s Online Portal  .  
  B) You have registered for the 2024 ASOR Annual Meeting. Register here.   
 Current academic members who have registered for the 2024 Annual Meeting will have access to the ASOR Online Abstract Submission Form by following these steps:  
  1. Log-in to the ASOR Online Portal   and select the “Events” drop-down menu from the top of the page. New users may need to create a free account.  
  2. Select “Browse Upcoming Events” and select the 2024 ASOR Annual Meeting from the upcoming event titles.  
  3. From the top of the 2024 Annual Meeting Event Page, select the “Abstracts” drop-down menu and go to the Abstract Center   to learn more about the submission process, or select “Submit an Abstract” if you are ready to submit your proposal.  
 FAQ’s and Helpful Tools:  You can download step-by-step instructions with pictures, watch video tutorials, and read through answers to frequently asked questions here  .   
 Submit your abstract via the Abstract Center on the ASOR Online Portal   
    
  Scholarships available:  Thanks to donations from ASOR’s generous members, current ASOR members with a need may request a 25%, 50%, or full scholarship for annual meeting registration. E-mail programs@asor.org  with requests and a brief explanation prior to purchasing meeting registration. Registration scholarships will not be awarded to individuals who have already registered for the meeting. We will strive to meet all requests from members, with a preference towards those who have not received a scholarship in the past two years. We will do our best to meet requests from non-members and past scholarship recipients.  
  Note: If it is impossible for you to renew or purchase membership and register for the Annual Meeting AND  you are a scholar from a country such as Jordan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, etc., please contact meetings@asor.org to make an exceptional circumstance request.   
 Decision Process  
 Session chairs will accept papers on the basis of the quality of the abstract and its conformity to the following guidelines regarding content and format. To be considered by session chairs, abstracts also must be submitted by the deadline, and proposers must be current ASOR members and registered for the meeting. Standards for acceptance will be the same for all abstracts submitted.  
 The abstract will be reviewed by session chairs based on the sessions/workshops that you select on the submission form. You may select a first-choice session or workshop as well as second-choice option. For further information or questions specifically related to sessions and workshops, we strongly suggest that you email the Chair(s) in advance  of the submission deadline.  
 The ASOR Office will send proposal decision notifications via e-mail by May 15. Questions regarding the online submission process or the status of a submission should be emailed to Arlene Press,  ASOR’s Director of Meetings and Events.  
 Content of Abstracts  
 The content of the abstract should focus on the significance of the material or on proposed solutions to specific problems rather than on a descriptive narrative.  
 The SIGNIFICANCE of the author’s work should be stated explicitly. 
  CONCLUSIONS, as well as the evidence for them, should be presented clearly. 
  The TITLE should be precise and give sufficient information to allow for bibliographic indexing. 
  Bibliographic references should be avoided (if possible) in the abstract and count towards the 250 word limit. PREVIOUS SCHOLARSHIP on the subject may be cited, if particularly relevant as a point of departure for clarifying the advances made in the author’s own work. See below for bibliographic format. 
  It is understood that excavators and others engaged in field research during the summer cannot provide conclusions by the March 15 deadline. Preliminary submission for reports on excavations and surveys, however, is required; submissions should be detailed and specific and should include information on the precise objective of the project and its research design. 
  Format of Abstracts  
 Abstracts should not exceed | 250 words | . 
  In the case of multiple authors, please make sure to indicate which author will present (read) the paper at the Annual Meeting when submitting the abstract. Each member may submit only ONE paper for which he/she/they is the reader. 
  Abstract submissions MUST list ALL co-authors in the fields provided on the abstract submission form at the time of submission and by the March 15 deadline. 
  All abstracts should follow the directives of | The Chicago Manual of Style | (17th edition; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2017). 
  If bibliographic references are included, these must follow the | BASOR  style | , updated 23 January 2017, reference 32-33. 
  There is no place for the addition of key words in the abstract submission form. It is recommended not to use key words as part of the 250 word maximum abstract as they are not part of the search or hyperlink features of the online program. 
  Publication of Abstracts  
 All accepted abstracts for papers, posters, and workshop presentations will be published either online, in print, or both. 
  By submitting an abstract, presenters authorize ASOR to publish that abstract online and/or in print. 
  Presenters should make certain that abstracts are formatted and worded properly upon submission; opportunities for editing abstracts after the program has posted may not be possible. 
  Abstracts may be reviewed and lightly copy-edited for grammar and consistency of style. 
  All submissions must be made electronically via the Abstract Center on the ASOR Online Portal
