 Call for papers  

  2025 The 8th International Conference on Machine Vision and Applications (ICMVA 2025) will be held in Melbourne, Australia during June 12-14, 2025  . This conference provides opportunities for the different areas delegates to exchange new ideas and application experiences face to face, to establish business or research relations and to find global partners for future collaboration. We hope that the conference results constituted significant contribution to the knowledge in these up to date scientific field. The organizing committee of conference is pleased to invite prospective authors to submit their original manuscripts to ICMVA 2025.  
   
  The conference will bring together leading researchers, engineers and scientists in the domain of interest from around the world. Topics of interest for submission include, but are not limited to:  
 Computer Vision  (scene reconstruction, video tracking, 3D pose estimation, action recognition,…)  
   
  Active Vision  (autonomous cameras, wearable and assistive computing, real-time 3D scene segmentation and reconstruction,…)  
   
  3D-Vision  (stereovision, laser triangulation, multi-cameras,…)
