 We invite three types of submissions: full research papers, short communications, and doctoral papers. All papers must be submitted in PDF format and comply with the following guidelines:  
 Full research papers  (14-16 pages) present theoretical, methodological or conceptual solutions, empirical studies, or new research positions and approaches. Submissions must conform to Springer LNCS format and should not exceed 16 pages, including all text, figures, references, and appendices. See the guidelines here: https://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html  .  
 Short communications  (8-10 pages) present experience reports, project overviews, or preliminary research ideas. Submissions must conform to CEURART 1-column format and should not exceed 10 pages including all text, figures, references, and appendices. Information about the CEURART format can be found at https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html  (Scroll to section: “CEURART style files for papers”).  
 Doctoral student papers  (8-10 pages) present the progress of a doctoral research project. They will be presented during the Doctoral Consortium to be held on June 30, 2024. Submissions must conform to CEURART 1-column format (see the instructions above) and must be single-authored (PhD student only). The supervisor should be mentioned in the Acknowledgment section. The papers should cover the following topics:  
 introduce the field of research, 
  clearly formulate the research questions and objectives, 
  outline the state of the art of the domain, 
  sketch the research methodology, 
  introduce the proposed contribution, 
  indicate the issues still to be resolved and describe the next steps that are planned. 
  All submissions must describe original contributions, unpublished and not under review elsewhere. Submissions not conforming to the format, exceeding the page limit, or being obviously out of the scope of the conference, will be rejected without review.  
 All submissions will be evaluated (originality, validity, contribution, technical quality, and presentation) by at least three members of the international programme committee.  
 Full research papers will be published by Springer in the series Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS), indexed by SCOPUS and submitted for indexation in Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index. Extended versions of selected papers will be invited for submission to the following journals indexed by Clarivate Analytics Web of Science and Scopus: Informatica, Computer Science and Information Systems, Baltic Journal of Modern Computing.  
 Short communications and doctoral papers will be submitted for online publication as CEUR Workshop proceedings. Best selected short papers will be published by Springer CCIS.
