 Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC) have evolved into an active area of research and development. This is due to the tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics, including wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, RFID technology, and the ubiquitous mobile phone. MobiSPC-2024 solicits papers that focus on the theory, systems, practices and challenges of providing users with a successful mobile or wireless experience. This includes how mobile computing changes how people pervasively use their computers, computing resources and applications, as well the systems, services and technology enabling those applications.  
 MobiSPC 2024 will provide a leading edge, scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the art research and developmental work in the broad areas of pervasive computing and communications.  
 MobiSPC 2024 will be held in Marshall University, Huntington, West Virginia, USA. Huntington, WV, is strategically located at the heart of the Tri-State area, which encompasses parts of West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky. This central location makes it a convenient meeting point for conference attendees from across these states and beyond. Conference attendees have the advantage of easy access to multiple airports, ensuring a smooth journey to Huntington.
