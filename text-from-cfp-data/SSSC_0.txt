 PaperCept  

 Info      

 The PaperCept Conference Manuscript Management System is used by IFAC to manage paper submissions to all IFAC events. Every participant in a conference is served by the site. The system allows users to:  
 submit their contributions to any event of their choice, 
  inspect the reviews and final decision letter of the submission, 
  resubmit the final version of a submission, and 
  upload comments if the user acts as a reviewer.
