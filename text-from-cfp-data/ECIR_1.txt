 Call for Full Papers  

 Call for Full Papers   
 The European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is the prime European forum for the presentation of original research in the field of Information Retrieval.   
 Topics of Interest   
 ECIR 2025 invites the submission of high-quality and original papers in the broad field of Information Retrieval – this primarily includes textual or textual with multimodal information. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:   
 Search and ranking, | including retrieval models and ranking, query and content analysis, web search, and theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval; 
  User aspects in IR | , including information interaction, contextualisation, personalisation, simulation, characterisation, and behaviours; 
  System aspects | , including retrieval and recommendation architectures, efficiency and scalability; 
  Conversational search and recommender systems | , focusing on natural language understanding and generation, dialogue management, multimodal interaction, and user engagement in search processes; 
  Explainability methods | , addressing the transparency, interpretability, and accountability of AI-driven systems, particularly for information retrieval, recommendation, and personalisation; 
  Machine Learning and Large Language Models | for information retrieval and recommendation; 
  Applications | , such as web search, recommender systems, web and social media apps, professional and domain-specific search, novel interfaces to search tools, intelligent search, and conversational agents; 
  Evaluation research | , including new metrics and novel methods for the measurement and evaluation of retrieval and/or recommendation systems, users, and/or applications; 
  New social and technical challenges in IR | , such as bias, ethics, fake news, and hate speech, IR-focused trustworthy & explainable AI methodologies and techniques. 
  Full Paper Track   
 The Full Paper Track provides the opportunity for researchers to present their state-of-the-art research in Information Retrieval, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.   
 Full papers are up to | 12 pages in length | plus additional pages for references. Appendices count toward the page limit. Please put appendices | before | the references for paper submission. 
  Full papers will be refereed through | double-blind peer review | , with an initial first-stage review followed by a second stage of discussion led by a meta-reviewer. 
  Submission Guidelines   
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word (to be found at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines   ), for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers (  https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid   ).   
 All submissions must be written in English. All papers should be submitted electronically through the EasyChair submission system (  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecir2025   )   
 In addition, the corresponding author of each accepted paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the paper has been submitted, changes relating to its authorship cannot be made.   
 Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The proceedings will be distributed to all delegates at the conference. Accepted papers will have to be presented at the conference by one of the authors in person – and at least one author for each accepted contribution will be required to register and attend.   
 Dual Submission Policy   
 Papers submitted to ECIR 2025 should be substantially different from papers that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that are under review at other venues. Exceptions to this rule are:   
 Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings. 
  Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report (e.g., in institutional archives or preprint archives like arXiv). However, we discourage this since it places anonymity at risk; in particular, please do not publish your paper at arXiv and submit it to ECIR at the same time, some days before, or during the reviewing period of ECIR. If your paper already is available as a technical report, you might not want to use the exact same title and abstract for your ECIR submission (in case of acceptance at ECIR, the title of your submission still might be changed back). 
  Please do not cite your technical report and make some effort to avoid any issues that may harm the double-blindness of your submission. Reviewers will receive guidance that ask them to refrain from trying to break blindness if at all possible too, but be aware that the availability of an available technical report for an ECIR submission can cause issues. 
  Ethics and Professional Conduct   
 ECIR 2025 expects authors (as well as the PC, and the organising committee) to adhere to accepted standards on ethics and professionalism in our community, namely:   
 The | ACM’s Policy on Authorship | , 
  The | ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct | , 
  The | ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification | , 
  The | ACM’s Policy Against Harassment | .
