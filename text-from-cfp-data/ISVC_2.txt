 Call for Papers  
 ISVC seeks papers describing contributions to the state of the art and practice in the broad field of visual computing. The symposium is structured around the four central areas of visual computing:  
 Computer Vision 
  Computer Graphics 
  Virtual Reality 
  Visualization 
  In particular, we are interested in papers that combine technologies from two or more of these areas. In addition to the main symposium, we are soliciting papers for several special tracks related to ISVC. In submitting your paper, you should also check whether it might be a good fit for any of the special tracks  being organized this year.  
 Area 1: Computer Vision  
 Computer vision, the study of enabling computers to understand and interpret visual information from static images and video sequences, is expanding rapidly throughout the world. During the past ten years, computer vision has grown from a research area to a widely accepted technology, capable of providing dramatic increase in productivity and improving living standard. We are seeking papers covering both the theory and applications of computer vision. Topics of interest include all aspects of computer vision including, but not limited, to the following areas:  
 Early and Biologically-Inspired Vision 
  Color and Texture 
  Illumination and Reflectance Modeling 
  Segmentation and Grouping 
  Object Recognition/Detection/Categorization 
  Motion and Tracking 
  Video Analysis and Event Recognition 
  Biometrics (Face, Fingerprint, Hand, Iris, etc.) 
  Pattern Recognition 
  Statistical Methods and Learning 
  Deep Learning 
  Big Data 
  Document Analysis 
  Medical Image Analysis 
  Image and Video Retrieval 
  3D Reconstruction 
  Shape from X 
  Physics-Based Modeling 
  Image-Based Modeling 
  Computational Photography 
  Human-Computer Interfaces 
  Vision for Graphics 
  Vision for Robotics 
  Sensors and Systems 
  Secure Image/Video Communication 
  Image/Video Encoding/Compression 
  Applications 
  Area 2: Computer Graphics  
 Advances and breakthroughs in computer graphics have made visual media the basis of the modern user interface. It is clear that graphics will play a dominant role in the way people communicate and interact with computers in the future. ISVC seeks original research and applied papers in all areas of computer graphics. Topics of interest include all aspects of computer graphics including, but not limited, to the following areas:  
 Geometric Modeling 
  Physically Based Modeling 
  Geometric Computing 
  Shape and Surface Modeling 
  Graphics Algorithms 
  Web Based Graphics 
  Perceptual Aspects of Computer Graphics 
  Computer Animation 
  Special Effects 
  Multimedia and Digital Media 
  Computational Photography 
  Image-Based Computer Graphics 
  Rendering Techniques 
  Stylized Rendering 
  Global Illumination, Photo-Realistic Computer Graphics 
  Volume Graphics, Semi-Transparent Media 
  Graphics System Architectures 
  Graphics Hardware and Hardware-Related Techniques (GPU) 
  Data Compression for Graphics 
  Computer Graphics for Small/Large Displays 
  Parallelism in Computer Graphics 
  Graphic Toolkits 
  Interaction and HCI 
  Simulation for Computer Graphics 
  Applications 
  Area 3: Virtual Reality  
 Virtual reality (VR) enables users to experience a three-dimensional environment generated using computer graphics, and perhaps other sensory modalities, to provide an environment for enhanced interaction between a human user and a computer-created world. ISVC seeks original research and applied papers in all areas of virtual reality, as well as augmented reality, mixed reality and 3D HCI. Topics of interest include all aspects of virtual reality including, but not limited, to the following areas:  
 Augmented Reality 
  Mixed Reality 
  Artificial Reality 
  Real-Time Rendering 
  Collision detection in VR 
  3D Interaction for VR 
  Modeling and Simulation 
  Virtual Humans and Artificial Life 
  VR Systems and Toolkits 
  Collaborative Virtual Environments 
  Tele-collaboration 
  VR System Architecture 
  Multimodal Displays 
  Projection and Display Systems 
  Human Computer Interaction 
  Presence and Cognition 
  Integration of VR and Multimedia 
  Immersive Gaming 
  Multi-user and Distributed VR and gaming 
  Serious Games 
  Haptics, Audio, and Other Non-Visual Interfaces 
  Tracking and Sensing 
  Human Factors 
  User Studies and Evaluation 
  Hardware Devices 
  Applications 
  Area 4: Visualization  
 The field of visualization seeks to determine and present underlying correlated structures and relationships in both scientific (computational and medical sciences) and more abstract datasets. The prime objective of the presentation should be to communicate the information in a dataset so as to enhance understanding. Topics of interest include all aspects of visualization including, but not limited, to the following areas:  
 Visualization Taxonomies and Models 
  Information Visualization 
  Scalar, Vector, and Tensor Visualization 
  Multi-dimensional and Multi-Resolution Data Visualization 
  Time Series Data Visualization 
  Medical Data Visualization 
  Molecular Data Visualization 
  Geographic Data Visualization 
  Volume Visualization 
  Flow Visualization 
  Large Scale Data Set Visualization 
  Collaborative and Distributive Visualization 
  Isosurfaces 
  Rendering Techniques 
  Visualization Systems 
  Visual Analytics, Visual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 
  Display and Interaction Technology 
  Human Perception and Cognition 
  Human Factors 
  Haptics for Visualization 
  Evaluation and User Studies 
  Hardware for Visualization 
  Mesh Techniques and Compression 
  Applications
