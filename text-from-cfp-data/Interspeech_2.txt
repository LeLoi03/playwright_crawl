 About the ISCA Archive  
 The Archive team  
 The ISCA Archive was originally assembled by Wolfgang Hess (Bonn, Germany), who has also managed it throughout most of its history; since 2016 it has been looked after and extended by Martin Cooke (Ikerbasque, Spain), recently joined by Sebastian Le Maguer (U. Helsinki, Finland).  
 Recent changes  
 [Mar 2024] added 6 laughter workshops 
  [Jan 2024] moved to isca-archive.org 
  [Jan 2024] modified metas to allow indexing by Google Scholar 
  [Sept 2023] Sebastian Le Maguer joins the archive team 
  [June 2022] fast search now covers abstracts 
  [May 2022] many conferences from the past 20 years have been added (TIPS, LISTA, ISCSLP and others) 
  [Sept 2021] added browsing/search functions, enabling users to find papers by topic/author quickly 
  [Sept 2021] support for DOIs, which are now assigned to all INTERSPEECH conferences since 2004 and many conferences post-2016, with more to come 
  [Sept 2021] introduced author-year-conference naming structure, making it easy to find papers after downloading 
  [Aug 2021] increased visibility for conferences that were somewhat hidden away in the previous archive 
  [Aug 2021] added bibtex to each abstract to ease citations 
  [Aug 2021] made archive mobile- and tablet-friendly 
  [aug 2021] resolved some inconsistencies that have crept in over the years 
  Found an error?  
 We are always interested to hear of any errors that you spot. Please note that it is not possible to modify pdfs, and any changes to authors, titles and abstracts should exactly match the content of the pdf. Errors should be reported to archives at the isca-speech main email address (not forgetting the dot org).  
 Getting papers into the archive  
 If you are organising a conference in the field of speech communication, or have organised one in the past and wish to explore placing papers in the Archive, please contact us at the archives email mentioned above.  
 Can I place a copy of my paper in an institutional or other repository?  
 Yes. For any paper published in the proceedings of INTERSPEECH or other ISCA sponsored events whose copyright is transferred to ISCA, ISCA grants each author permission to use the paper in that author's dissertation or in institutional and public repositories such as arXiv, provided that the paper is correctly cited, with DOI if available. This permission applies to all authors of the article. Authors are required to refer to the paper as specified in the ISCA Archive rather than refer to the institutional or public repository copy of the paper.  
 Copyright for papers submitted to INTERSPEECH  
 The following statement defines copyright for papers submitted to INTERSPEECH  
 By each submission of a paper to INTERSPEECH-20xx, the author(s) hereby warrant(s) that the manuscript has been submitted to ISCA (the International Speech Communication Association) for publication in the INTERSPEECH 20xx Proceedings, IS ORIGINAL AND HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION OR PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE and that all trademark use within the manuscript has been credited to its owner or written permission to use the name has been granted. In addition, the author(s) acknowledge(s) that all images such as tables, screenshots, graphics, etc., do not have a copyright that is held by a third party. The author(s) agree(s) to, and hereby assign(s) all rights, title and interest, including copyrights, in and to the manuscript to ISCA. The author(s) retain(s) the rights to any intellectual property developed by the author(s) and included in the manuscript. Note that the ISCA reviewing process is confidential. The copyright is provisionally transferred to ISCA at the time of submission of the article. This copyright is definitively assigned to ISCA if the manuscript is accepted after the reviewing process. If the manuscript is not accepted, the copyright transfer to ISCA is thus abrogated.  
   
 Can I order a print copy of the INTERSPEECH proceedings?  
 Yes, by visiting this page.
