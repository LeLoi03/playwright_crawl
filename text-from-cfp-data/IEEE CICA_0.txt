 IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.  
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia:  
 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Energy, Transport and Environmental Sustainability (IEEE CIETES) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Engineering / Cyber Physical Systems (IEEE CIES) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Image, Signal Processing and Synthetic Media (IEEE CISM) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Artificial Life and Cooperative Intelligent Systems (IEEE ALIFE-CIS) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Security, Defence and Biometrics (IEEE CISDB) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Health and Medicine (IEEE CIHM) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Financial Engineering and Economics (IEEE CiFer) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Natural Language Processing and Social Media (IEEE CI-NLPSoMe) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia on Trustworthy, Explainable and Responsible CI (IEEE CITREx) 
  2025 IEEE Symposia for Multidisciplinary Computational Intelligence Incubators (IEEE MCII) 
   
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings IEEE SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non-skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants - from fast food to Michelin star - and sport activities.  
 Late Submission Opportunities   
  IEEE SSCI 2025 offers several submission options for late-breaking research:  
 Late-Breaking Papers: | Submit an extended abstract of up to 2 pages to share preliminary research, ideas, or critiques, fostering interactive discussions. 
  Poster-Only Submissions: | Submit a short abstract (up to 250 words) to present early-stage concepts or challenges for constructive feedback. 
  Journal to Conference (J2C) Submissions: | Provide a summary (up to 1 page) of recent journal articles relevant to SSCI themes, promoting broader engagement with your research. 
  For more instructions on each kind of submission including page limitations and submission format, please see submission instructions  .  
  
 Paper Formats   
  
 Type of Paper | Description | Length | Publication Format | Presentation Format 
 Full papers | Complete papers describing your novel research in full | Up to 6 pages, plus 1 page for references. A maximum of two extra content pages per full paper is allowed (i.e, up to 8 pages plus 1 page for references), at an additional charge per extra page as specified in the registration page | To be submitted for publication in the respective symposium proceedings | Lightning talk + poster 
 Short papers | Papers with novel insights, approaches or ideas which may not have been fully tested yet | Up to 4 pages, plus 1 page for references | To be submitted for publication in the respective symposium proceedings | Poster 
 Late breaking papers | Extended abstracts with a "prequel" to provoke novel conversations for future work or ideas to emerge, or with a "sequel" to a prior research contribution, or with a discussion to alert the community of important topics that may not yet have received sufficient attention, or with an original discussion or critique of existing methodologies | Up to 2 pages, including references, if any. | For presentation at the conference but not to be included in the proceedings. The titles and author names of accepted late breaking papers will be listed in the IEEE SSCI 2025 website. Authors of accepted late breaking papers will be given the option to have their papers linked from the SSCI page under a section corresponding to the symposium if they upload their paper to a preprint repository (e.g., ArXiv) | Poster 
 Abstract (poster-only) submission | Abstracts may involve, e.g., novel insights, or new ideas which may not have been fully tested yet, or presentation of challenges posed by a given domain that could benefit from computational intelligence | Up to 250 words | For presentation at the conference but not to be included in the proceedings. The titles and author names of the accepted abstracts will be listed in the IEEE SSCI 2025 website. Abstracts may involve | Poster 
 Journal to conference (J2C) | Papers accepted at IEEE Transactions journals sponsored by CIS and first appeared in IEEEXplore within the past 2 years | Up to 1 page listing bullet points with the highlights of the paper, and an explanation on why you believe the paper to be relevant to SSCI | For presentation at the conference but not to be included in the conference proceedings. | Lightning talk + poster
