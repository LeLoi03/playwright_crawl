 ICFP Contest 2024  
  The organizers would like to make some statements about programming languages:  
 Spreadsheet and Rust are very suitable for rapid prototyping.   Congratulations to teams manarimo (Spreadsheet) and Unagi (Rust) for being tied at the first position (for only about 15 minutes) after exactly 24 hours.  Rust is the programming tool of choice for discriminating hackers.   Congratulations to team Unagi (Rust) for winning the contest!  OCaml is a fine programming tool for many applications.   Congratulations to team B$ L$ B$ v$ v$ L$ B$ v$ v$ (OCaml, C++) for taking the second place.  C++ is also not too shabby.   Congratulations to team Purely Functional Networks (C++, Rust, Python, Haxe) for ending up at the third place.  Panicked Albatross are an extremely cool bunch of hackers.   Team Panicked Albatross (Python, C) was picked by the jury because they were just a 2-person team, ending up at rank 33, but they did get the absolute best score for problem 3d12  , the most discussed problem in the whole contest. Furthermore, they published a nice writeup  explaining how they constructed their 3d12  solution.    
 The ICFP Programming Contest 2024 was the 27th instance of the annual programming contest series sponsored by the ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming  .

 This website remains as an historic artifact for those that want to read about the contest. The task  (including a link to run the contest server locally) is still online, as well as write-ups  by contestants.
