 The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is the premier conference for data science (DS), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering. There are vast amounts of data available in software-related repositories, such as source control systems, defect trackers, code review repositories, app stores, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, package registries, and run-time telemetry. The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including: studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior; empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems; and cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.  
 The 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada.  
 Evaluation Criteria   
 We invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
 Soundness | : This aspect pertains to how well the paper’s contributions — whether they involve new methodologies, applications of existing techniques to unfamiliar problems, empirical studies, or other research methods — address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures. For short papers, the expectation is for more limited evaluations given their narrower scope. 
  Relevance | : The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering. 
  Novelty | : How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies. 
  Presentation | : How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided. 
  Replicability | : The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works. All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy below. 
  Junior PC   
 Following two successful editions of the MSR Shadow PC in 2021 and 2022 (see also this paper  and this presentation  for more context), and the success of the Junior PC in MSR 2023 and MSR 2024, MSR 2025 will once again integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!  
 The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members, in response to a widely-recognized challenge of scaling peer review capacity as the research community and volume of submissions grows over time. As with the previous Shadow and Junior PC, the primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).  
 Prior to the MSR submission deadline, all PC members, including the junior reviewers, will receive guidance on review quality, confidentiality, and ethics standards, how to write good reviews, and how to participate in discussions (see ACM reviewers’ responsibilities  ). Junior reviewers will then serve alongside regular PC members on the main technical track PC, participating fully in the review process, including author responses and PC discussions to reach a consensus. In addition, Junior PC members will receive feedback on how to improve their reviews throughout the process.  
 All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers, as always. Based on our experience with the MSR Shadow and Junior PC, we expect that the addition of junior reviewers to each paper will increase the overall quality of reviews the authors receive, since junior reviewers will typically have a deep understanding of recent topics, and can thus provide deep technical feedback on the subject.  
 Submission Process   
 Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines  (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf options).  
 Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the submission site  by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing. All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:  
 All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance). 
  Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
  By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to MSR 2025 | must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ICSE has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
  The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular: | Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission. 
  All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to MSR 2025. 
  During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. We recommend using a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites. 
  Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | Q&A page from ICSEs | . 
  New this year: | By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | authorship policy of the ACM | , and | the authorship policy of the IEEE | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM-published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgments section of the Work.” - ACM 
  “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
  Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.  
 Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.  
 Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.  
 Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers. At least one author of each paper is expected to register and present the paper at the MSR 2025 conference. All accepted contributions will be published in the electronic proceedings of the conference.  
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to an Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)  Special Issue. The authors of accepted papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community will have a chance to self-nominate their paper for the MSR FOSS Impact Award.  
 Open Science Policy   
 The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Indeed, we consider replicability as an explicit evaluation criterion. We expect all contributing authors to disclose the (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.   
 Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:  
 the source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data. 
  the data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.) 
  instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results. 
  Fostering artifacts as open data and open source should be done as:  
 Archived on preserved digital repositories such as | zenodo.org | , | figshare.com | , | www.softwareheritage.org | , | osf.io | , or institutional repositories. GitHub, GitLab, and similar services for version control systems do not offer properly archived and preserved data. Personal or institutional websites, consumer cloud storage such as Dropbox, or services such as Academia.edu and Researchgate.net may not provide properly archived and preserved data and may increase the risk of violating anonymity if used at submission time. 
  Data should be released under a recognized open data license such as the | CC0 | dedication or the | CC-BY 4.0 | license when publishing the data. 
  Software should be released under an | open source license | . 
  Different open licenses, if mandated by institutions or regulations, are also permitted. 
  We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).  
 We recognize that anonymizing artifacts such as source code is more difficult than preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best-effort approach to not reveal their identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories and other such information that is not easily anonymized. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may also look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  , which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  
 For additional information on creating open artifacts and open access pre- and post-prints, please see this ICSE 2023 page  .
