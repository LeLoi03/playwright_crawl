 Call for Short Papers    
 We invite short paper contributions to The Web Conference 2025 (formerly known as WWW). The Web Conference is the premier conference focused on understanding the current state and the evolution of the Web through the lens of different disciplines, including computing, computational social science, economics and political sciences.   

 The Short Papers Track is a forum to foster interactions among researchers and practitioners by allowing them to present their new and innovative work. In addition, the track will enable conference attendees to learn novel ongoing research projects through informal interactions.   

 Submitted posters are expected to be aligned with one or more of the relevant topics of The Web Conference community (such as those covered by the research tracks   ).   

 Important Dates    
  
 Paper submission: December 10, 2024 
  Notification to authors: January 20, 2025 
  Camera ready: February 12, 2025 

 All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE)   time zone.   

 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE  : The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   

 Submission Guidelines    
 Formatting Requirements  . Formatting Requirements. Submissions must be written in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format   (also available   in Overleaf). Word users may use the Word Interim Template. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:   

 \documentclass[sigconf, review]{acmart}.    

 Submission must be as a single PDF file: 4  ( four  ) pages in length, including references.   

 Submission Site  . Submissions must be made through the EasyChair system at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=www25companion   (select the Short Papers  track).   

 Authorship  . Submissions are not  anonymous, hence authors should list their names and affiliations.   

 Reviewing  . Submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the Short Papers Program Committee based on originality, significance, quality, and clarity. The review process will be single-blind.   

 Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent  . Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies   , including ACM's Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies.   

 Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. Note that submitting your research for approval by such may not always be sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by your IRB, the program committee might raise additional concerns about the ethical implications of the work and include these concerns in its review.   

 Publication and Presentation Policies    
 Publication  . Each accepted paper will be included in the Companion  Proceedings of the Web Conference 2025.   

 Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct  conference registration, e.g., two papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) or Main Conference (3-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the camera-ready deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.   

 Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference as a poster. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings. All papers will be asked to produce a poster on-site.
