 Episode 15: Q&A with Mark Papermaster, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Technology and Engineering at AMD  
 We sat down with Mark Papermaster, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Technology and Engineering at AMD, at Rebooting Computing Week last year in Washington, D.C. to discuss the future of computing. During our interview, Mark shared what he thinks will come after Moore's Law, the likelihood of high performance computing undergoing a mass deployment in the next five years, machine learning, and much more. Mark also talks about how we are at an incredible inflection point in the computing industry. What does that inflection point hold? Let's listen to what Mark has to say.
