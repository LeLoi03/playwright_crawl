  Nobel Prize to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton  
 At IWANN we join in the congratulation to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton for the Nobel Prize in Physics  awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. We are ecstatic by the recognition of the field of Machine Learning and Neural Networks implied by the prize. Already at the first IWANN  edition in 1991, two papers ( this  and this  ) had the word “Hopfield” in their title, bearing witness to the high interest that John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton’s work has always raised in IWANN audience.  
 Tutorial: AI and Digital Twins in Healthcare  
 We are glad to announce that the tutorial AI and Digital Twins in Healthcare  will take place during IWANN 2025, delivered by Julià Camps. The tutorial can be attended by all IWANN 2025 participants, with no need for an additional registration.  
 First Call for Papers  
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee of the International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN 2025), we are pleased to invite you to participate in this event that will be held in June 2025 in A Coruña (Spain). This will be the 18th edition of IWANN, following on from an uninterrupted sequence of a staggering 34 years.  
 This biennial meeting seeks to provide a discussion forum for scientists, engineers, educators and students about the latest discoveries and realizations in the foundations, theory, models and applications of systems inspired by nature, as well as in emerging areas related to the above items, using computational intelligence methodologies. As in previous editions, we strongly emphasize the wide range of topics comprised under the umbrella of IWANN2025, from which we present a non-exhaustive list of areas of interest for the congress to get a flavour of IWANN25’s orientation:  
 Mathematical and theoretical methods in computational intelligence 
  Deep Learning 
  Learning and adaptation 
  Emulation of cognitive functions 
  Bio-inspired systems and neuro-engineering 
  Advanced topics in computational intelligence 
  Agent based models 
  Time series forecasting 
  Robotics and cognitive systems 
  Interactive systems and BCI 
  Machine Learning for 4.0 industry solutions 
  AI Health 
  AI in 5G technology 
  Social and Ethical aspects of AI 
  General Applications of AI 
  The approach will be both theoretical and practical, through invited talks, tutorials, workshops, posters, presentation of demos and functional prototypes. Besides, we offer the possibility to carry out a limited number of virtual presentations for those who want to participate but have serious difficulties to travel. The proceedings will include all the presented communications to the conference. As in previous editions of IWANN, we are arranging the publication of the proceedings with Springer-Verlag as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and the books will be available shortly after the Congress in order to allow the authors to incorporate suggestions and improvements from the presentations. It is also foreseen the publication of extended versions of selected papers in special issues of several prestigious journals. Previous congresses led to special issues of Neural Computing and Applications, PLoS One and Neural Processing Letters. We are working to have at least the same collaborations.  
 We hope to see you in A Coruña next June. Do not miss on the deadline  !!
