 Search tips  
   
 Wildcards   
  Use * (asterix) to replace part of a word e.g. At* will include results for both Atlantis and Atlas. Use ? (questionmark) to replace a character in a name if you are unsure of the spelling.  
 AND- / OR- search   
  You can use AND and OR in searches. Searching for humans AND capital will only return results that contains both words. Searching for humans OR capital will return results containing either of the words.  
 Setting quotationmarks around a search sentense will only return results containing the whole sentence.
