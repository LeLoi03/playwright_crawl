 RESEARCH PROFILE  
   
 George Fletcher is Full Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of Technology where he chairs the Database Group in the Data and Artificial Intelligence Cluster. His main area of study is data systems, focusing on social aspects of data systems and the theoretical and engineering foundations of query and schema languages. He is currently investigating data systems education and the management of graph data such as social networks, knowledge graphs, biological networks, and communication networks.  

 ACADEMIC BACKGROUND  
   
 George did his graduate work at Indiana University Bloomington, where he defended a PhD in computer science. His undergraduate studies in mathematics and cognitive science were completed at the University of North Florida. Currently, he is executive board member of the EDBT Association and an associate editor for ACM SIGMOD Record and the Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge.
