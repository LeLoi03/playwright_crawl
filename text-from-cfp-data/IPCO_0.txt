   The Origins of IPCO  
 The idea of organizing a conference on integer programming and combinatorial optimization which consists of papers selected by a program committee and presented in a single stream had its origin in 1987. Inspired by the FOCS (= Foundations Of Computer Science) and STOC (= Symposium on the Theory Of Computation) meetings in the theoretical computer science community, Ravi Kannan and Bill Pulleyblank got the idea to propose a conference with a similar format for the mathematical programming community. They discussed the idea with the Executive Committee of the what is today the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS)  and received strong encouragement. The Society responded positively and agreed to be an official sponsor. The Department of Combinatorics and Optimization of the University of Waterloo agreed to be the host for the first meeting.  
 In 1988, the first IPCO program committee was formed. It consisted of Vasek Chvatal William Cunningham, Ravi Kannan, Richard Karp, George Nemhauser, William Pulleyblank, and Paul Seymour. The meeting was formally announced at the MPS meeting in Tokyo, at the end of August 1988. The submission deadline of the first IPCO was November 15, 1989. The program committee met in early January 1990 in Oberwolfach, Germany, and in mid January 1990 at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Finally IPCO I took place in Waterloo, May 28-30, 1990.  
 Since then, IPCO has become one of the main events in mathematical programming. It has a high level of quality and an excellent visibility within the community. The general issues of IPCO are now handled by the IPCO steering commitee  . By all conceivable measures, the IPCO conference series is a success.

   The Origins of IPCO  
 The idea of organizing a conference on integer programming and combinatorial optimization which consists of papers selected by a program committee and presented in a single stream had its origin in 1987. Inspired by the FOCS (= Foundations Of Computer Science) and STOC (= Symposium on the Theory Of Computation) meetings in the theoretical computer science community, Ravi Kannan and Bill Pulleyblank got the idea to propose a conference with a similar format for the mathematical programming community. They discussed the idea with the Executive Committee of the what is today the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS)  and received strong encouragement. The Society responded positively and agreed to be an official sponsor. The Department of Combinatorics and Optimization of the University of Waterloo agreed to be the host for the first meeting.  
 In 1988, the first IPCO program committee was formed. It consisted of Vasek Chvatal William Cunningham, Ravi Kannan, Richard Karp, George Nemhauser, William Pulleyblank, and Paul Seymour. The meeting was formally announced at the MPS meeting in Tokyo, at the end of August 1988. The submission deadline of the first IPCO was November 15, 1989. The program committee met in early January 1990 in Oberwolfach, Germany, and in mid January 1990 at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Finally IPCO I took place in Waterloo, May 28-30, 1990.  
 Since then, IPCO has become one of the main events in mathematical programming. It has a high level of quality and an excellent visibility within the community. The general issues of IPCO are now handled by the IPCO steering commitee  . By all conceivable measures, the IPCO conference series is a success.

   The Origins of IPCO  
 The idea of organizing a conference on integer programming and combinatorial optimization which consists of papers selected by a program committee and presented in a single stream had its origin in 1987. Inspired by the FOCS (= Foundations Of Computer Science) and STOC (= Symposium on the Theory Of Computation) meetings in the theoretical computer science community, Ravi Kannan and Bill Pulleyblank got the idea to propose a conference with a similar format for the mathematical programming community. They discussed the idea with the Executive Committee of the what is today the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS)  and received strong encouragement. The Society responded positively and agreed to be an official sponsor. The Department of Combinatorics and Optimization of the University of Waterloo agreed to be the host for the first meeting.  
 In 1988, the first IPCO program committee was formed. It consisted of Vasek Chvatal William Cunningham, Ravi Kannan, Richard Karp, George Nemhauser, William Pulleyblank, and Paul Seymour. The meeting was formally announced at the MPS meeting in Tokyo, at the end of August 1988. The submission deadline of the first IPCO was November 15, 1989. The program committee met in early January 1990 in Oberwolfach, Germany, and in mid January 1990 at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Finally IPCO I took place in Waterloo, May 28-30, 1990.  
 Since then, IPCO has become one of the main events in mathematical programming. It has a high level of quality and an excellent visibility within the community. The general issues of IPCO are now handled by the IPCO steering commitee  . By all conceivable measures, the IPCO conference series is a success.

   The Origins of IPCO  
 The idea of organizing a conference on integer programming and combinatorial optimization which consists of papers selected by a program committee and presented in a single stream had its origin in 1987. Inspired by the FOCS (= Foundations Of Computer Science) and STOC (= Symposium on the Theory Of Computation) meetings in the theoretical computer science community, Ravi Kannan and Bill Pulleyblank got the idea to propose a conference with a similar format for the mathematical programming community. They discussed the idea with the Executive Committee of the what is today the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS)  and received strong encouragement. The Society responded positively and agreed to be an official sponsor. The Department of Combinatorics and Optimization of the University of Waterloo agreed to be the host for the first meeting.  
 In 1988, the first IPCO program committee was formed. It consisted of Vasek Chvatal William Cunningham, Ravi Kannan, Richard Karp, George Nemhauser, William Pulleyblank, and Paul Seymour. The meeting was formally announced at the MPS meeting in Tokyo, at the end of August 1988. The submission deadline of the first IPCO was November 15, 1989. The program committee met in early January 1990 in Oberwolfach, Germany, and in mid January 1990 at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Finally IPCO I took place in Waterloo, May 28-30, 1990.  
 Since then, IPCO has become one of the main events in mathematical programming. It has a high level of quality and an excellent visibility within the community. The general issues of IPCO are now handled by the IPCO steering commitee  . By all conceivable measures, the IPCO conference series is a success.
