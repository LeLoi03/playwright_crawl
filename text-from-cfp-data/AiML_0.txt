  Call for Papers  
  
  AiML 2024: 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN MODAL LOGIC  
  PRAGUE, 19–23 AUGUST 2024  
 Advances in Modal Logic is an initiative aimed at presenting the state of the art in modal logic and its various applications. The initiative consists of a conference series together with volumes based on the conferences.  
 AiML 2024 will be co-located with the 21st International Conference on Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science (RAMiCS 2024).

  TOPICS  
 We invite submissions on all aspects of modal and related logic, including (but not limited to):  
 proof theory, semantics or automated deduction 
  applications of modal logic 
  history of modal logic 
  philosophy of modal logic 
  computational or theoretical aspects 
  specific instances and variations of modal logic (description logics, modal logics over non-boolean bases, dynamic logics and other process logics, epistemic and deontic logics, modal logics for agent-based systems, modal logic and game theory, modal logic and grammar formalisms, provability and interpretability logics, spatial and temporal logics, hybrid logic, intuitionistic logic, substructural logics, computationally light fragments of all such logics)

  PAPER SUBMISSIONS  
 There will be two types of submissions for AiML 2024:  
 (1) Full papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. 
  (2) Short presentations intended for presentation at the conference but not for the published proceedings. 
   
 Both types of papers should be submitted electronically using the EasyChair submission page:  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiml2024   
  
  (1) FULL PAPERS  
 Authors are invited to submit, for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings, full papers reporting on original research and not submitted elsewhere.  
 The submissions should be at most 15 pages (references excluded), with an optional technical appendix of up to 5 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of 100-200 words. The submissions must be typeset in LaTeX, using the AiML LaTeX template  .  
 Authors must submit an abstract in plain text via EasyChair  by the abstract deadline prior to full submission of their paper.  
 The presentations of accepted full papers will be 30 minutes long.  
  
  (2) SHORT PRESENTATIONS  
 Submissions of extended abstracts of up to 5 pages plus references are also welcome, and will be subject to reviewing. The accepted submissions will be made available at the conference, and the authors will have the opportunity to give short presentations (of up to 15 minutes) on them.  
  
  At least one author of each accepted paper or short presentation must register for and attend the conference.
