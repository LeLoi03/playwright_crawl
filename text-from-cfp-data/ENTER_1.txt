 ENTER25 eTourism conference  
 Call for contributions  
 17-21 February 2025 – Wrocław, Poland  

 Conference theme   
  
 eTourism Towards 2060:  Information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to revolutionize travel, tourism, and hospitality. Over 30+ years, the ENTER eTourism conference has been at the forefront of providing insight on the use and impact of new technologies for travel, tourism and hospitality practitioners and researchers. However, the rapid development and deployment of new developments, including Generative AI (GenAI), service robotics, Internet of Things, and Extended Realities (XR) technologies, among others, call for a rapid and careful reassessment of ICT in tourism, particularly including ethical and societal considerations. If an AI-assistant books the wrong itinerary, who is to blame? Will customer service bots replace human workers? What is best for both the tourist and the tourism industry, as well as economies and societies as a whole?   

 This call for contributions invites the academic and professional eTourism community to challenge and co-create the next decades of e-tourism, preparing tourism stakeholders for what the future will bring.  
 ENTER25 eTourism conference  continues the tradition of bringing together people, ideas, and research from all over the world to find answers to the burning questions the industry is facing. This year, some of these questions include:  

 What will / can / should the future of tourism look like? 
  What role can new ICT technologies such as AI, robotics, IoT and XR play in creating a sustainable future for e-tourism? 
  How can technology help create businesses and organizations that are agile, innovative, and resilient in a time of constant flux? 
  What is the role of technology in accelerating sustainable development? 
  How will emerging technologies impact the customer and employee experience? 
  How will technologies reshape the tourism and hospitality higher education landscape? 
  What challenges and dangers does technological disruption bring to the tourism and hospitality field and how can we address them? 

 The  International Federation for IT and Travel & Tourism (IFITT)   together with IFITT Poland, call for the global eTourism community, academics, technology, and travel and hospitality business, destinations, and NGOs to contribute to ENTER Conference and think about how technologies will continue shaping the future of the tourism industry. The conference, with the theme  eTourism Towards 2060  , contributes to the science and practice of tourism and provides various stakeholders with possibilities to network, innovate, learn, experience, and develop the tourism field.   
 We invite the entire academic and professional research community to submit cutting-edge research and the latest case studies on emergent and innovative ICT concepts, applications, and business models to be shared at the ENTER25 eTourism conference. Submissions are invited for the following formats:
