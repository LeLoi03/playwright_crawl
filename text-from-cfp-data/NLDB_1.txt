 Conference Tracks  
 Main  
 The main track solicits novel and significant research contributions addressing theoretical aspects, algorithms, applications, architectures, resources, and other aspects of NLP, as well as survey and discussion papers. We welcome work describing original and replicable research showing evidence of significant contribution to the NLP community.  
 Industry  
 The industry track covers all aspects of innovative commercial or industrial-strength NLP technologies in order to showcase the state of adoption. It welcomes contributions about case studies of success stories, discussion reports of obstacles that stand in the way of adoption of NLP technologies, and experience reports in applying recent research advances to relevant industry problems. We encourage results and ideas from companies small and large.  

 Publication  
 The conference proceedings will be publisehd in Lecture Notes in Computer Science  (LNCS, Springer).  
 Journal Publication  
 Best papers will be invited to publish in the special issue of Data & Knowledge Engineering  (DKE, Elsevier).
