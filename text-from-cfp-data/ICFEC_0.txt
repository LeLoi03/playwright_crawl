 Who am I (short bio)   
 I received my Ph.D. from Grenoble Institute of Technologies in September 2006 and my M.S. degree from the University of Grenoble in 2003. During my PhD, I suggested a new way to handle I/O requests in multi-application clusters. This proposal led to the aIOLi project, an I/O scheduler framework for HPC file systems. In the meantime, I worked on the NFSp project, a non intrusive implementation of a parallel NFS server. Until these websites will be shutdown, you should find further details (PhD thesis, publications, code documentations) on the aIOLi  's and NFSp  's sites.  
  Between 2006 and 2008, I held a postdoc position at Inria in the framework of the XtreemOS project  EU IP project. During this position, I had been in charge of designing and developing kDFS  (a kernel Distributed File System).  
  I joined the "ASCOLA Research Group  at the Ecole des Mines de Nantes on September 2008 where I worked on distributed cloud computing challenges (see Beyond the Clouds  initiative as well as the FEMDC Working Group  of the OpenStack community). These activities led in part to the creation of the STACK Research Group that I have been leading since November 2017.

 Research Interest   
 Distributed Computing (Cloud/Fog/Edge) 
  Resource management systems 
  (Distributed) Operating Systems 
  Distributed File Systems/Key Value Stores 
  Virtualizations 
  More precisely I investigate the interest of recent programming models (such as event or component programming) in the design of new systems to help administrators and DevOps manage large-scale geo-distributed infrastructures/applications. I'm currently working on two particular challenges leveraging locality as a key point of the design:  
 Proposing new storage layers to reduce the impact of the network at WAN level. 
  Investigating new approaches to deal with geo-distribution aspects without increasing the complexity of the business logic of an application.
