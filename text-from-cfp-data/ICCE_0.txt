  Call for Papers  
  The 42nd IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE 2025) is the IEEE Consumer Technology Society’s annual flagship conference that will take place in conjunction with CES. ICCE 2025 will bring together top professionals from industry, government, and academia from around the world. The theme of the conference is "Creating Our Future with Consumer Technology". The conference will provide networking opportunities for participants to share ideas, designs, and experiences on the state-of-the-art and future direction of consumer technologies. ICCE 2025 will feature comprehensive high-quality technical and industry programs covering traditional and contemporary topics delivered through lecture, and interactive oral presentations, tutorials, industry forums, mixed panels and high profile keynotes. Authors should register under the "Full" registration category to get their papers published in the Conference Proceedings and IEEE Xplore®. Authors with multiple papers must register each paper separately with the requisite fee. Authors of selected papers with the highest reviews may be invited to extend their conference papers into high quality journal papers to special issues of peer-reviewed journals of CTSoc (e.g., IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics and IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine).
