  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Architecture  :  
  This track focuses on studies related to both existing and emerging architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; manycore, multicores, accelerators, domain-specific and special-purpose architectures, reconfigurable architectures; memory technologies and hierarchies; volatile and non-volatile emerging memory technologies, solid-state devices; exascale system designs; data center and warehouse-scale architectures; novel big data architectures; network and interconnect architectures; emerging technologies for interconnects; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience, security, and dependable architectures; emerging architectural trends for machine learning, approximate computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic, analog, and bio-inspired computing.  
 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware.

 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

 IPDPS 2024 NOW OPEN FOR SUBMISSIONS  
 Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by | Thursday, September 28, 2023 
  Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by | Thursday, October 5, 2023 
  All deadlines are end of day | ANYWHERE ON EARTH. 
  Before submitting, review the information under | WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below. 
  SUBMIT YOUR PAPER 
    
 Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present novel and impactful research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing. Works focusing on emerging technologies, interdisciplinary work spanning multiple IPDPS focus areas, and novel open-source artifacts are welcome. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Computational Science:   
  This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of computational science methods. Examples of computations forming these workloads include structured and unstructured grids, dense and sparse linear algebra computations, spectral methods, and n-body computations. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to tightly coupled systems, such as those supporting communication, synchronization, and power management.  
 Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Data Science:  
   This track focuses on parallel and distributed (to include cloud, edge, and fog computing) algorithms arising in the context of execution of data science methods, including machine learning, data mining, graph computations, clustering, visualization, and other forms of data analytic methods. Also included in this track are algorithmic and theory contributions that are workload agnostic but specific to loosely coupled systems, such as those for management of distributed resources, and those related to distributed data and transactions as well as mobility.  
 Applications:  
   The focus of this track is on papers that develop applications to solve problems using parallel and distributed computing concepts. Papers submitted to this track are expected to incorporate considerations specific to the target application area.  Topics may include the design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel and distributed applications. If the primary focus is on novel or generalizable methodologies for modeling, analyzing, or evaluating performance, the paper might be better suited to the to the "Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments" track.  
 Programming Models, Compilers, and Runtime Systems:  
   This track covers topics ranging from the design of parallel programming models and paradigms to languages and compilers supporting these models and paradigms, to runtime and middleware solutions. Software that is close to the application (as opposed to the bare hardware) but not specific to an application is included – examples include frameworks targeting cloud and distributed systems; application frameworks for fault tolerance and resilience; software supporting data management, scalable data analytics and similar workloads, and runtime systems for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.  
 System Software:  
   This track focuses on software that is close to the bare hardware. Topics include storage and I/O systems; system software for resource management, job scheduling, and energy-efficiency; system software support for accelerators and heterogeneous HPC computing systems; interactions between the OS and the hardware with other software layers; system software support for fault tolerance and resilience; containers and virtual machines; specialized operating systems and related support for high performance computing; and system software for future novel computing platforms including quantum, neuromorphic, and bio-inspired computing.

 Measurements, Modeling, and Experiments  :  
   This track focuses on experiments and performance-oriented studies in the practice of parallel and distributed computing. “Performance” may be construed broadly to include metrics related to time, energy, power, accuracy, and resilience, for instance. Topics include: methods, experiments, and tools for measuring, evaluating, and/or analyzing performance for large-scale applications and systems; design and experimental evaluation of applications of parallel and distributed computing in simulation and analysis; experiments on the use of novel commercial or research architectures, accelerators, quantum and neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; innovations made in support of large-scale infrastructures and facilities; and methods for and experiences allocating and managing system and facility resources.  
 Best Paper Award   
 The program committee will select a small set of top-quality papers as best paper finalists, and one paper as the winner, for recognition with the Best Paper Award.  
 Best Open-Source Contribution Award   
 IPDPS welcomes submissions with open-source tool and dataset artifacts, relevant to the parallel and distributed computing community, as one of their technical contributions. The authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to identify if they wish their submissions to be considered for the best open-source contribution award. Such papers will be evaluated by a dedicated open-source tool and dataset artifacts committee. A small set of such papers will be identified as the best open-source contribution paper finalists as appropriate and applicable based on the quality of the contribution. One paper may be selected as the winner among the finalists, for recognition with the Best Open-Source Contribution Award, depending upon the contribution level and the recommendation from the committee. The two award categories are not exclusive (a paper can be nominated for both the best paper award and best open-source contribution award).  
 WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT   
 Abstracts of at most 500 words must be submitted by September 28, 2023. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 5, 2023; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including all figures and tables. There is no page limit for references, which must be complete and include all author names. The submitted manuscripts should not include author names and affiliations, or otherwise disclose the identity of the authors, because a double-blind review process will be followed.  
 The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions here   .  
 Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the IPDPS 2024 Submission Site (powered by Linklings). Click here to submit abstract and register your paper by September 28th.    
 A “primary” track must be marked, and an optional “secondary” track may also be specified.  
 REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS   
 All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.  
 A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:  
 Motivation. | Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving. 
  Limitations of state-of-art approaches. | Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works. 
  Key insights and contributions. | Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable. 
  Methodology. | Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided. 
  Limitations of the proposed approach. | As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper. 
  The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review-quality (author experience) and reviewing-experience.   
 Authors will have the opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and provide clarifications before the first-round decisions are made. Note that not all submissions may be invited to submit a response/rebuttal. The submissions that are not invited to submit a response/rebuttal will be notified with an early-reject decision by December 4, 2023.  
 Questions may be sent to pc2024@ipdps.org   . Abstracts are due September 28, 2023, and full manuscripts must be received by October 5, 2023. This is a final, hard deadline. To ensure fairness, no extensions will be given.  
 Preliminary decisions will be sent by December 18, 2023, with a decision of either “accept”, “revise”, or “reject”. Authors of papers in the “revise” decision will have the opportunity to submit a new version addressing reviewers’ comments. Such a revised submission will be due on January 18, 2024, with a cover letter explaining the changes. The ensuing review process for such submissions will result in decisions of either “accept” or “reject”, the latter for the cases where the reviewers assess that the issues they raised were not satisfactorily and sufficiently addressed. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 30, 2024, and camera-ready papers will be due on February 22, 2024  February 29, 2024.  
 ArXiv Submission Policy   
 Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to IPDPS 2024. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).  
 Guidance on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text (e.g., ChatGPT)   
 IPDPS will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you review your submission for language issues through these services. It is not mandatory to use these external services and you should judge if the results are satisfactory. As required by IEEE   , the use of any AI-generated text shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.  
 Inclusive Description of Research Contributions   
 Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.
