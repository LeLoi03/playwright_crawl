 ABOUT CLOUDCOM  
 CloudCom is a premier international conference on Cloud Computing, attracting academia and industrial researchers, practitioners, engineers, and students from the fields of cloud computing, edge computing, virtualization, security and privacy, big data, systems architecture service-oriented architecture, and high-performance computing. It has a long tradition of emphasizing how to build cloud computing platforms with impact. The conference is co-sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Cloud Computing Association. Every year it attracts world class researchers to explore the new challenges, present leading-edge innovations, and identify emerging technologies. The 15th CloudCom in 2024 will continue this well-established tradition and travel to the Middle East to be held in the cosmopolitan city of Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, from December 9 to December 11, 2024.
