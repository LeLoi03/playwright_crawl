 Present CFP : 2025 
 The 17th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX’25) will take place in Madrid, Spain, from September 30 to October 2, 2025. This event will gather top experts from both academia and industry to showcase and discuss the latest research on multimedia quality, Quality of Experience (QoE), and User Experience (UX).  
   
  The topic of this year is "Thinking of a QoE (r)evolution". On the edge of QoMEX “coming of age”, it is time to rethink the purpose and methods of QoE research: cross-fertilizing with adjacent fields, reaching more diverse populations, or exploring novel techniques and paradigms.  
   
  Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers (up to 6 pages for technical content including figures and references, and one optional 7th page containing only references) or short/demo papers (3 +1 page of references) to the general track, dataset and tools track, or to special sessions. Each paper will undergo a double-blind review process. Accepted and presented papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published in IEEE Xplore.  
   
  The conference will be held in form of oral, poster and plenary sessions. The QoMEX 2024 organizing committee solicits contributions including, but not limited to topics:  
   
  Innovative Approaches and Paradigms in QoE Research  
   
  - Revolutionary and disruptive approaches in QoE research  
  - Novel paradigms for QoE assessment  
  - Quality of sustainable experiences (QoSE)  
  - QoE and the value of services  
   
  Foundations and Methodologies in QoE Research  
   
  - Multimedia QoE and User eXperience  
  - User assessment and evaluation methods  
  - Objective models for QoE and media quality  
  - Replicability and transparency in QoE research

  Technological Innovations and QoE  
   
  - QoE management in networks and systems  
  - QoE in the era of big data and deep learning  
  - User-centricity and key value indicators in 6G  
   
  Human Factors and Interdisciplinary Connections  
   
  - QoE, Quality of Life (QoL), and well-being  
  - Diversity, inclusivity, ethics, and accessibility in QoE  
  - Human-Computer Interaction and novel interaction techniques  
  - Human factors in multimedia experiences  
   
  Specific Applications and Use Cases  
   
  - User research and experience for specific applications: gaming, education, training, healthcare, culture, etc.
