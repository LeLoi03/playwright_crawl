 The 9th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks, and Systems   
 Universidade do Algarve Campus de Gambelas, Faro, Portugal   
 Past editions: 2013  Limassol, Cyprus; 2010  Athens, Greece; 2009  Madrid, Spain; 2008  London, Great Britain; 2007  Raleigh, North Carolina, US; 2006  San Jose, California, US; 2005  Boston, Massachusetts, US; 2004  San Jose, California, US;  
 Scope    
 The 5G vision targets a digital and connected landscape, where not only people but devices will be connected to what is referred to as the Internet of Everything (IoE). Real life objects will be smart in nature, and possibly virtual, allowing everyday activities to be performed remotely at the touch of a button in seamless manner. In this context, new technologies are required such as connectivity that can transport information effectively according to the application data. However, for real life objects to come a life, these will be animated through cyber physical technology, that include sensors, actuators and embedded software. Where embedded systems was once constrained to consumer devices, now it comes to the forefront playing a pivotal role in the 5G paradigm, allowing devices to become objects, and objects to form part of an integrated system, where different devices employing diverse data formats and operating systems are no longer barriers.  
 The scope of this conference will target one of the key drivers for 5G, the IoE world that includes technology advances in cyber physical systems and security. The conference is also interested in novel works applying 5G concepts to space and underwater communications. The conference aims to provide a platform where to disseminate and discuss key innovations and technology trends on this fast evolving arena.
