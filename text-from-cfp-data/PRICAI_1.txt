 Scope and Background   
 The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI) is an annual global event focusing on AI theories, technologies, and their practical applications across scientific, social, and economic domains relevant to the Pacific Rimâ€™s unique social and economic challenges. Previous PRICAI conferences have been held in Gold Coast (2014), Phuket (2016), Nanjing (2018), Fiji (2019), Yokohama (2020), Hanoi (2021), Shanghai (2022), and Jakarta (2023). The 21st Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2024) will be held at the Clock Tower Centennial Hall of Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The Program Committee invites technical papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all areas of Artificial Intelligence. PRICAI 2024 aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, educators, and users in AI and related communities for in-depth intellectual exchanges, research cooperation, and professional development.  
  
 Paper Submission   
 Proceedings of PRICAI 2024 will be published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) proceedings volume. PRICAI 2024 solicits regular and short papers. Regular papers may be up to 12 pages in length, including references, while short papers may be up to 6 pages, including references. All papers should be submitted electronically using the conference management tool in PDF format and formatted using the Springer LNAI template. Submitted papers must not be published or under consideration to be published elsewhere. PRICAI reviewing follows a double-blind process. Authors are unaware of the identities of the reviewers, and reviewers cannot deduce the names of the authors from the submission. Authors must refrain from including any information that might reveal their identities anywhere in the submission. Failure to adhere to this guideline could result in rejection without review.
