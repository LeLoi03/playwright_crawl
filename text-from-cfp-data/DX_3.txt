 Research Topics  
 Machine learning for the discretization of hybrid, time-dependent state spaces:   
 Signals of complex plants today contain both discrete and continuous information. By converting them to value-discrete and discrete-time states, problems such as predictive maintenance, optimization and diagnostics can be addressed.

 Anomaly Detection for High-Dimensional, Time-Prone Signals of Technical Systems:   
 By learning models of normal behavior, non normal operating conditions can be detected early (condition monitoring) and downtimes predicted (predictive maintenance).

 Machine-learning-based diagnosis algorithms for complex production facilities:  
 Unlike the detection of anomalies, the use of machine learning methods in diagnosis, i.e. the detection of the causes of the errors, is more difficult. Enhancements to the established model-based diagnostics will enable future adaptive, complex systems to be diagnosed based on data.

 Use of A-Priori Knowledge to Improve Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence  :  
 Technical systems are characterized by the abundance of a-priori knowledge such as system structures and physical laws. As a result, methods of machine learning require less data and become extrapolatable. Furthermore, methods of artificial intelligence such as diagnosis can use causal relationships and calculate optimizations.
