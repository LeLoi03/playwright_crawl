 What is the ISRR?  
    Panel discussion with keynote speakers during the ISRR12 conference   
   The Society’s aim is to promote cooperation and communication between root researchers around the world. Hopefully you will join  us in this endeavour.  
  The main activity of the International Society of Root Research is to hold regular scientific meetings at which the latest root research can be presented. Our meetings in Scotland  , Australia  , and Israel  each attracted over 300 participants on site. The ISRR10 was also featured on twitter  and youtube  . The ISRR1, organized by University of Missouri ( USA  ), was held as an online conference in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest symposium, ISRR12 was held in Leipzig Germany in 2024.
