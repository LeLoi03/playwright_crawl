 By Katina Michael  on October 5th, 2021 in Artificial Intelligence (AI)  , Call for Papers  , Call for Papers  , Ethics  , Social Implications of Technology  , Societal Impact  , Transactions   
  
 An element of the expansion of digital technologies is a shift in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology from research laboratories into the hands of anyone with a smartphone.

Wide AI diffusion is then reshaping the way organizations, communities and individuals’ function. The potentially radical consequences of AI have pushed nation states across the globe to publish strategies on how they seek to shape, drive and leverage the disruptive capabilities offered by AI technologies to bolster their prosperity and security.
