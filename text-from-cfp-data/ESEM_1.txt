 ESEIW 2024 & ESEM 2024  
   
 Welcome to the joint website of ESEIW 2024  , the Empirical Software Engineering International Week 2024, and ESEM 2024  , the 18th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement.  
 The ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) is the premier conference for presenting research results related to empirical software engineering. ESEM provides a stimulating forum where researchers and practitioners can present and discuss recent research results on a wide range of topics, in addition to exchanging ideas, experiences, and challenging problems.

  Keynotes   
 Sira Vegas (UPM): The Method Behind the Magic: Ensuring Reliability in Software Engineering Empirical Results   

  Empirical software engineering research plays a critical role in advancing the field, but the reliability of findings depends heavily on the rigor of the methodology. In this keynote, I will discuss the importance of addressing key aspects of validity—internal, construct, and statistical conclusion validity—when conducting empirical studies. Using two prevalent research areas, Mining Software Repositories (MSR) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, I will illustrate common methodological challenges. Through these examples, I will explore potential strategies and considerations for improving study design and analysis, aiming to enhance the reliability and scientific contribution of empirical software engineering studies, ultimately driving more robust insights and advancements in the field.  
  
 David Lo (Singapore Management University): Charting New Frontiers: Exploring Limits, Threats, and Ecosystems of LLMs in Software Engineering   

  Large language models (LLMs) are transforming software engineering, but their adoption brings critical challenges. In this keynote, I will explore three key thrusts: the limits  of LLMs, including their struggles with long-tailed data distributions and the quality of generated outputs; the threats  they pose, such as their robustness, vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks and the memorization of sensitive information; and the emerging ecosystems  surrounding their reuse, licensing, and documentation practices. Empirical research plays a pivotal role in uncovering these challenges and guiding the responsible development of LLMs in software engineering. By addressing these issues, we can chart a path forward for future research and innovation in this rapidly evolving field.
