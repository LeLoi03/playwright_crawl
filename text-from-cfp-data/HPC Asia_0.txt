 Whitepaper  
 From Hallucination to Reality  
 As Federal agencies navigate an increasingly complex and data-driven world, learning how to get the most out of high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) technologies is imperative to their mission. These technologies can significantly improve efficiency and effectiveness and drive innovation to serve citizens' needs better. Implementing HPC and AI solutions in government can bring challenges and pain points like fragmented datasets, computational hurdles when training ML models, and ethical implications of AI-driven decision-making. Still, CTG Federal, Dell Technologies, and NVIDIA unite to unlock new possibilities and seamlessly integrate HPC capabilities into existing enterprise architectures. This integration empowers organizations to glean actionable insights, improve decision-making, and gain a competitive edge across various domains, from supply chain optimization to financial modeling and beyond.

 Whitepaper  
 Why IT Must Have an Influential Role in Strategic Decisions About Sustainability  
 Data centers are experiencing increasing power consumption, space constraints and cooling demands due to the unprecedented computing power required by today’s chips and servers. HVAC cooling systems consume approximately 40% of a data center’s electricity. These systems traditionally use air conditioning, air handling and fans to cool the data center facility and IT equipment, ultimately resulting in high energy consumption and high carbon emissions. Data centers are moving to direct liquid cooled (DLC) systems to improve cooling efficiency thus lowering their PUE, operating expenses (OPEX) and carbon footprint.  
   
  This paper describes how CoolIT Systems (CoolIT) meets the need for improved energy efficiency in data centers and includes case studies that show how CoolIT’s DLC solutions improve energy efficiency, increase rack density, lower OPEX, and enable sustainability programs. CoolIT is the global market and innovation leader in scalable DLC solutions for the world’s most demanding computing environments. CoolIT’s end-to-end solutions meet the rising demand in cooling and the rising demand for energy efficiency.
