 ICFP 2025  
   
 Welcome to the website of the ICFP 2025 conference.  
 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) is an annual programming language conference that provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries.  
 This year, for the first time in history, ICFP will be co-located with SPLASH  and its satellite events as a part of the joint ICFP/SPLASH 2025  conference.  
 We are working hard to fill the website with all related information. Please check back soon!
