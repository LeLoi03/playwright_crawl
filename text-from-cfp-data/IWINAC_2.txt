 Abstract :  In this survey we discuss different state-of-the-art approaches of combining exact algorithms and metaheuristics to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Some of these hybrids mainly aim at providing optimal solutions in shorter time, while others primarily focus on getting better heuristic solutions. The two main categories in which we divide the approaches are collaborative versus integrative combinations. We further classify the different techniques in a hierarchical way. Altogether, the surveyed work on combinations of exact algorithms and metaheuristics documents the usefulness and strong potential of this research direction.

  TL;DR:  This paper describes an evolutionary approach to improving solutions to mixed integer programming (MIP) models, and proposes coarse-grained approaches to mutating and combining MIP solutions, both built within a large-neighborhood search framework.

  TL;DR:  In the proposed heuristic, an objective-restricted neighbourhood generator produces assignments of periods to events, with decreasing numbers of violations of two period-related soft constraints, which define neighbourhoods that are easier to search with respect to all four soft constraints.

  TL;DR:  Iterated Local Search (ILS) as mentioned in this paper is a general purpose metaheuristic for finding good solutions of combinatorial optimization problems, which is based on building a sequence of (locally optimal) solutions by perturbing the current solution and applying local search to that modified solution.

  TL;DR:  A meta-heuristic is an iterative master process that guides and modifies the operations of subordinate heuristics to efficiently produce high-quality solutions as discussed by the authors, and recently, there have been significant advances in the theory and application of metaheuristic to the approximate solutions of hard optimization problems.
