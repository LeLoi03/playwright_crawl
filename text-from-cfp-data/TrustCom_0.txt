  INTRODUCTION    
 With the rapid development and increasing complexity of computer systems and communication networks, user requirements for trust, security and privacy are becoming more and more demanding. Therefore, there is a grand challenge that traditional security technologies and measures may not meet user requirements in open, dynamic, heterogeneous, mobile, wireless, and distributed computing environments. As a result, we need to build systems and networks in which various applications allow users to enjoy more comprehensive services while preserving trust, security and privacy at the same time. As useful and innovative technologies, trusted computing and communications are attracting researchers with more and more attention.  
 The IEEE TrustCom-2023 (22nd IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications) is a forum for presenting leading works on trusted computing and communications, with regard to trust, security, privacy, reliability, dependability, survivability, availability, and fault tolerance aspects of computer systems and networks.  
 The 22nd IEEE TrustCom follows the tradition of previous successful IEEE TrustCom conferences in the years from 2002 to 2022 in Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials and keynote speeches. TrustCom-2023 will be hosted in Exeter, the capital city of Devon and provides the county with a central base for education, medicine, religion, commerce and culture. The city is also home to the magnificent Exeter Cathedral, which dates back to Norman times. Exeter is also ideally placed to base a trip to branch out visiting places such as the famous Dartmoor National Park and the unspoilt beaches of the North and South Devon coastlines.  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to TrustCom-2023. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore and will be indexed by Engineering Index (EI). The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.
