 Call for Best Process Mining Dissertation Award  
  
 Applications are sought from recent recipients of a doctoral degree for the 2018 edition of the best dissertation award in the field of process mining. The award will be delivered at the 1st International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM’2019) on 24-26 June 2019.  
 Eligibility   
 Eligible candidates are those who officially obtained a PhD degree in 2018 based on a doctoral dissertation pertaining to the field of process mining. The term process mining in this setting is interpreted broadly: The use of data produced during the execution of business, software, or system processes, in order to extract knowledge or insights to manage these processes.  
 Prize   
 The winner will receive the award at the ICPM’2019 Conference in Aachen, Germany. The award is connected with a monetary prize (exact amount to be announced later) and a free registration to the ICPM conference. The winner is also offered the option to publish the dissertation thesis in Springer’s LNBIP series.  
 Nomination and Submission   
 Candidates are nominated by their primary supervisor via a nomination letter. Each professor (supervisor or co-supervisor) is only allowed to nominate one candidate. The candidate is responsible for submitting the nomination material via Easychair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpmda2019    
 The submission must include the following documents concatenated in a single PDF file (preferred option) or zipped in a single package:  
 An extended abstract of the thesis (3-5 pages)

  CV of the candidate including publication list 
  Full document of the dissertation 
  Questions and enquiries can be directed to the chairperson of the jury: Marlon Dumas, http://www.cs.ut.ee/~dumas  
 Selection Process   
 The winner of the award will be determined in two steps. First, the jury will evaluate the submission material and identify a short list of three candidates. Second, these three candidates will be invited to give a presentation of their work in an online session with the jury. The jury will then select the winner. The selection will be based on the following criteria:  
 Originality and depth of contribution, 
  Methodological soundness, 
  Form and quality of presentation, and 
  Significance for the research field.
