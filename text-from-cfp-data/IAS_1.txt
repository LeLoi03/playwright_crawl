 Disseminating the latest research  

 We make the latest HIV knowledge available to a wide audience  

 Recognizing the importance of widespread knowledge exchange, the IAS offers two programmes to share the latest HIV research with a broad audience.  
 The Journal of the International AIDS Society  (JIAS)  , a renowned open-access scientific journal, covers various aspects of HIV science, with a special focus on implementation science.  
 The IAS Educational Fund  aims to facilitate bridging the gap between evidence-based science, policy and action. It keeps regional stakeholders updated on the latest HIV research through workshops, symposia and webinars. The fund also provides inclusive educational opportunities to key stakeholders through mentorship opportunities and scholarships for IAS conferences.
