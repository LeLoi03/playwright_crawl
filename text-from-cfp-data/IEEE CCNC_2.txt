 The IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC), sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society, is a major annual international conference. Taking advantage of its co-location with the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which is the world's largest tradeshow on consumer technology, CCNC is organized with the objective of bringing together researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry working in all areas of consumer communications and networking technologies. CCNC 2025 will feature high-quality keynotes, plenary talks, technical and industry papers, panels, tutorials, and demonstrations. In addition, the CCNC 2025 Organization Committee invites members of the research, development, and practitioner communities to submit Workshop and Special Session proposals. Workshops provide a forum for people to discuss areas of special interest with like-minded researchers and practitioners. Special Sessions complement the main program with new or emerging topics that are of particular interest to the consumer communications and networking community and may also cut across and beyond disciplines traditionally represented at CCNC. Research contributions are welcome in all areas pertinent to consumer communications and networking, including:  
 Edge/Cloud Computing and Networking 
  Networking Solutions for Metaverse, Social Applications, Multimedia, and Games 
  Testbeds, Experimentation and Datasets for Communications and Networking 
  Wireless Communications: Fundamentals, PHY and Above 
  Beyond 5G and Towards 6G 
  IoT: From Sensors to Vertical Applications 
  Security, Privacy, and Content Protection 
  Modeling, Simulations, and Digital Twins for Networking and Communications 
  Communications and Applications for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on Land, Water, and Sky 
  AI/ML for Communications and Networking 
  Selected Topic - Millimeter-wave, Terahertz and Optical Communications and Networking 
  Selected Topic - Satellite Networks and Integrated Space-Air-Ground Networks
