 Call for Papers  

 Please note that the “Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers” section has been modified a bit from previous years’.   

 PACMPL Issue PLDI 2024 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue PLDI 2024 will be invited – but not required – to present their work in the PLDI conference in June 2024, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.  
 Scope   
 PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.  
 Evaluation Criteria and Process   
 Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.  
 The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assesses the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers. Authors will have sufficient time to perform the required revisions and re-submit the paper. The same reviewers as in the first round will then assess how the revision requests have been acted upon by the authors. Revisions that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in rejection.  
 The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection, although reviews for a given paper will typically be performed by a subset of the committee. During the review period, authors must not contact Review Committee members – all questions must be addressed to the Associate Editor (who is doing the job that we would have called “Program Chair” before PLDI joined PACMPL). Contacting Review Committee members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and may be grounds for summary rejection.  
 Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced, with extremely rare extenuating circumstances considered at the discretion of the Associate Editor.  
 Double-Blind Reviewing   
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.  
 The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Associate Editor. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.  
 Submission Site Information   
 The submission site is https://pldi2024.hotcrp.com  .  
 Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).  
 The submission deadline is 11:59PM on Thursday November 16, 2023 anywhere on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth   
 Declaring Conflicts   
 When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).  
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.  
 Formatting Requirements   
 Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the SIGPLAN author information page. Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage use of the review  and screen  options as well, e.g.:  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}   Papers may be submmitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use author-year format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.  
 Supplementary Material   
 Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.  
 Plagiarism and Concurrent Work   
 Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity. If you have further questions, please contact the Associate Editor.  
 Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. At artifact submission time, authors will be asked to provide an artifact availability statement that details the expected behavior of the artifact, and how it pertains to the results of the paper. Artifact submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.  
 Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves, and include the artifact availability statement (which will not count agains the page limit). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.  
 Open Access and Copyright   
 As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.  
 Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights:  
 Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice). 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license. 
  Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
  These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.  
 Publication Date   
 All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, which ever is sooner. Note that the date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  
 Presentations   
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. We welcome all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.  
 Distinguished Paper Awards   
 Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The set of distinguished papers will be chosen through a rigorous review process of the final papers, carried out by a subset of the Review Committee.  
 Acknowledgments   
 This call-for-papers is an adaptation and evolution of content from previous SIGPLAN conferences. We are grateful to prior organizers for their work, which is reused here.  
 Code of Conduct   
 PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy  and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior  .  

 Attending  
   
 Presenter Instructions   
 In-Person Presenters   
 You should have received a Google Form entitled “PLDI’24 Presenter Questionnaire”.  
 If not, the URL is https://forms.gle/WCRJqQhEFNSybdrS8  .  
 Please fill in the questionnaire once for each talk you will give.  
 If you are presenting in-person, here are some things to keep in mind:  
 Your conference registration is mandatory  . 
  You should bring your own device  to present your slides. Please ensure your slides are available offline / accessible from a different device in case of any technical issues. 
  Your presentation device should support HDMI output  . If it does not, you are responsible for bringing the appropriate adapter. 
  You are free to choose between 4:3 aspect ratio  and 16:9 aspect ratio  , whichever makes more sense for the content of your slides. We will adapt the streaming/recording layout to your choice. Please indicate your choice in the questionnaire  . 
  Ensure your device is working and your slides are accessible during the break before your session starts  , to avoid last minute difficulties. 
  You should disable any kind of color adjustment on your computer while presenting (e.g., night shift, redshift, f.lux). If you are using a Macbook, please make sure to disable TrueTone in System Settings -> Displays. 
  Arrive at your session at least 10 minutes before it starts  . Take time to familiarize yourself with the room setup, make your presence known to the session chair, test out slides and audio, and address all issues with the student volunteer in the room. 
  You should pace your talk  carefully; time is of the essence and the program schedule will be strictly enforced. 
  You can find the length of your talk in the program  . 
  Subtract at least 5 minutes  from the allotted time to account for questions and set-up. 
  Talk slots for the main PLDI program are 20 minutes  , so presenters should aim to give a 15 minute talk  . 
  Talk slot lengths for workshops can be found on the respective workshop information pages. 
  If you do not want your talk to be either recorded or streamed, please indicate it in the questionnaire  . 
  Remote Presenters   
 Remote presentations are a little more complicated. You should double-check with your conference/workshop organizers that they are allowed in your track.  
 Please read the following instructions as they are crucial  for making sure your presentation goes as smoothly as possible!  
 Setting up Discord   
 Make sure you have a Discord account that is older than 5 minutes, with a | verified email address 
  Join the PLDI 2024 Discord server (check your email for the invite link) After joining the server, you should be prompted with a | Customisation Question | prompt. Please do the following: 
  Select the Presenter  role.    
 Go to Channels and Roles  .   
 Follow the Pre-Talk Sessions category.    
 Discord is now setup! If you have any technical issues or questions, please make sure to ask any questions in the #troubleshooting-chat  channel.   
 Pre-Session   
 On the day of your presentation, our remote volunteers will be performing several tests to make sure your presentation goes as smoothly as possible. Please join the Pre-Talk VC  channel up until 30 minutes before your scheduled presentation. There will be volunteers waiting in this channel 2 hours before the next scheduled remote presentation  . This means that if your talk is at 9 AM (Copenhagen time), there will be a volunteer in the channel from 7 AM.  
   
 If you are only joining Discord for the Q&A portion of your talk  (pre-recorded talks fall under this category), please join the Discord voice channel within the same timeline for the same tests.  
 Your Talk   
 Please join the Waiting Queue voice channel 30 minutes before your presentation.  A volunteer will promptly let you know 5 minutes before it is your time to present through the Waiting Queue chat:  
   
 When it is your time to present, the volunteer will move you to another voice channel. Here, you should be able to hear the session chair through Discord, from which you should follow their instructions for when to start presenting. When you are moved to this LIVE voice channel, please make sure to turn on your camera and screen-share  .  
 You can follow the livestream of current talks on the ACMSIGPLAN YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/@acmsigplan  .  
 If you have a pre-recorded talk  , you will still be moved to the voice channel during your talk (while your recording is playing). When your pre-recorded talk is done, you can conduct the Q&A segment by following your session chair’s instructions.  
 Troubleshooting   
 If at any point of the process there are technical issues (whether it is while presenting or during the pre-sessions) please join the Troubleshooting VC  channel under the Pre-Talk Sessions category. A volunteer will be there to assist you. If the volunteer assesses that the problem will take a considerable amount of time to solve, we will communicate with the session chair to move your talk to the next time-slot.  
 The communication between Speakers and Session Chairs will take place in the Troubleshooting VC  channel via the volunteers when technical difficulties occur.  
 Remote Presentations Summary   
 Please join the Discord voice channel titled Pre-Talk VC  within 2 hours before your talk. 
  30 minutes before your talk, join the Waiting Queue  voice channel and wait for your time-slot to commence. A volunteer will let you know 5 minutes before it is your time to present. 
  If there are any troubleshooting issues, join the Troubleshooting VC  channel and a volunteer will assist you.
