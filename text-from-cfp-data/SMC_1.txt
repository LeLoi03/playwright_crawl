 Overview  
 The 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society. It provides an international forum for researchers, educators, and practitioners to learn, share knowledge, report most recent innovations and developments, and exchange ideas and advances in all aspects of systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and cybernetics. The theme of the IEEE SMC 2025 conference is “Navigating Frontiers: Smart Systems for a Dynamic World”.  

 Submission Guidelines  
 Authors must adhere to the IEEE conference written paper format (including paper title, authors and affiliations, figures, and references) and they must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadlines (see dates below). These are submitted through the PaperCept submission system (see link above). IEEE is very strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.  We strongly recommend using the set of templates in MS Word  and LaTeX  format provided by IEEE. A4 page size should be used. Please use them to create your paper, but don’t modify the style or the format under any circumstances.  
 Submit only original work, not previously published or copyrighted. Prospective authors are expected to submit only their original works. The conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to help verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE’s publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, then disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE. For further details please have a look at the Conference Authors @ IEEE Author Center.   
 Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings, which will be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library  , once it meets the requirements of an IEEE quality review.  
 For paper or abstract submission, please use the template provided by the PaperCept system: https://conf.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl

 Paper Types  
 Regular Papers  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full-length papers electronically through the conference website. Papers (regular length of up to 6 pages) with max. 2 overlength pages (including paper title, authors and affiliations, figures, and references) for an extra fee should be concise but contain sufficient details and references to allow critical review. Papers will be reviewed (single-blinded) by at least two referees for technical merit and content.  
 Special Sessions Papers  
 Special Sessions provide a focused discussion of new and innovative topics. Special Session proposers should download the special session proposal template and submit the completed proposal to the Special Sessions Chairs. Special Session organizers should collect at least six papers. All submitted special session papers undergo the same review process as regular papers, and submission to proposed session is not a guarantee of acceptance.  
 Work-in-Progress and Industrial Papers  
 These contributions are intended to show work-in-progress and to promote contributions from industries on technology development, innovations, and implementations, which will facilitate collaboration between industrial and academic members of the SMC community. Such kind of papers describe research that have not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but limited to four (4) pages (total length including references). All submitted work-in-progress and industrial papers undergo the same review process as regular papers via submission page.  
 Workshop Papers  
 These contributions are intended to promote contributions from applied research and applications, including work in progress, and facilitate increased collaboration between industrial and academic members of the IEEE SMC community. All submitted workshop papers undergo the same review process as regular papers, and submission to proposed session is not a guarantee of acceptance.
