 Paper submission 

  ISORC has become established as the leading event devoted to state-of-the-art research in the field of object/component/service-oriented real-time distributed computing (ORC) technology that consider one or more ilities, such as performance, dependability, scalability, among others.  
  In addition to the main conference, ISORC 2025 will host a special session dedicated to posters and demos, where participants will be able to show prototypes, tools, simulators, and systems, which demonstrate the applicability of real-time computing to different applications.  
 Best Paper and Student Paper Awards will be delivered during the conference.

  Guidelines for Manuscripts   
 IEEE ISORC 2025 invites papers in three categories, all will be published in the IEEE proceeding. Submission guidelines for each category of paper are as follows:  
 Regular Research Papers:  Papers should describe original work and papers submitted for review should be a maximum of 10 pages in length, using the IEEE conference paper format. A maximum of two extra pages may be purchased during the camera-ready submission of accepted papers. 
  Industrial Papers and Practitioner Reports:  Papers describing experiences of using ORC technology in application or tool development projects, are an integral part of the technical program of ISORC. These papers should be no longer than 10 pages, using the IEEE conference paper format and may be less formal than research papers. A maximum of two extra pages may be purchased during the camera-ready submission of accepted papers. They should clearly identify and discuss in detail the issues that represent notable industrial advances. Reports with project metrics supporting their claims are particularly sought, as well as those that show both benefits and drawbacks of the approaches used in the given project. 
  Short Papers:  Short research papers that are no longer than 6 pages, using the IEEE conference paper format, on real-time analytics are also invited, and should contain enough information for the program committee to understand the scope of the project and evaluate the novelty of the problem or approach. 
  The IEEE conference paper templates  can be found here  .  
  
 Papers are to be submitted through the HotCRP system  .  
 Publication Information   
 All accepted submissions will appear in the proceedings published by IEEE. Each accepted paper shall be accompanied by at least one non-student registration.  One of the authors of the paper must attend and present their work at the conference. Failure to present the paper in person can lead to the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings. Please contact either Daniel Casini  , Pascal Berthou  , or Al Lail, Mustafa  if you have questions regarding the paper submissions. Organizers
