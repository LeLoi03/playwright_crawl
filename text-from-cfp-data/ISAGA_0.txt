 Global Simulation & Gaming Award  

               ©     

 In 2025, the annual ISAGA conference will be hosted in Germany, Stuttgart. As part of the conference we offer an award for final theses and dissertations in the field of simulation and gaming: The Global Simulation & Gaming Award.  
 With the Global Simulation & Gaming Award, we award outstanding final theses (e.g. bachelor, master) on issues dealing with simulation games. In addition, a prize is awarded for outstanding dissertations.  
 Our aim is to promote general access to mainly unpublished work regarding this topic, thereby contributing to the further development of simulation and gaming. The Global S&G Award is presented by the Centre for Management Simulation at DHBW Stuttgart in cooperation with ISAGA.
