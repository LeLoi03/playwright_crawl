 ACM Policy on Authorship and Generative AI Tools  
 We follow the ACM Policy on Authorship (approved by the ACM Publications Board on April 20, 2023) which state the following:  
   
  Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.. If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.  
   
  Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work. As the line between Generative AI tools and basic word processing systems like MS-Word or Grammarly becomes blurred, this Policy will be updated.  
   
  For further details and additional policies, please check the ACM website  and the related Frequently Asked Questions here  .   
 Revise and Resubmit Policy  
 Authors of papers submitted in the first round that have received a Revise and Resubmit recommendation are invited to submit a revision of their submission and a response to reviewers by the second submission deadline (November 22nd 2024). Note that author lists are not allowed to be changed after the review period has started. No new authors may be added during the revise and resubmit period, or for the camera-ready version due to potential conflicts of interest  (see ACM policy here  ).
