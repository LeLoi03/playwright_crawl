 ICMLA 2020 will be held entirely online  with reduced registration fees!     

  COVID-19 Pandemic Update  
    
 The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our highest priority. We are closely monitoring the current COVID-19 situation. Depending on the situation, we will either have the conference as planned in Miami, or as a virtual event. In addition, the accepted papers will have the option of virtual presentation with a reduced registration fees (virtual presentation papers will also be included in the conference proceedings)! We plan a high-quality paper presentation to enrich the interaction among all the presenters and attendees.    
  Scope of the Conference   
    
 ICMLA 2020 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to present their latest achievements and innovations in the area of machine learning (ML). The conference provides a leading international forum for the dissemination of original research in ML with emphasis on applications as well as novel algorithms and systems. Following the success of previous ICMLA conferences, the conference aims to attract researchers and application developers from a wide range of ML related areas, and the recent emergence of Big Data processing brings an urgent need for machine learning to address these new challenges.

  Applications of Machine Learning   
    
 The conference will cover both machine learning theoretical research and its applications. Contributions describing machine learning techniques applied to real-world problems and interdisciplinary research involving machine learning, in fields like medicine, biology, industry, manufacturing, security, education, virtual environments games, are especially encouraged.   

  Paper Submission   
    
 High quality papers in all Machine Learning areas are solicited. Papers that present new directions in ML will receive careful reviews. Authors are expected to ensure that their final manuscripts are original and are not appearing in other publications. Paper should be limited to 8 pages and submitted in IEEE format (double column). Papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, originality, significance and clarity. All submissions will be handled electronically. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, as a hardcopy. Authors of the accepted papers need to present their papers at the conference. A selected number of accepted papers will be invited for possible inclusion, in an expanded and revised form, in some journal special issues.  
   
  ICMLA'20 Best Paper Award and ICMLA'20 Best Poster Award will be conferred at the conference to the authors of the best research paper and best poster presentation, respectively, based on the reviewers and Programme Committee recommendations.
