 Research  
  
 In the last decade, more and more devices (such as mobile phones, smart meters, or RFID cards) have been designed and deployed in order to collect rich information about users and their environment. While primarily targeting to offer tailored services and innovative applications, such data collection inherently also represents a danger to user privacy. Often, sensitive information can be inferred from the data easily, such as users’ whereabouts or fine-grained activity information.  
 In the context of this application domain, our research is primarily focused on the following points:  
 Exploring threats to privacy 
  Increasing the users’ awareness of these threats 
  Developing countermeasures to preserve user privacy 
  Understanding the factors that motivate users to reveal sensitive information 
  Empowering users to protect their privacy by providing innovative and usable methods 
  Our general research interests are privacy, anonymity and pseudonymity, trust and reputation, and usability in computer networks.
