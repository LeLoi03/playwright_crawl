 Theme: Curious Minds  

 This is the first time SIGGRAPH Asia in Tokyo will present an Art Papers program! The conference theme, “Curious Minds,” applies to both artists exploring new technologies and critics evaluating their effectiveness and meaning. Following our curiosity, we artists have misused systems, hacked devices, devised unusual algorithms and processes, and expressed new colors and forms. What motivates our curiosity, and what are the consequences of our efforts? Why obsess over something that no one else seems to care about, or doesn’t have immediate or practical value? Why do something that someone else finds disturbing? Why here and now? Why you? What roles do artists and critics have in shaping the future of computer graphics and interactive techniques?   

 Join us in Tokyo this December as we delve into the complex tapestry of Curious Minds. Explore how technology can both disrupt and unify, offering new ways to understand and engage with our multifaceted existence and curiosity. Be part of the conversation and connect with the vibrant SIGGRAPH arts community here: Digital Arts Community (DAC) Of SIGGRAPH Asia.
