 26th International Conference on Agile Software Development  
   
 XP 2025 • Brugg-Windisch, Switzerland • June 2-5, 2025   
  We welcome the XP community for the first time in Switzerland  !   
 XP is the premier agile software development conference, that combines, both, research and practice. It is a unique forum where agile researchers, practitioners, thought leaders, coaches, and trainers gather to present and discuss their most recent innovations and research results. At its inception, 26 years ago, the XP conference focused solely on eXtreme Programming. It quickly widened its scope to include all modern agile approaches and all the developing aspects of agility. XP draws people from around the globe, providing a diverse and inclusive environment for learning and inspiring conversations.  
 What matters to you?   
 In just a few years, AI tools have been widely adopted by industry and their capabilities have improved enormously. Together with other trends such as platform engineering, conversational applications, sustainable development, and many more, the way we develop, operate, and evolve software may change drastically. At the same time, with the digital revolution, software has become part of the critical infrastructure of the entire economy; software is a core asset of many companies and is responsible for their success.  
 How can these trends and new research support and enhance agile software development and its operation in the future? Are the agile values and principles described in the manifesto still valid and/or sufficient?  
 What other trends, innovations, and research do you see emerging in the development and operation of valuable software products? Do you want to help shape the future of software development? Do you have ideas, and solutions or have you done experiments and research to solve a specific problem?  
  Call for Submissions   
 For XP 2025, we are interested in talks and papers, especially those on this year’s theme:  
 Adapt - Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products
