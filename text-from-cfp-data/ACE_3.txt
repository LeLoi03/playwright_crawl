  Presentation Formats  
   Oral Presentation (25 minutes)   
 This is the standard presentation format. In an oral presentation the presenter delivers their research to their audience verbally, often accompanied by a PowerPoint slideshow. Oral presentations are generally organised by stream into parallel sessions comprising three or four presentations.  

   Poster Presentation (60 minutes)   
 A poster presentation provides a relaxed presentation atmosphere in which the presenter uses a poster pinned to a poster board (1800mm high by 900mm wide) to illustrate their research. Presenters will often engage with interested participants on a one-to-one basis, providing excellent opportunities for networking, discussion and relationship building. A Virtual Poster Presentation option is also available as an alternative means for those delegates who may be unable to travel to the conference due to financial or political restrictions.  

   Live-Stream Presentation via Zoom (25 minutes)   
 Many people around the world are moving meetings, classrooms and events online, and IAFOR is now offering the option to present online, via Zoom. This is an exciting new opportunity for scholars around the world to engage with an international audience without the need to travel. Live-stream presentations give speakers the opportunity to avoid expenses and time required to travel, reduce their carbon footprint, and share ideas online. Additionally, many of the same benefits enjoyed by presenters at traditional in-person conferences are also available to online presenters, including presenting one’s work to an international audience and engaging in Q&A, publishing in the Conference Proceedings, and participating in discussions with other scholars around the world.  

   Virtual Presentation (Pre-Recorded Video or Pre-submitted Poster)   
 Two presentation options are available:  
  1) Virtual Video Presentation – Present via a pre-recorded video.  
  2) Virtual Poster Presentation – Submit a poster and optionally present your poster with a 3-minute introductory video.  
 Virtual presentations afford authors the opportunity to present their research to IAFOR’s far-reaching and international online audience, without time restrictions, distractions or the need to travel. Presenters are invited to create a video of their presentation, which is then uploaded to the official IAFOR Vimeo channel  and remains online indefinitely. This is a valuable and impactful way of presenting in its own right, but also an alternative means for those delegates who may be unable to travel to the conference due to financial or political restrictions. The same publishing opportunities apply to virtual presenters, with final papers being included in the Conference Proceedings  .  
 Following the conference virtual presenters will receive a Certificate of Presentation 
  The Vimeo channel will be referenced on all conference materials. 
  There is no limit to length or style but certain restrictions apply to file size and music selection. Guidelines and further information on creating the video will be sent following registration. 
  Please note that video presentations are to be created by the author. 

   Workshop Presentation (50 minutes)   
 A workshop is a brief, intensive course, lasting 50 minutes, which is led by an experienced researcher or practitioner, usually with a PhD-level qualification. It facilitates group interaction and the exchange of information between a smaller number of participants than is usual at a plenary session.  
 Often a workshop involves problem-solving, skills training, or the dissemination of new content or disciplinary approaches. Conference workshops are typically more instructional and interactive in nature than oral presentations and involve participants working with the workshop leader on a particular topical issue.  

   Symposium Presentations (75 minutes)   
 Symposium presentations are conceived and organised by individuals who recruit speakers to present papers on a specific topic. Presenters should submit their own abstracts separately before a Symposium Presentation can be proposed. Presenters may submit separate papers to the Conference Proceedings  . The organiser will require a Submission Number from each accepted presenter in order to propose a Symposium Presentation.  
  They last for 75 minutes and are typically organised as follows:  
 Introduction 
  3 or 4 oral presentations based on submitted abstracts 
  Discussion 

   Panel Presentations (75 minutes)   
 Panel presentations are conceived and organised by individuals who recruit speakers to present in an interactive discussion on a specific topic. There are no titles associated with the panelists’ presentations. Proposals for panel discussions should include clear descriptions of the topics to be discussed. Presenters may submit a joint paper to the Conference Proceedings. They last for 75 minutes and are typically organised as follows:  
 Introduction 
  a short presentation by each panel member 
  Discussion 
  As the organiser of a proposed panel, submit your proposal through the online system  . Presenters may submit a joint paper to the Conference Proceedings  .  

  Review System  
 Authors as Reviewers: A Reciprocal System  
 Our academic events would not be what they are without a commitment to ensuring adherence to international norms of abstract peer review. IAFOR relies on a large number of international scholars from around the world to contribute to a shared vision of promoting and engaging in international, intercultural and interdisciplinary dialogue, and if you are taking part in an IAFOR event, then that would mean you. Authors may be asked to review up to five abstracts for the conference. You are under no obligation to participate in this reciprocal system, but if you are selected to review, and undertake this task of grading abstracts for the conference, you will be credited in the conference programme.  
  Scheduling Requests  
 Because of the complexity of putting the Conference Programme together and the large numbers of participants involved, it is not usually possible to accommodate requests for specific presentation days or times. We ask that you reserve requests for religious reasons or other exceptional and unavoidable circumstances.  
 We encourage participants to attend the conference each day in order to benefit fully from the experience. While requests for specific presentation days or times are not accepted other than under exceptional circumstances, you may request one blackout day – a day on which you will not be scheduled to present at the conference.  
 Scheduling requests will not be accepted after the registration deadline.   
  Conference Proceedings  
 If you wish your paper to be published in the Conference Proceedings, once you have registered please ensure that you upload your full paper through the online system by January 15, 2025  .  
 Final papers are only accepted in Microsoft Word format. Before submitting your paper please ensure that you have read the Final Paper Guidelines  and formatted your paper correctly.  
 The official Conference Proceedings will be published online in a PDF format under an ISSN issued by the National Diet Library of Japan  on February 22, 2025  .
