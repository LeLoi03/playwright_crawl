   Welcome to the website of the 46th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2019).  
 The annual Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation or application of programming languages.  
 The symposium is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.  
 POPL 2019 and its co-located events took place at the Hotel Cascais Miragem, Cascais, Portugal  , January 13–19, 2019.
