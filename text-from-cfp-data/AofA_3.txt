   Education  
  
 I did my PhD degree at the Department of Computer Science  of the University of Toronto  . My first supervisor was Joachim von zur Gathen  , and after he moved to Paderborn I finished the thesis under the supervision of Rudi Mathon  .  
 After my PhD was completed, I spent some few months at the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization  of the University of Waterloo  . At Waterloo, I had a posdoc position with Bruce Richmond.  
  
 My master's degree was done under the supervision of Arnaldo Mandel  at the Department of Computer Science  , Institute of Mathematics and Statistics  , Universidade de Sao Paulo  , Sao Paulo  , Brazil  .  
  
 I did my undergraduate studies at the Institute of Computing  of the Faculty of Engineering  , and at the Center of Mathematics  of the Faculty of Sciences  , both of the Universidad de la Republica  , Montevideo  , Uruguay  .
