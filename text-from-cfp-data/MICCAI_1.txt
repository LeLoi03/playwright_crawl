 The MICCAI conference will take place this year in Daejeon, South Korea. This venue epitomizes global collaboration, interdisciplinary initiatives, and scientific diversity in medical image computing and computer-assisted interventions.  
 In addition to exploring the latest advancements in the field, MICCAI 2025 will highlight translational solutions to real-world clinical challenges. The theme "From Concept to Clinical” will include special sessions devoted to clinical translation, many of which have been successfully established over the last two years, clinical tutorials for engineers, and live demonstrations from local and international start-ups. Drawing inspiration from the vibrant city of Daejeon, MICCAI 2025 will emphasize a pan-Asian connection by facilitating community discussion, broadcasting to researchers in nearby countries, and highlighting the needs of underrepresented countries in Asia.  
 We welcome engineers, scientists, health practitioners, industry actors, policymakers and researchers at all career levels from across the globe to take part in this new MICCAI edition. Join us in Daejeon, a hub of science and technology in the center of South Korea for an invigorating and memorable scientific gathering.  
 Topics of interest for MICCAI 2025 include, but are not limited to:   
 Image formation and reconstruction 
  Image segmentation and anomaly detection 
  Integration of imaging and non-imaging data 
  Multimodal data integration and analysis 
  Computer-aided diagnosis
