 Call For Papers 
 SCOPE  
   
  Java programming is multi-faceted, covering a rich diversity of systems, tools, frameworks and techniques. PPPJ provides a forum for researchers, practitioners and educators to present and discuss novel results on all aspects of Java programming including the language and its virtual machine, methods, tools, frameworks, libraries, case studies, and experience reports. We invite papers on all these aspects. Topics include but are not limited to:  
   
  The Java Language and Systems  
  Software Engineering with Java  
  Mobile and Embedded Devices, e.g., Java Micro Edition, Android  
  Other Static, Dynamic, and Functional Languages for the JVM  
  VM Design and Optimization  
  Aspect-oriented Programming in Java  
  Modular Programming with Java  
  Model-driven Development in Java  
  Real-Time Systems in Java  
  Component- and Service-oriented Architectures  
  Java Frameworks and Tools  
  Java and Formal Methods  
  Security and Information Flow  
  Testing, Analysis, and Metrics  
  Java Concurrency  
  Parallelization of Java Programs  
  Applications in Science, Engineering, and Business  
  Java Practice and Experience Reports  
  Teaching Java  
   
  SUBMISSION GUIDELINES  
   
  All papers must represent original and unpublished work that is not currently under review. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the conference.  
   
  At least one author of each accepted paper is required to attend the conference and present the paper.  
   
  Two types of paper submissions will be accepted:  
   
  research/industry/experience papers, as well as  
  tool demonstration papers.  
   
  Research/industry/experience papers must not exceed 10 pages, while tool demonstration papers must not exceed 4 pages. The title of tool demonstration papers should start with "Tool Demonstration:" in order to identify the paper type. Please number the pages. The conference proceedings will be published as part of the ACM International Proceedings Series and will be disseminated through the ACM Digital Library. We also plan to invite the authors of the best papers to provide an extended version for a special issue of Elsevier Science of Computer Programming. The required format for the submission is the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings Style, using 9-point font size. A link to the author information containing the Latex and Word templates can be found on the conference webpage. Please apply the ACM Computing Classification categories and terms (links to these are also on the conference webpage).
