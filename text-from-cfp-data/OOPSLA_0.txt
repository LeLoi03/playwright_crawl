 Welcome to the website of the joint ICFP/SPLASH 2025 conference!  
 For the first time, the two leading SIGPLAN venues—ICFP and SPLASH—will be co-located in Singapore in 2025:  
 ICFP 2025  : The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) is an annual programming language conference that provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work, from practice to theory, including its peripheries. 
  SPLASH 2025  : The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery, to make it the premier conference on the applications of programming languages - at the intersection of programming languages and software engineering. 
  We couldn’t be more excited to host academics and practitioners from all around the globe in one of the most vibrant and safe cities in the world!
