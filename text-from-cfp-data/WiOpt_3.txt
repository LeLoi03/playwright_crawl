 Call for Papers  
 The 22nd International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt 2024) aims to bring together state-of-the-art research contributions from different fields in networks. It welcomes original and high-quality paper submissions related to modeling, performance evaluation and optimization of networks. The focus includes mobile networks, social networks, vehicular networks, content-driven networks, cloud and edge computing systems, Internet of Things, quantum networks, AI/ML-enhanced networks, etc. We encourage both theoretical contributions and real world empirical measurements and experimental studies.  
 The areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
 Modeling, model validation and performance analysis 
  Cross-layer design and optimization / control 
  Scaling laws and fundamental limits 
  Network architectures and protocol design 
  Resource optimization 
  Network economics and pricing 
  Game theory for networks 
  Quality of Service solutions 
  Energy efficiency, harvesting, power control and management 
  Security, trust, and privacy 
  Network resilience, anomaly detection, and reliability analysis 
  Data collection and analytics for networks 
  Edge and Fog computing, Mobile and Cloud computing 
  Content distribution networks and wireless caching 
  Reflective intelligent surface for communication networks 
  Machine learning techniques for wireless communications and networking 
  UAV communications in 5G and Beyond Networks 
  Integrated sensing and communication 
  Semantic and goal-oriented communications, and age of information 
  Distributed computation, communication-computation tradeoffs 
  Distributed and federated machine learning over heterogeneous networks 
  Human-centric communication and networking for Metaverse 
  Design and Analysis of Quantum Networks 
  WiOpt 2024 will give one Best Paper Award and one Best Student Paper Award. For the Best Student Paper Award, the first author of the paper needs to be a full-time student at the time of paper submission. A selected set of papers will be offered the opportunity for a Fast-Track submission of an extended version to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking or IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering. WiOpt 2024 will have the technical co-sponsorship of the IEEE Control Systems Society and of the IEEE Information Theory Society, and the support of IFIP. The copyright of published papers belongs to IFIP, which implements a free open access policy: authors effectively hold the copyright of their papers, and IFIP automatically grants authors permissions to reuse the material as they wish. The published papers will be available in the Digital Library of IFIP at no cost neither to authors nor to readers, and will also be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. WiOpt has longstanding associated workshops, and these workshops’ CFP for 2024 will be announced separately.
