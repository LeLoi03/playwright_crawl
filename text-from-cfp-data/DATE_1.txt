  Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference  
 The European Event for Electronic System Design & Test  
 Palais des congrès de Lyon, Lyon, France  , 31 March - 2 April 2025  
 Call for Papers  
 Scope of the Event  
 The 28 th  DATE conference is the main European event bringing together designers and design automation users, researchers and vendors as well as specialists in hardware and software design, test and manufacturing of electronic circuits and systems. DATE puts strong emphasis on both technology and systems, covering ICs/SoCs, emerging technologies, embedded systems and embedded software.  
 Structure of the Event  
 The multi-day event consists of a conference with keynote talks, regular papers, panels, hot-topic sessions, tutorials, workshops, special focus days and a track for executives. The organisation of user group meetings, fringe meetings, a Young People Programme, vendor presentations and social events offers a wide variety of extra opportunities to meet and exchange information on relevant issues for the design automation, design and test communities. Special space will also be allocated for multi-partner innovative research projects to show their results. More details will be available on the DATE website: https://www.date-conference.com  .  
 Areas of Interest  
 Within the scope of the conference, the main areas of interest are: design automation, design tools and hardware architectures for electronic and embedded systems; test and dependability at system, chip, circuit and device level for analogue and digital electronics; modelling, analysis, design and deployment of embedded software and cyber-physical systems; application design and industrial design experiences.
