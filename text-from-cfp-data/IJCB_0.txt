 Call For Papers  Tom Duhamel    2024-09-11T06:19:57-04:00  T-BIOM Call For Papers  
 IEEE Biometrics Council is pleased to announce the launch of IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science (T-BIOM)  . It will be a quarterly Transactions and the first issue will be published in January 2019. T-BIOM  publishes original articles on all aspects of biometrics (i.e. recognizing people through their physiological or behavioral traits such as face, fingerprint, iris, and signature), including theory, applications, systems, and surveys. Biometrics are personal identity characteristics where people are recognized by who they are rather than by what they own; behavior is the typical movement of a person that is unique and identifiable; identity science underlies the application of biometrics. Papers focusing on ramifications of these areas will also be welcomed, such as security of such systems, standards for their deployment, and new architectures and systems are also welcomed. Broad topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
 Biometric modalities | Management of human identities using traditional behavioral and physiological characteristics (biometric modalities) including Face, Fingerprint, Iris, Periocular, Palmprint, Gait, Ear, and Voice. 
  Emerging biometrics including social and behavioral biometrics, gesture based biometrics, keystroke, vascular, knuckle, and soft information/biometrics such as quality, age, gender, kinship, social context, and biographic analysis 
  Multibiometrics including fusion approaches 
  Novel biometric sensors 
  Person re-identification 
  Detection, tracking, identification, and de-identification in surveillance 
  Mobile biometrics, active authentication 
  Novel (challenging) biometrics databases, protocol and benchmarking, large scale evaluation, confidence interval estimation, and performance modeling and prediction 
  Pattern classification and machine learning, including deep learning, algorithms for biometrics and identity science 
  Behavior analysis related to biometrics and identity science: | Biometrics and human behavior analysis, human activity understanding, and behavior modeling 
  Modeling the interplay of behavioral modalities with applications in biometrics and security 
  Security of biometrics and identity systems: | Adversarial attacks on biometric systems 
  Biometrics presentation attack detection, template protection, template update, and data protection 
  Applications: | Forensic analysis in identity and activity 
  Applications of biometrics and identity in privacy preserving computing, user centric security, usable privacy and security, social and criminal network inference, privacy protection and enhancement 
  Applications of biometrics in law enforcement and cybercrime, finance, smart-cards, border control, healthcare, civil registry, access control, securing documents, fraud detection, cloud, and entertainment.
