  Production efficiency, good paper profiles, reduced energy consumption and cost savings are common targets for all paper makers. Besides these, also providing the best possible customer satisfaction for end product users is crucial on today’s demanding markets. Intelligent roll – “iRoll” product family aims at these goals and provides a solution for improving sheet quality, optimizing nip ... [Show full abstract]  profiles and for assuring highest possible end product runnability. The intelligent “iRoll” product family is a complete set of tools for controlling paper tension and nip profiles. Intelligent rolls can be utilized for all main processes and positions of paper machines. “iRoll” technology enables to improve production efficiency and product quality by assuring optimal runnability in all process phases. Use of intelligent roll technology offers cost savings by improved nip profiles, parent roll hardness profiles and tension profiles as well as best possible product for printing and converting houses. This paper introduces the applications of intelligent roll technology in paper, board and tissue making and illustrates the benefits through example cases.
