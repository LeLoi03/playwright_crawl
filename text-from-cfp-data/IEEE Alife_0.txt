  Emerging Researchers in ALife 

 Welcome to Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA)   

 We are the student chapter of ISAL, committed to fostering the next generation of Artificial Life researchers. ERA  brings together a diverse and dynamic community of emerging researchers, offering a space to connect, collaborate, and contribute to the exciting field of Artificial Life.  
 Since our founding in 2016, ERA  has been at the forefront of supporting early-career scientists—whether you’re a PhD student, postdoctoral researcher, or an independent scholar. We provide opportunities to engage with the broader Artificial Life community, including hosting an annual workshop at the flagship Artificial Life Conference  , where emerging researchers can network, share ideas, and build lasting professional relationships.  
   
 Our definition of “emerging researcher” is inclusive—if you see yourself as one, you’re part of our community!
