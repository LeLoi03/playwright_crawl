 Call for Papers  

 PDP is among the prime European and International conferences covering all aspects of parallel and distributed  processing, ranging from theory to practice, from small to the largest parallel and distributed systems and infrastructures, from fundamental computational problems to full-fledged applications, from architecture, compiler,  language and interface design and implementation, to tools, support infrastructures, and application performance aspects.   

 Submit your work      

 Conference Topics  

 We invite submissions of high-quality, novel and original research results in areas of parallel and distributed computing including but not limited to:   
   
 Algorithms:  resource-aware and power-efficient algorithms; real-time and fault-tolerant distributed/parallel algorithms; graph and network algorithms   
   
 Applications:  numerical and scientific applications with multi-level parallelism; applications with computations over irregular domains; models and methods to enhance functional/non-functional application characteristics  
 Data-centric Processing:  scientific workflows; large-scale data processing; large-scale data management; scalable and next-generation storage systems; I/O performance tuning, benchmarking, and middleware; FAIR/open data systems   
 Distributed AI:  Federated Learning; Distributed Learning; AI at scale; training of LLMs; benchmarking for AI workloads  
 Distributed Computing:  cluster, grid, fog/edge, mobile and cloud systems; Service-oriented processing; stochastic and approximate computing; cost, security, energy, and other non-functional requirements models and frameworks   
 Parallel Computing:  accelerator-based systems inc. GPU, FPGA, neuromorphic, and post-CMOS devices; embedded parallel systems; dependability, survivability, and fault-tolerance; methodologies, benchmarking/metrics, and performance analysis and tools   
 Programming Models and Tools:  programming languages, compilers, middleware, and OS; libraries, runtime, and systems software; notations; performance prediction and analysis; simulation and modeling of parallel/distributed systems   
 HPC state of practice:  Managing systems and storage; managing facilities; HPC project management; moving, managing and sharing data HPC in the cloud; networking and cybersecurity; HPC training and education strategies; application workflows; system benchmarking   
 Systems and Architectures:  high data throughput and streaming architectures; memory organization; service-oriented architectures; heterogeneous and hybrid systems; resource management; post-CMOS architectures including quantum, neuromorphic, and others   
 The conference will feature contributed and invited talks. Co-located Special Sessions are also planned as usual for PDP.

 Submission Guidelines  

 Submissions must be in PDF format and should not exceed 8 pages for long papers and 4 pages for short contributions. The page limit includes  references and authors’ biographies.  
   
 All  submissions must follow the IEEE Conference proceedings format (IEEEtran, double-column, 10pt) at   https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html.    
 At submission time, the authors must choose the type of submission, indicating whether they intend to submit to the Main track or a specific Special Session.  The review process is double-blind and all papers need to be “best-effort” anonymized. We strongly encourage making code and data available anonymously (e.g., in an anonymous GitHub repository via Anonymous GitHub  or in a Dropbox folder).   
 Submissions will be evaluated by at least three reviewers based on relevance, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. All accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings volume published by Conference Publishing Services (  https://ieeecps.org  ). At least one author of an accepted paper must register for the conference and present in person their paper at the conference venue in Turin.   
 Submissions should be made through the CMT system at the following link  .
