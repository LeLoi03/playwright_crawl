 About Spotlights and call for Spotlight authors  

 What are Spotlights?  
  
  SPIE Spotlights are concise, digital-only publications, led by Series Editor Craig Olson (L3Harris Technologies Inc.), that either summarize a broad topic or highlight a specific niche. Over 45 highly informative Spotlight eBooks have been published so far to great reception.  
  The time commitment to write a Spotlight is significantly less than a traditional book, allowing you to reap the benefits of authorship without an extended time commitment.  
 Each Spotlight is:  
 30-60 pages of concise, focused material 
  Rapidly published using a streamlined submission and production process 
  Peer reviewed 
  Included in the eBooks program on the SPIE Digital Library, with a large number of major subscribing institutions worldwide 
  A source of author royalties like our traditional books - get paid for your eBook sales and downloads 
  SPIE is seeking submissions for Spotlight eBooks on the following topics:  
 Aerospace and Defense Technologies | – Associate Editor Keith Kasunic (Optical Systems Group) 
  Biomedical Optics and Medical Imaging | – Associate Editor Brian Sorg (National Cancer Institute) 
  Energy and the Environment | – Associate Editor Wei Li (Stanford Univ.) 
  Optical Design and Engineering | - Ronian Siew (InOpticalSolutions) 
  Semiconductor, Nano-, and Quantum Technology | - Stefan Preble (Rochester Institute of Technology), and Richard Blaikie (University of Otago) 
  Please submit a proposal  for topical discussions and tutorials, noting that your submission is intended for a Spotlight e-Book on one of the topics above. If you have an idea for a different topic, feel free to submit a proposal or contact Technical Content & Scientific Publishing Manager, Matt Jungwirth  .
