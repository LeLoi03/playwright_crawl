 Paper Submission  
  
 Authors are invited to submit papers electronically, following the link bellow.  
 All manuscripts will be peer-reviewed and will be evaluated on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, quality of presentation, and relevance to the conference topics. 
  Submissions need to be double-blinded. Authors should not reveal their identity in their submissions. References to past work need to be in a third-person form. 
  Submitted manuscripts should not exceed 10 letter size pages (8.5 x 11, IEEE format for conference proceedings), including figures, tables and references. 
  Original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal is expected. Papers determined to be under active review elsewhere will be rejected without review. 
  IEEE | Submission and Peer Review Policies | should be read and understood before submission. Special care to timely topics like | “Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text” | is given. 
  Submissions received after the due date, exceeding the length limit will not be considered. 
  The proceedings will be published through the IEEE Press and will be made available online through the IEEE Digital Library. 
  When submitting the final accepted manuscript, authors may purchase up to two additional pages beyond the original 10 pages (excluding references) to address comments received from the reviewers.
