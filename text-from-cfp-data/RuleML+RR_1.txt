 Call Summary    
  
 The 8th International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning (RuleML+RR 2024) is the leading international joint conference in the field of rule-based reasoning. One of the main goals of RuleML+RR is to build bridges between academia and industry in the area of semantic reasoning.   
 RuleML+RR 2024 aims to bring together rigorous researchers and inventive practitioners, interested in the foundations and applications of rules and reasoning. It provides a forum for stimulating cooperation and cross-fertilization between different communities focused on the research, development, and applications of rule-based systems. We are looking for high-quality papers related to theoretical advances, novel technologies, and artificial intelligence applications that involve rule-based representation and reasoning.   
 The RuleML+RR 2024 conference is part of the event “Declarative AI: Rules, Reasoning, Decisions, and Explanations” and is co-located with  DecisionCAMP 2024   and the  Reasoning Web Summer School   . Apart from the main track, it features the  Rule Challenge   , a  Doctoral Consortium   , an  Industry Track   , and a  Project Networking Session   as associated events.   

 Topics    
  
 RuleML+RR welcomes research from all areas of Rules and Reasoning. The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:   
 Ontology/Semantic Web   
 Vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules 
  Ontology-based mediated query answering 
  Rules for knowledge graphs creation and interoperation 
  Rules for knowledge graph embeddings and ontology learning 
  Rule-based data integration 
  Data management and data interoperability for web data 
  Distributed agent-based systems for the web 
  Rules for AI and AI for Rules   
 Rule-based approaches to natural language processing 
  Applications of rule technologies with explainable AI (xAI) elements 
  Machine learning approaches involving rules 
  Explainable AI approaches based on rules 
  FAIRness approaches based on rules 
  Rule-based approaches for intelligent systems and intelligent information access 
  Rules and Reasoning / Logics

  Description Logics, existential rules 
  Higher-order and modal rules 
  Constraint programming 
  Logic programming, ASP, and datalog 
  Rule based argumentation 
  Rule-based approaches to agents and multi-agent systems 
  Reasoning with incomplete, inconsistent and uncertain data 
  Non-monotonic, common-sense, and closed-world reasoning

  Scalability and expressive power of logics for the Semantic Web 
  Scalability and expressive power of logics for rules 
  Data quality and benchmarks 
  Rules and Interoperability   
 Rule markup languages, rule interchange formats, and rule standards 
  Rule-based policies, reputation, and trust 
  Rules and human language technology 
  System Descriptions, Applications and Experiences of Ontologies and Rules in   
 Climate change monitoring, mitigation & adaptation 
  Environmental protection 
  Agriculture and agri-food 
  Healthcare and life sciences 
  Equity and social welfare 
  Law, regulation, and finance 
  Digital Twins 
  Industrial contexts

 Submission and Publication    
  
 High-quality papers related to theoretical advances, novel technologies, and artificial intelligence applications concerning explainable algorithmic decision-making that involve rule-based representation and reasoning are solicited.   
 We accept the following submission formats for papers:   
 Long papers (up to 15 pages in   LNCS style   including references) 
  Short papers (up to 8 pages in   LNCS style   including references) 
   
  Long papers should present original and significant research and/or development results. Short papers should concisely describe general results or specific applications, systems, or position statements. All submissions must be prepared in Springer's LNCS style (  http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html   ).   
  
  Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with formal proceedings. Double submission to a workshop with informal proceedings is allowed. Papers put on arXiv are also allowed as long as they are not refereed (i.e., formally reviewed by peers).   
  
  Submissions to the RuleML+RR conference   
  
  have the page limit of 15 (/8) pages including references 
  are not anonymous 
  can have additional material included as an external report (appendices to the submission are not permitted and a paper should be self-contained) 
   
  Papers should be written in English can be submitted using EasyChair:   
  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rulemlrr2024     
  
  The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS) after the conference.  The best papers will be considered for special issues of the   Theory and Practice of Logic Programming   or the   Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge   journals.   
  
  The best paper will be awarded the the RuleML+RR Harold Boley Distinguished Paper Award 2024 and best student paper will be awarded the RuleML+RR Best Student Paper Award 2024.
