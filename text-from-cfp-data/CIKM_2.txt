 The Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) provides a unique venue for industry and academia to present and discuss state-of-the-art research on artificial intelligence, search and discovery, data mining, and database systems, all at a single conference. CIKM is uniquely situated to highlight technologies and insights that materialize the big data and artificial intelligence vision of the future. CIKM 2024 will take place between October 21-25, 2024 in Boise, Idaho, USA.

 Topics of Interest   
 We encourage submissions of high-quality research papers on the general areas of artificial intelligence, data science, databases, information retrieval, and knowledge management. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following areas:   
 Data and information acquisition and preprocessing (e.g., data crawling, IoT data, data quality, data privacy, mitigating biases, data wrangling) 
  Integration and aggregation (e.g., semantic processing, data provenance, data linkage, data fusion, knowledge graphs, data warehousing, data lake, privacy and security, modeling, information credibility) 
  Efficient data processing (e.g., serverless, data-intensive computing, database systems, indexing and compression, architectures, distributed data systems, dataspaces, customized hardware) 
  Special data processing (e.g., multilingual text, sequential, stream, time series, spatio-temporal, (knowledge) graph, multimedia, scientific, and social media data) 
  Analytics and machine learning (e.g., OLAP, data mining, machine learning and AI, scalable analysis algorithms, algorithmic biases, event detection, and tracking, understanding, and interpretability) 
  Neural Information and knowledge processing (e.g., graph neural networks, domain adaptation, transfer learning, network architectures, neural ranking, neural recommendation, and neural prediction) 
  Data preparation, Valuation, and Trading 
  Information access and retrieval (e.g., web search, question answering and dialogue systems, retrieval models, query processing, personalization, recommender, and filtering systems) 
  Users and interfaces for information systems (e.g., user behavior analysis, user interface design, perception of biases, personalization, interactive information retrieval, interactive analysis, spoken interfaces) 
  Evaluation, performance studies, and benchmarks (e.g., online and offline evaluation, best practices) 
  Crowdsourcing (e.g. task assignment, worker reliability, optimization, trustworthiness, transparency, best practices) 
  Mining multi-modal content (e.g., natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, content understanding, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs, and knowledge representations) 
  Data presentation (e.g., visualization, summarization, readability, VR, speech input/output) 
  Applications (e.g., urban systems, biomedical and health informatics, legal informatics, crisis informatics, computational social science, data-enabled discovery, social media) 
  Knowledge graphs support data representation and manipulation 
  Generation of knowledge graphs using unstructured data 
  Information retrieval in the era of LLMs 
  Open-ended QA systems 
  Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics, and Explainability in Information and Knowledge Management 
    
 Paper Submissions   
 Authors are invited to submit original, full-length research papers that are not previously published, accepted to be published, or being considered for publication in any other forum. Full-length papers should satisfy the standard requirements of top-tier international research conferences.   
 Manuscripts should be submitted to CIKM 2024 Easychair site in PDF format, using the 2-column ACM sigconf template, see  https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template   . Full papers cannot exceed 9 pages, including an appendix, plus unlimited references (paper content is limited to 9 pages, that means that if you have an appendix, then it should be included within that page limit. It is also ok if you do not have an appendix and instead 9 pages of content). Rejected full papers will not be considered for publication as short papers. The review of manuscripts will be double-blind, and submissions not properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review.   
 Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless this produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. AI tools may be used to edit and polish authors’ work, such as using LLMs for light editing of their text (e.g., automate grammar checks, word autocorrect, and other editing of author-written text), but text “produced entirely” by generative/AI models is not allowed.   
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the work on-site in Boise, Idaho, USA, as scheduled in the conference program.   
 The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.   

 Dual Submission Policy   
 Submitting papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences (or any venue with published proceedings) is not allowed  . However, it is allowed to make an abstract submission by May 13, 2024 ( without uploading the paper PDF  ) for a paper that is still under review as long as the ongoing review process ends by the full paper final deadline of May 20, 2024  . You need to withdraw your submission in case the paper is accepted or still under review by May 20, 2024.  
 Authors are allowed to submit papers that have been presented or are to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Authors may also submit anonymized work already available as a preprint (e.g., in arXiv). In this case, the authors must modify the title and abstract while refraining from citing the manuscript to preserve anonymity.   
 Authorship Policy   
 Before paper submission, authors are advised to review  ACM’s authorship policy   carefully. Please ensure that all authors are identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To help reviewers identify potential conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified by the abstract submission deadline. Consequently, no changes to authorship will be allowed under any circumstance after the abstract submission deadline; neither update will be permitted for camera-ready versions.   
 ACM Conflict of Interest Policy   
 All authors must adhere to the ACM Conflict of Interest policy. For full details, please visit this site: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest   
 Desk Rejection Policy   
 Submissions that fail to adhere to the anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty—such as plagiarism, author misrepresentation, or falsification—may be subject to desk rejection by the chairs.   
 ACM Policy Against Harassment   
 All authors and participants must adhere to the ACM Policy Against Harassment. For full details, please visit this site:
