 Description   
 Students are the lifeblood of ISIF and the future of information fusion. Tammy Blair played a key role in the organizing committee for multiple FUSION conferences and was passionate about involving students. Tammy died in San Diego, California during the week following the 2009 FUSION conference, where she contracted the Swine Flu. The Tammy Blair Best Student Paper Award encourages the involvement of young researchers and scientists in information fusion. It honors Tammy Blair's commitment to ISIF and her efforts to involve students in the annual FUSION conference.
