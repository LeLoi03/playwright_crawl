 Call for Papers    

 VINCI'24 includes tracks of  Technical Papers  ,  Art Papers  , and  Art and Media Galleries  . All accepted papers will be included in the  ACM Proceedings   as formal publications and EI-indexed.  Selected papers will be invited to be extended for publication i  n special issues of  PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality   (  SCI-indexed; MIT Press; 3-4 papers for fast-tracked review in 2 months  ) and   International Journal of Digital Media Design   (  Taiwan Humanities Core Index  )  .  We solicit original, unpublished research papers that focus on all aspects of visual information communication and interaction, either via images, computer graphics, animations, virtual reality, web, artistic projects, or other visual media. Research papers should address cognitive and design aspects, underlying theories, taxonomies, implementation work, tool support, and case studies. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:   
 Topics for Technical Papers:   
 Visual communication metaphors 
  Cognitive aspects of visual information comprehension 
  Empirical studies of novel visual metaphors 
  Visualization on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other fields 
  Explainable artificial intelligence 
  Aesthetics in visual communication and computational aesthetics 
  Influence of visual arts and design to visual communication 
  Information visualization and visual analytics 
  Visual approaches to knowledge discovery 
  Visual interaction through multimodality 
  Visualization on mobile devices 
  Graph drawing and network visualization 
  Visual modeling languages 
  Visual programming languages 
  Graphical user interface design 
  Human-computer interaction 
  Applications in SoftVis, BioVis, GeoVis, etc. 
  Topics for Art Papers & Art and Media Galleries:   
 Generative Art & Design 
  Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) 
  Metaverse applications from domains include, but are not limited to Education, Health and Medicine, Fitness, and Sport. 
  Digital-twin applications from domains include, but are not limited to IoT management, Property management, and Smart Manufacturing. 
  Creative Visualization 
  Critical Visualization 
  Tangible Visualization 
  Data Sculpturing 
  Visual Storytelling 
  Data Art & Design 
  Information Aesthetics 
  Interactive Graphics & Design 
  Real-time Simulation 
  Creative Applications of Scientific Illustration 
  All submissions will be strictly peer-reviewed by our internationally highly regarded program committee members. The peer-reviewed conference proceedings will be published by ACM in its prestigious  ACM International Conference Proceeding Series (ICPS)   . A number of selected high-impact full-text papers will also be considered for the special journal issues. All submitted papers will have the opportunity to be considered for these Special Journal Issues.   

 Tracks    

 Technical Papers:   
 A technical paper describes a new algorithm, technique, system, or theory that has not previously appeared in the literature. The description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent/qualified graduate student in visual information communication could implement or apply the work and should provide a formal/informal evaluation and discussion regarding its strengths and weaknesses.   
 The technical papers call is open-theme, and this year, we have three types in the Technical Papers: full papers, short papers and posters.   
 The page limits are strict so please ensure that you meet the requirements:   
 Full Papers: max. 8 pages INCL. references 
  Short Papers: max. 4 pages+1 extra page which contains ONLY referernces 
  Posters: max. 2 pages INCL. references 
  ACM also requires you to specify the CSS concepts in your paper. These can be found at:   http://dl.acm.org/ccs.cfm 
  Art Papers:   
 This track serves as a link between arts, design, technology, and science by offering creative views and artistic applications. We are especially interested in the submissions that demonstrate tangible and artistic ways of visual information communication and address information aesthetics. The topics range from experimental and interdisciplinary case studies and methodologies, novel and critical interfaces for VINCI topics to critical analysis of theory and reference works in the field.   
 The art papers call is open-theme, and this year, we have three types in the Art Papers: full papers, short papers and posters.   
 The page limits are strict so please ensure that you meet the requirements:   
 Full Papers: max. 8 pages INCL. references 
  Short Papers: max. 4 pages+1 extra page which contains ONLY  references 
  Posters: max. 2 pages INCL. references 
  ACM also requires you to specify the CSS concepts in your paper. These can be found at:  http://dl.acm.org/ccs.cfm 
  Art and Media Galleries:   
 The VINCI Art and Media Galleries celebrates artistic creations demonstrating conceptual and technological innovation related to visual information communication and interaction. We accept project topics, including data art, generative art and design, interactive graphics, real-time simulation, scientific illustration, creative and critical visualization, and more. The art and media g  aller  ies call is open-theme, and this year, we have two types in the Art and Media Galleries:  Media Demos  and  Artworks  .   
 Media Demos: It seeks submissions from media creators, producers, researchers, developers, startups, universities, institutes, companies, and others who can demonstrate novel experiences, productions, and applications (e.g., Metaverse or Digital Twin). 
  Artworks: It welcomes all forms and formats, exploring new artistic expression, creativity, and creation possibilities in any 2-dimensional form suitable for display on a digital screen or canvas. We also encourage submissions of innovative AIGC artworks. 
  Submissions for both types should include up to  2 pages  of poster/description/artist’s statement. Works should have been completed within the last 5 years (in or after 2019) and be ready for installation. While we don't restrict previously exhibited work, accompanying materials should not have been published or accepted for publication elsewhere.   
 Selected works will be exhibited at the National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University. We will collaborate with selected artists to discuss exhibition logistics and final display arrangements. Unless specified otherwise, artists are responsible for covering shipping costs for physical objects.
