   Large-scale Internet Measurements (2012-2019)  
 Large-scale measurement platforms such as RIPE Atlas or Sam Knows have been developed in order to measure the performance of the Internet from a wide variety of endpoints. A key goal is to estimate the service quality delivered to customers and to identify problems impacting the service quality. In the context of large scale Internet measurements, we have been working on the following topics:  
 Standardization of measurement control protocols (LMAP) 
  Measurement of the impact of the transition to IPv6 
  Measurement of access network (last-mile) characteristics

   Flow-based Network Traffic Analysis (2007-2017)  
 We are interested in understanding how real-world networks behave. Since packet inspection does not scale, we are primarily looking into the analysis of aggregated traffic flows. We are working both on base technology for processing large amounts of flow records and its application for identifying applications and users based on their specific flow signatures. Our work has covered the following topics:  
 Cybermetrics – user identification based on flow records 
  Detection of application signatures in flow records 
  Stream-based flow query processing 
  Trace animation and visualization

   Protocols for the Internet of Things (2008-2016)  
 The Internet is streching out into everyday objects. There is a large potential in networking everyday things and some people even believe that smart objects are helping to solve our energy consumption problems (by enabling smart power grids). In the context of the Internet of Things, we have been working on the following topics:  
 6LoWPAN implementation and interoperability testing 
  SNMP on constrained devices 
  NETCONF on constrained devices 
  Evaluation of attacks on the RPL routing protocol 
  Development of MIB modules for 6LoWPAN and RPL

   Network Protocol Security (2006-2011)  
 The Internet developed from a research network into a basic utility of today’s society and the global economy. While in the early days security did not play a major role in the design of protocols, the state of things has changed completely. While the use of cryptographic algorithms to protect protocols is meanwhile reasonably well understood, the biggest problem remains the interface to humans (in particular key management schemes) but also the performance impact of security protocols must be understood. In this context, we have been working on the following topics:  
 Design of a session resumption mechanism for SSH 
  Extensions of the SNMP architecture to leverage secure transports 
  Performance analysis of SNMP over SSH/TLS/DTLS 
  Prefix- and lexicographic-order-preserving IP address anonymization

   Underwater Networks (2009-2011)  
 Underwater networking technologies are recently getting more research attention since the exploration and monitoring of the oceans has become increasingly important. In the aquatic environment, acoustic communication is frequently used to cover longer distances since higher frequencies are easily absorbed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the acoustic channel change significantly depending on the depth, salinity, or temperature of the water, and there are often strong fluctuations of the channel characteristics. We have been working on the following topics:  
 Channel, propagation and ambient noise models 
  NS-2 based underwater networking simulation 
  USARSim based underwater robotics communication simulation 
  Environmentally adaptive networking (routing, modulation) 
  For further information, see the following publications:

   Disruption Tolerant Networks (2008-2011)  
 Disruption tolerant networks are designed to provide communication in unstable and stressed environments, where the network is subject to frequent and long lasting disruptions. In this context, we have looked at techniques that can save energy and at the same time offer a high probability to enable communication.

   Distributed Case-based Reasoning (2007-2011)  
 The resolution of faults in communication networks and distributed systems is to a large extend a human driven process. The fault resolution process is usually assisted by trouble ticket systems to organize the work-flows. Today, the Internet contains a large amount of information that can be used to find similar cases in order to resolve a fault. However, general purpose search engines do not work too well. Our contribution is the design of a distributed case-based reasoning system to assist operators in resolving faults:  
 Peer-to-peer architecture using feedback search 
  Semi-structured multi-vector data representation method 
  Crawlers for extracting data from bug tracking systems 
  Probabilisitic and collaborative reasoning engines
