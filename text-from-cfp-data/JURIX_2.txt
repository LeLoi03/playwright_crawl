 Working Paper series  

 The working paper series aims to further excellence in scholarship. It allows Maastricht-based authors to bring their work-in-progress to a wide audience, facilitating fruitful discussion and critical input on nascent ideas and projects to the benefit of both author and reader.  
   
 The series builds upon the tradition of excellence of the Ius Commune  Research School, the Maastricht Centre for Human Rights  , and the Transnational Legal Research Centre, METRO  .   
   
  We welcome submissions from our partners in these endeavours.​
