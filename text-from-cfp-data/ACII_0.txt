 Call for Papers  
   
 The Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) invites you to submit your research for presentation at our 12th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), which will be held in Glasgow, UK, September 16-18, 2024.  
 The Conference series on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore (conditional on the approval by IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2024 will be invited to submit extended versions to the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing  .  
 The theme for ACII 2024 is Human and Beyond  (e.g., animals, virtual agents, and robots). The goal is to move from interaction settings involving only humans, the most common topic in Affective Computing, to more general scenarios in which multiple types of agents (natural and artificial) share a common social landscape and seamlessly participate in efficient and effective interactions.  
 The conference will be co-located with IVA ( Intelligent Virtual Agent Conference  ), 2024.
