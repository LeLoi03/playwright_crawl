 The 16th Annual International Conference on  
  Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS 2020)  
  Marina Del Rey, Los Angeles, California, USA  
  May 25 - 27, 2020  

  DCOSS 2020 is the 16th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems to be hosted in Los Angeles, California, USA, in June 25-27, 2020. In the last few years, we have witnessed a significant growth in the use of IoT and distributed sensor systems in a number of application areas, ranging from smart transport, energy and buildings, to factory automation, smart healthcare and environmental monitoring. In order for smart sensor systems to truly become useful and pervasive, we need to address a number of research challenges, including the tight integration of sensing and machine intelligence reliable and efficient networking, interoperability and scalability, the need for dependable autonomy interaction with humans, and important aspects of security, privacy and trust. DCOSS focuses on issues arising in the entire IoT and networked sensor systems stack: covering aspects of high-level abstractions models and languages, novel algorithms and applications, system design approaches and architectures, as well as tools for simulated and real deployments. Potential authors are invited to submit original unpublished manuscripts that demonstrate recent advances in both theoretical and experimental research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  
  Edge and fog computing: distributed computing models from sensor to cloud 
  Energy harvesting models and optimization 
  Machine intelligence in distributed sensor systems and real time analytics 
  Communication and networking primitives and protocols 
  Autonomy: closing the loop between sensing and actuation 
  Task allocation, reprogramming, and reconfiguration 
  Robustness, resilience and dependability 
  Security and privacy issues 
  Approaches, tools, and experience of deployment and operation 
  Performance analysis: complexity, correctness, scalability 
  Mobile and human-centered sensing 
  Interoperability, heterogeneity and scalability 
  Crowd sensing and social sensing techniques, applications, and systems 
  Complex systems comprising wearable, robotic and/or fixed sensor systems 
  Novel and compelling applications 
  IoT systems for emerging and developing economies 
  Green and environmentally-friendly IoT 
   
  Authors are invited to submit original unpublished manuscripts that demonstrate current research on distributed sensor systems related to DCOSS topics of interest. Please use the US letter size (8.5 X 11 in) standard IEEE conference LaTeX format or Microsoft Word template available on the link below:

  All submissions should be written in English and submitted as a full or work-in-progress paper. Full papers should have a maximum of eight (8) printed pages including figures and references. Full papers are expected to describe fully developed ideas with a thorough evaluation. Work-in-progress papers should have a maximum of four (4) printed pages including figures and references. Work-in-progress papers are expected to describe new and interesting ideas that have not yet reached full maturity.  
   
  Note that DCOSS does not follow the double-blind review policy. The names and affiliations of all the authors must be present in the submitted manuscript.
