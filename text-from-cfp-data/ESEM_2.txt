  Accepted Papers 
  Call for Papers   
 The International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement  (ESEM) Emerging Results, Vision and Reflection papers track features submissions that describe current work in progress from research or practice. Papers should clearly state the longer-term objectives and outline a plan for working towards those objectives.  
 Emerging Results  communicate initial research results of new ideas to obtain feedback from the empirical software engineering community. Vision papers  must describe long-term challenges and opportunities in empirical software engineering research and practice that are outside of current mainstream topics. Reflection  papers discuss the current impact and implications of studies published in a partnered journal (TSE, IST, EMSE, JSS, TOSEM) from between 3 and 10 years ago (i.e., 2014-2021).  

 General Scope of Submissions   
 Submissions should not  be under consideration for publication or presentation elsewhere. In addition to the specific scope of this track, submissions may address any aspect of software engineering but must tackle the problem from an empirical perspective and using a rigorous empirical method, including:  
 Empirical studies using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods 
  Cross- and multi-disciplinary methods and studies 
  Formal experiments and quasi-experiments 
  Case studies, action research, ethnography and field studies 
  Survey research 
  Simulation studies 
  Artifact studies 
  Data mining using statistical and machine learning approaches 
  Secondary and tertiary studies including | Systematic literature reviews and rapid reviews, that include a strong synthesis part 
  Meta-analyses, and qualitative, quantitative or structured syntheses of studies 
  Replication of empirical studies and families of studies 
  Topics commonly addressed using an empirical approach include, but are not limited to:  
 Evaluation and comparison of software models, tools, techniques, and practices 
  Modeling, measuring, and assessing product or process quality and productivity 
  Continuous software engineering 
  Software verification and validation, including analysis and testing 
  Engineering of software systems which include machine learning components and data dependencies 
  Applications of software engineering to different types of systems and domains (e.g. IoT, Industry 4.0, Context-awareness systems, Cyber-physical systems) 
  Human factors, teamwork, and behavioral aspects of software engineering 
  We welcome submissions on these research meta-topics:  
 Development, evaluation, and comparison of empirical approaches and methods 
  Infrastructure for conducting empirical studies 
  Techniques and tools for supporting empirical studies 
  Empirically-based decision making 
  We also welcome submissions that:  
 demonstrate multi-disciplinary work, 
  transfer and apply empirical methods from other disciplines, 
  replication studies, and 
  studies with negative findings.

 Abstract:  May 30, 2024  
  Submission:  June 7, 2024  
  Notification:  July 17, 2024  July 22, 2024  
  Camera-ready:  September 6, 2024  

 How to Submit   
 Submissions to this track are limited to 6 pages plus one page with references and must be submitted through EasyChair by selecting the track “Emerging Results, Vision and Reflection Papers”. All submissions must be written in English and must be submitted via EasyChair  in PDF format.  
 Please note:   
 Make sure the paper follows the standard ACM Proceedings template (see https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  ). 
  Make sure your paper follows the double-blind instructions and does not reveal the authors’ identities. 
  The submission must also comply with the IEEE ethics guidelines IEEE ethics guidelines  . In particular, it must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review elsewhere while under review for ESEM. 
  The ESEM 2024 Emerging Results, Vision and Reflection Papers track will employ a double-blind review process. Thus, submissions may not reveal their authors’ identities. The authors must make an acceptable effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person. More details on author ethics and peer review can be found at https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/  .  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three experts from the international program committee of the track and will receive an additional meta-review. Any papers that are outside the scope of the symposium, exceed the maximum number of pages for the respective category, or do not follow the formatting guidelines will be desk rejected without review. The PC members’ bidding information may be used to assess what is considered out of scope.  
 Finally, please note that each accepted contribution must have a minimum of one author registered by the deadline for the camera-ready submission for their respective paper type. Also, each paper must be presented by one of the authors. Failure to meet these criteria will result in the paper’s removal from the proceedings.  

 Open Science Policy   
 Openness in science is key to fostering progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. While all submissions will undergo the same review process independent of whether or not they disclose their tools, data, and code, we expect authors to include a data availability statement in their submissions that either provides links to the open data/replication package or that explains why data cannot be disclosed  (e.g., due to the sensitivity of the data or due to existing non-disclosure agreements). We recommend adding the data availability statement in the submission at the end of the introduction section explaining whether and where the data and related material is available and under which conditions the data/material can be accessed. For submissions based on open data sources, the publication of any cleaned or filtered data is mandatory.   
 To submit your tools, data, and code while still following the double-blind process, please refer to these guidelines  .  
 Authors are requested to share their tools, data, and code in the form of a replication package, and provide explanations on how to use and navigate it.  
 Qualitative studies should provide explanations about the study protocol, coding and transcription schemas, and further relevant information. 
  Quantitative studies should include information about the source code and its main dependencies (incl. version), description of input/output relevant to every step of data cleaning and labeling, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. 
  We recommend providing these explanations in the method section of the paper, while further explanations and concrete instructions on how to navigate and use the replication package can be detailed in a README file.  
 We recommend to:  
 Share pre-prints in a non-commercial repository (e.g., arXiv) using an appropriate license (e.g., arXiv default non-exclusive license, Creative Commons CC-BY). When sharing pre-prints, authors must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to ESEM 2024. We recommend against anonymizing them (i.e., by changing authors, title, abstract). The review committee members are instructed NOT to try to find out the identity of authors. 
  Share replication packages in an archival repository (e.g., Zenodo) using an appropriate license (e.g., based on Creative Commons). 
  For further information, please refer to “Open Science in Software Engineering”  book chapter and feel free to approach the Open Science chairs (Davide Fucci < davide.fucci@bth.se  > and Martin Solari < martin.solari@ort.edu.uy  >)
