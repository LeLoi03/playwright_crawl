  Call for Participation  
 The 1998 Joint International Conference and Symposium on Logic Programming JICSLP'98 will be held on 15-19 June 1998 (technical programme from 16 to 19 June) at the University of Manchester  , UK.  
 The conference is the fourth joint event for the International Conference on Logic Programming and the International Logic Programming Symposium, and is the fifteenth conference in each of the two series of premier international conferences on Logic Programming, both sponsored by the the Association for Logic Programming  .  
  
 JICSLP'98 will be co-located with LOPSTR'98  , the Eighth International Workshop on Logic-based Program Synthesis and Transformation (technical programme from 15 to 19 June) and A Compulog Net Industrial Conference on Advanced Software Applications using Logic and Constraints   
 It will also coincide with the celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the World's First Stored-Progam Computer  , the Baby, built at Manchester in 1948.  
 JICSLP'98 Outline Provisional Programme | The technical programme for JICSLP'98 will contain: | 1 keynote talk and 2 invited talks 
  4 tutorials 
  21 papers 
  a poster session 
  8 post-conference workshops 
  JICSLP'98 Keynote Speaker | Robin Milner  , Cambridge University UK 
  JICSLP'98 Invited Speakers | Nada Lavrac | , Jozef Stefan Institute, Slovenia 
  Ken McAloon | , City University of New York, USA 
  JICSLP'98 Tutorials | SICStus Prolog and Agent-based Systems (Olle Olsson) 
  Logic Program Transformation (Alberto Pettorossi and Maurizio Proietti) 
  Inheritance with Exceptions and LP (Jia-Huai You and Li Yan Yuan) 
  Model Checking and XSB (C.R. Ramakrishnan) 
  JICSLP'98 Post-Conference Workshops | Logic Programming and Soft Computing (LPSC'98) 
  Transactions and Change in Logic Databases (DYNAMICS'98) 
  Automated Software Engineering and Logic Programming 
  CompulogNet Area Meeting on Computational Logic and Machine Learning 
  Deductive Databases and Logic Programming (DDLP'98) 
  Implementation Technologies for Programming Languages based on Logic 
  Types for Constraint Logic Programming 
   As a workshop, LOPSTR'98 will continue the tradition of being a lively and friendly forum for presenting recent and current research as well as discussing future trends in the synthesis and transformation of programs.  
 The scope encompasses any computational-logic-based techniques, languages, and tools for the interactive or automated development of any kinds of programs, programming-in-the-large issues, practical applications, or practical applicability of theoretical results.  
 LOPSTR'98 Outline Provisional Programme 
  The technical programme for LOPSTR'98 will contain: 1 | invited talk | by | Pierre Wolper | , Université de Liège, Belgium. 
  27 working papers 
  1 session of system demos 
  LOPSTR'98 participants can also attend any parts of the JICSLP'98 technical programme. The post-JICSLP'98 workshop on on Automated Software Engineering and Logic Programming should be of particular interest to LOPSTR'98 delegates.
