 Research Interests  
 What are the challenges in creating interfaces that allow a user to intuitively act and express his/her intentions? Today's Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems include virtual / augmented reality are limited, and exploit only visual and auditory sensations. However, in daily life, we exploit a variety of input and output modalities, and modalities that involve contact with our bodies can dramatically affect our ability to experience and express ourselves in physical and virtual worlds. Using modern physiological understandings of sensation and perception, emerging electronic devices, and agile computational methods, we now have an opportunity to design a new generation of "Human-Computer Integrated" systems.  
 We have archived several improvements that use multi/cross modal interfaces for enhancing human I/O. They include Transparent Cockpit, Stop-Motion Goggle, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation, JINS MEME (electrooculography (EOG)-based smart glasses) and Superhuman Sports.  
 Our challenges include:  
  (1) Understanding human factors  
  (2) Enhancing human I/O  
  (3) Designing new body schema  
  (4) Experience engineering and entertainment computing
