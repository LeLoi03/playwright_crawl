 ID: 8 | Exploration for Free: How Does Reward Heterogeneity Improve Regret in Cooperative Multi-agent Bandits?   
  
 Xuchuang Wang, Lin Yang, Yu-Zhen Janice Chen, Xutong Liu, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Don Towsley, John C.S. Lui  

  TL;DR:  We study the free exploration mechanism in the multi-agent multi-armed bandits with heterogeneous reward model.   Abstract:   
 This paper studies a cooperative multi-agent bandit scenario in which the rewards observed by agents are heterogeneous---one agent's meat can be another agent's poison. Specifically, the total reward observed by each agent is the sum of two values: an arm-specific reward, capturing the intrinsic value of the arm, and a privately-known agent-specific reward, which captures the personal preference/limitations of the agent. This heterogeneity in total reward leads to different local optimal arms for agents but creates an opportunity for *free exploration* in a cooperative setting---an agent can freely explore its local optimal arm with no regret and share this free observation with some other agents who would suffer regrets if they pull this arm since the arm is not optimal for them. We first characterize a regret lower bound that captures free exploration, i.e., arms that can be freely explored have no contribution to the regret lower bound. Then, we present a cooperative bandit algorithm that takes advantage of free exploration and achieves a near-optimal regret upper bound which tightly matches the regret lower bound up to a constant factor. Lastly, we run numerical simulations to compare our algorithm with various baselines without free exploration. 
 ID: 11 | ViBid: Linear Vision Transformer with Bidirectional Normalization   
  
 Jeonggeun Song, Heung-Chang Lee  

  TL;DR:  We empirically demonstrated the shortcomings of softmax-free and the significance of softmax in attention through BiNorm experiments. Binorm is the simplest adaptation of the current matrix multiplication order-changing algorithms.   Abstract:   
 The vision transformer has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks; however, the memory consumption is larger than those of previous convolutional neural network based models because of O(N^2) time and memory complexity of the general self-attention models. Many approaches aim to change the complexity to O(N) to solve this problem; however, they stack deep convolutional layers to retain locality or complicate the architecture as seen in window attention, to compensate for the performance degradation. To solve these problems, we propose ViBid algorithm, which resolves the complexity problem of O(N^2) by replacing Softmax with bidirectional normalization (BiNorm). In addition, it has a much simpler architecture than the existing transformer model with O(N) complexity. Owing to our simple architecture, we were able to use larger resolutions for training, and we obtained a lighter and superior GPU throughput model with competitive performance. ViBid can be used with any transformer method that uses queries, keys, and values (QKV) because of BiNorm, and it is quite universal due to its simple architectural structure. 
 ID: 24 | Pessimistic Model Selection for Deep Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Chao-Han Huck Yang, Zhengling Qi, Yifan Cui, Pin-Yu Chen  

  TL;DR:  A pessimistic model selection approach for offline deep reinforcement with a theoretical guarantee is presented.   Abstract:   
 Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated great potentials in solving sequential decision making problems in many applications. Despite its promising performance, practical gaps exist when deploying DRL in real-world scenarios. One main barrier is the over-fitting issue that leads to poor generalizability of the policy learned by DRL. In particular, for offline DRL with observational data, model selection is a challenging task as there is no ground truth available for performance demonstration, in contrast with the online setting with simulated environments. In this work, we propose a pessimistic model selection (PMS) approach for offline DRL with a theoretical guarantee, which features a tuning-free framework for finding the best policy among a set of candidate models. Two refined approaches are also proposed to address the potential bias of DRL model in identifying the optimal policy. Numerical studies demonstrated the superior performance of our approach over existing methods. 
 ID: 31 | RDM-DC: Poisoning Resilient Dataset Condensation with Robust Distribution Matching   
  
 Tianhang Zheng, Baochun Li  

    Abstract:   
 Dataset condensation aims to condense the original training dataset into a small synthetic dataset for data-efficient learning. The recently proposed dataset condensation techniques allow the model trainers with limited resources to learn acceptable deep learning models on a small amount of synthetic data. However, in an adversarial environment, given the original dataset as a poisoned dataset, dataset condensation may encode the poisoning information into the condensed synthetic dataset. To explore the vulnerability of dataset condensation to data poisoning, we revisit the state-of-the-art targeted data poisoning method and customize a targeted data poisoning algorithm for dataset condensation. By executing the two poisoning methods, we demonstrate that, when the synthetic dataset is condensed from a poisoned dataset, the models trained on the synthetic dataset may predict the targeted sample as the attack-targeted label. To defend against data poisoning, we introduce the concept of poisoned deviation to quantify the poisoning effect. We further propose a poisoning-resilient dataset condensation algorithm with a calibration method to reduce poisoned deviation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can protect the synthetic dataset from data poisoning with minor performance drop. 
 ID: 34 | Online Estimation of Similarity Matrices with Incomplete Data

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  The paper proposes a series of matrix correction algorithms that estimate similarity matrices with incomplete data streams in different online scenarios.   Abstract:   
 The similarity matrix measures the pairwise similarities between a set of data points. It is an essential concept in data processing and is routinely used in practical applications. Obtaining the similarity matrix is usually trivial when the data points are completely observed. However, getting a high-quality similarity matrix often turns hard when there are incomplete observations, which becomes even more complex on sequential data streams. To address the challenge, we propose matrix correction algorithms that leverage the positive semi-definiteness of the similarity matrix to provide improved similarity estimation in both offline and online scenarios. Our approaches have a solid theoretical guarantee of performance and excellent potential for parallel execution on large-scale data. They also exhibit high effectiveness and efficiency in empirical evaluations with significantly improved results over the classical imputation-based methods, benefiting downstream applications with superior performance. 
 ID: 35 | Consistent Emphatic Temporal-Difference Learning   
  
 Jiamin He, Fengdi Che, Yi Wan, A. Rupam Mahmood  
   
    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We proposed the first practical consistent off-policy TD algorithm and showed its competitive performance.   Abstract:   
 Off-policy policy evaluation has been a critical and challenging problem in reinforcement learning, and Temporal-Difference (TD) learning is one of the most important approaches for addressing it. Notably, Full Importance-Sampling TD is the only existing off-policy TD method that is guaranteed to find the on-policy TD fixed point in the linear function approximation setting but, unfortunately, has a high variance and is scarcely practical. This notorious high variance issue motivates the introduction of Emphatic TD, which tames down the variance but has a biased fixed point. Inspired by these two methods, we propose a new consistent algorithm with a transient bias, which strikes a balance between bias and variance. Further, we unify the new algorithm with several existing algorithms and obtain a new family of consistent algorithms called \emph{Consistent Emphatic TD} (CETD($\lambda$, $\beta$, $\nu$)), which can control a smooth bias-variance trade-off by varying the speed at which the transient bias fades. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on a didactic example, we validate the consistency of CETD($\lambda$, $\beta$, $\nu$). Moreover, we show that CETD($\lambda$, $\beta$, $\nu$) converges faster to the lowest error in a complex task with a high variance. 
 ID: 39 | Learning Choice Functions with Gaussian Processes   
  
 Alessio Benavoli, Dario Azzimonti, Dario Piga  
   
    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We develop a Gaussian Process based-method to learn choice functions from choice data via Pareto rationalisation.   Abstract:   
 In consumer theory, ranking available objects by means of preference relations yields the most common description of individual choices. However, preference-based models assume that individuals: (1) give their preferences only between pairs of objects; (2) are always able to pick the best preferred object. In many situations, they may be instead choosing out of a set with more than two elements and, because of lack of information and/or incomparability (objects with contradictory characteristics), they may not able to select a single most preferred object. To address these situations, we need a choice-model which allows an individual to express a set-valued choice. Choice functions provide such a mathematical framework. We propose a Gaussian Process model to learn choice functions from choice-data. The proposed model assumes a multiple utility representation of a choice function based on the concept of Pareto rationalisation, and derives a strategy to learn both the number and the values of these latent multiple utilities. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 
 ID: 40 | Exploiting Inferential Structure in Neural Processes   
  
 Dharmesh Tailor, Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan, Eric Nalisnick  

    Abstract:   
 Neural Processes (NPs) are appealing due to their ability to perform fast adaptation based on a context set. This set is encoded by a latent variable, which is often assumed to follow a simple distribution. However, in real-word settings, the context set may be drawn from richer distributions having multiple modes, heavy tails, etc. In this work, we provide a framework that allows NPs’ latent variable to be given a rich prior defined by a graphical model. These distributional assumptions directly translate into an appropriate aggregation strategy for the context set. Moreover, we describe a message-passing procedure that still allows for end-to-end optimization with stochastic gradients. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by using mixture and Student-t assumptions that yield improvements in function modelling and test-time robustness. 
 ID: 41 | Inference and Sampling of Point Processes from Diffusion Excursions   
 [spotlight]  
 Ali Hasan, Yu Chen, Yuting Ng, Mohamed Abdelghani, Anderson Schneider, Vahid Tarokh  

  TL;DR:  We develop methods to represent point processes in terms of excursions of a diffusion.   Abstract:   
 Point processes often have a natural interpretation with respect to a continuous process. We propose a point process construction that describes arrival time observations in terms of the state of a latent diffusion process. In this framework, we relate the return time of diffusion in a continuous path space to new arrivals of the point process. These models arise in many disciplines, such as financial settings where actions in a market are determined by a hidden continuous price or in neuroscience where a latent stimulus generates spike trains. Based on the developments in It\^o's excursion theory, we describe computational methods for inferring and sampling from the point process derived from the diffusion process. We provide numerical examples for the proposed method using both simulated and real data to illustrate the approach. The proposed methods and framework provide a basis for interpreting point processes through the lens of a diffusion. 
 ID: 42 | Learning Robust Representation for Reinforcement Learning with Distractions by Reward Sequence Prediction   
  
 Qi Zhou, Jie Wang, Qiyuan Liu, Yufei Kuang, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li  

  TL;DR:  Our method learns robust representations by predicting reward sequences via a novel TD-style algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency and generalization in environments with distractions.   Abstract:   
 Reinforcement learning algorithms have achieved impressive success in learning behaviors from pixels. However, their application to real-world tasks remains challenging because of their sensitivity to visual distractions (e.g., changes in viewpoint and light). A major reason is that the learned representations often suffer from overfitting task-irrelevant information. By comparing several representation learning methods, we find that the key to robust representation learning is the choice of prediction targets. Therefore, we propose a novel representation learning approach---namely, Reward Sequence Prediction (RSP)---that uses reward sequences or their transforms (e.g., discrete time Fourier transform) as prediction targets. RSP can learn robust representations efficiently because reward sequences rarely contain task-irrelevant information while providing sufficient supervised signals to accelerate representation learning. An appealing feature is that RSP makes no assumption about the type of distractions and thus can improve performance even when multiple types of distractions exist. We evaluate our approach in Distracting Control Suite. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency and generalization ability in tasks with distractions. 
 ID: 45 | Information Theoretic Clustering via Divergence Maximization among Cluster Distributions   
  
 Sahil Garg, Mina Dalirrooyfard, Anderson Schneider, Yeshaya Adler, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Yu Chen, Fengpei Li, Guillermo Cecchi  

    Abstract:   
 Information-theoretic clustering is one of the most promising and principled approaches to finding clusters with minimal apriori assumptions. The key criterion therein is to maximize the mutual information between the data points and their cluster labels. We instead propose to maximize the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence between the underlying distributions associated to clusters (referred to as cluster distributions). We show it to be equivalent to optimizing over the mutual information criterion while simultaneously maximizing cross entropy between the cluster distributions. For practical efficiency, we propose to empirically estimate the objective of KL-D between clusters in its dual form leveraging deep neural nets as a dual function approximator. Remarkably, our theoretical analysis establishes that estimating the divergence measure in its dual form simplifies the problem of clustering to one of optimally finding k ‚àí 1 cut points for k clusters in the 1-D dual functional space. Overall, our approach enables linear-time clustering algorithms with theoretical guarantees of near-optimality, owing to the submodularity of the objective. We show the empirical superiority of our approach w.r.t. current state-of-the-art methods on the challenging task of clustering noisy timeseries as observed in domains such as neuroscience, healthcare, financial markets, spatio-temporal environmental dynamics, etc. 
 ID: 46 | In- or Out-of-Distribution Detection via Dual Divergence Estimation   
  
 Sahil Garg, Sanghamitra Dutta, Mina Dalirrooyfard, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka  

    Abstract:   
 Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is a problem of practical importance for a reliable use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in production settings. The corollary to this problem is the detection in-distribution (ID) samples, which is applicable to domain adaptation scenarios for augmenting a train set with ID samples from other data sets, or to continual learning for replay from the past. For both ID or OOD detection, we propose a principled yet simple approach of (empirically) estimating KL-Divergence, in its dual form, for a given test set w.r.t. a known set of ID samples in order to quantify the contribution of each test sample individually towards the divergence measure and accordingly detect it as OOD or ID. Our approach is compute-efficient and enjoys strong theoretical guarantees. For WideResnet101 and ViT-L-16, by considering ImageNet-1k dataset as the ID benchmark, we evaluate the proposed OOD detector on 51 test (OOD) datasets, and observe drastically and consistently lower false positive rates w.r.t. all the competitive methods. Moreover, the proposed ID detector is evaluated, using ECG and stock price datasets, for the task of data augmentation in domain adaptation and continual learning settings, and we observe higher efficacy compared to relevant baselines. 
 ID: 47 | On Identifiability of Conditional Causal Effects   
  
 Yaroslav Kivva, Jalal Etesami, Negar Kiyavash  

    Abstract:   
 We address the problem of identifiability of an arbitrary conditional causal effect given both the causal graph and a set of any observational and/or interventional distributions of the form $Q[S]:=P(S|do(V\setminus S))$, where $V$ denotes the set of all observed variables and $S\subseteq V$. We call this problem conditional generalized identifiability (c-gID in short) and prove the completeness of Pearl's $do$-calculus for the c-gID problem by providing sound and complete algorithm for the c-gID problem. This work revisited the c-gID problem in Lee et al. [2020], Correa et al. [2021] by adding explicitly the positivity assumption which is crucial for identifiability. It extends the results of [Lee et al., 2019, Kivva et al., 2022] on general identifiability (gID) which studied the problem for unconditional causal effects and Shpitser and Pearl [2006b] on identifiability of conditional causal effects given merely the observational distribution $P(\mathbf{V})$ as our algorithm generalizes the algorithms proposed in [Kivva et al., 2022] and [Shpitser and Pearl, 2006b]. 
 ID: 56 | Stochastic Generative Flow Networks   
 [spotlight]  
 Ling Pan, Dinghuai Zhang, Moksh Jain, Longbo Huang, Yoshua Bengio  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel Stochastic GFlowNet method for extending GFlowNets to the more general stochastic environments.   Abstract:   
 Generative Flow Networks (or GFlowNets for short) are a family of probabilistic agents that learn to sample complex combinatorial structures through the lens of ``inference as control''. They have shown great potential in generating high-quality and diverse candidates from a given energy landscape. However, existing GFlowNets can be applied only to deterministic environments, and fail in more general tasks with stochastic dynamics, which can limit their applicability. To overcome this challenge, this paper introduces Stochastic GFlowNets, a new algorithm that extends GFlowNets to stochastic environments. By decomposing state transitions into two steps, Stochastic GFlowNets isolate environmental stochasticity and learn a dynamics model to capture it. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Stochastic GFlowNets offer significant advantages over standard GFlowNets as well as MCMC- and RL-based approaches, on a variety of standard benchmarks with stochastic dynamics. 
 ID: 67 | Personalized Federated Domain Adaptation for Item-to-Item Recommendation   
  
 Ziwei Fan, Trong Nghia Hoang, HAO DING, Anoop Deoras  

  TL;DR:  We propose and investigate a personalized federated modeling framework based on GNNs to summarize, assemble and adapt recommendation patterns across markets with heterogeneous customer behaviors into effective local models   Abstract:   
 Item-to-Item (I2I) recommendation is an important function in most recommendation systems, which generates replacement or complement suggestions for a particular item based on its semantic similarities to other cataloged items. Given that subsets of items in a recommendation system might be co-interacted with by the same set of customers, graph-based models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), provide a natural framework to combine, ingest and extract valuable insights from such high-order relational interactions between cataloged items, as well as their metadata features, as has been shown in many recent studies. However, learning GNNs effectively for I2I requires ingesting a large amount of relational data, which might not always be available, especially in new, emerging market segments. To mitigate this data bottleneck, we postulate that recommendation patterns learned from existing mature market segments (with private data) could be adapted to build effective warm-start models for emerging ones. To achieve this, we propose and investigate a personalized federated modeling framework based on GNNs to summarize, assemble and adapt recommendation patterns across market segments with heterogeneous customer behaviors into effective local models. Our key contribution is a personalized graph adaptation model that bridges the gap between recent literature on federated GNNs and (non-graph) personalized federated learning, which either does not optimize for the adaptability of the federated model or is restricted to local models with homogeneous parameterization, excluding GNNs with heterogeneous local graphs. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated on a real-world dataset on multiple item categories spanning multiple market segments. 
 ID: 79 | BISCUIT: Causal Representation Learning from Binary Interactions   
 [spotlight]

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  BISCUIT identifies causal variables from high-dimensional observations using binary interactions between an external system (e.g. robot) and the causal variables.   Abstract:   
 Identifying the causal variables of an environment and how to intervene on them is of core value in applications such as robotics and embodied AI. While an agent can commonly interact with the environment and may implicitly perturb the behavior of some of these causal variables, often the targets it affects remain unknown. In this paper, we show that causal variables can still be identified for many common setups, e.g., additive Gaussian noise models, if the agent's interactions with a causal variable can be described by an unknown binary variable. This happens when each causal variable has two different mechanisms, e.g., an observational and an interventional one. Using this identifiability result, we propose BISCUIT, a method for simultaneously learning causal variables and their corresponding binary interaction variables. On three robotic-inspired datasets, BISCUIT accurately identifies causal variables and can even be scaled to complex, realistic environments for embodied AI. 
 ID: 80 | Memory Mechanism for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection   
  
 Jiahao Li, Yiqiang Chen, Yunbing Xing  

  TL;DR:  This paper proposed a memory mechanism to enable the model learning to know unknowns.   Abstract:   
 Unsupervised anomaly detection is a binary classification that detects anomalies in unseen samples given only unlabeled normal data. Reconstruction-based approaches are widely used, which perform reconstruction error minimization on training data to learn normal patterns and quantify the degree of anomalies by reconstruction errors on testing data. However, this approach tends to miss anomalies when the normal data has multi-pattern. Because the model generalizes unrestrictedly beyond normal patterns even to include anomaly patterns. In this paper, we proposed a memory mechanism that memorizes typical normal patterns through a capacity-controlled external differentiable matrix so that the generalization of the model to anomalies is limited by the retrieval of the matrix. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks. 
 ID: 82 | Split, Count, and Share: A Differentially Private Set Intersection Cardinality Estimation Protocol   
  
 Michael Purcell, Yang Li, Kee Siong Ng  

  TL;DR:  We present a simple privacy-preserving protocol for estimating the cardinality of the intersection of two sets.   Abstract:   
 We describe a simple two-party protocol in which each party contributes a set as input. The output of the protocol is an estimate of the cardinality of the intersection of the two input sets. We show that our protocol is efficient and secure. In particular, we show that the space complexity and communication complexity are constant, the time complexity for each party is proportional to the size of their input set, and that our protocol is differentially private. We also analyze the distribution of the output of the protocol, deriving both its asymptotic distribution and finite-sample bounds on its tail probabilities. These analyses show that, when the input sets are large, our protocol produces accurate set intersection cardinality estimates. As such, we claim that our protocol is an attractive alternative to traditional private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA) protocols when the input sets are large, exact precision is not required, and differential privacy on its own can provide sufficient protection to the underlying sensitive data. 
 ID: 84 | How to Use Dropout Correctly on Residual Networks with Batch Normalization   
  
 Bum Jun Kim, Hyeyeon Choi, Hyeonah Jang, Donggeon Lee, Sang Woo Kim  

  TL;DR:  In this study, we investigate the correct position to apply Dropout.   Abstract:   
 For the stable optimization of deep neural networks, regularization methods such as dropout and batch normalization have been used in various tasks. Nevertheless, the correct position to apply dropout has rarely been discussed, and different positions have been employed depending on the practitioners. In this study, we investigate the correct position to apply dropout. We demonstrate that for a residual network with batch normalization, applying dropout at certain positions increases the performance, whereas applying dropout at other positions decreases the performance. Based on theoretical analysis, we provide the following guideline for the correct position to apply dropout: apply one dropout after the last batch normalization but before the last weight layer in the residual branch. We provide detailed theoretical explanations to support this claim and demonstrate them through module tests. In addition, we investigate the correct position of dropout in the head that produces the final prediction. Although the current consensus is to apply dropout after global average pooling, we prove that applying dropout before global average pooling leads to a more stable output. The proposed guidelines are validated through experiments using different datasets and models. 
 ID: 85 | DeepGD3: Unknown-Aware Deep Generative/Discriminative Hybrid Defect Detector for PCB Soldering Inspection   
  
 Ching-Wen Ma, Yanwei Liu  
   
    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  A generative/discriminative hybrid model effectively address the issue of performance degradation when the test samples come from new components for which no defective sample is available.   Abstract:   
 This paper presents a novel approach for detecting soldering defects in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) composed mainly of Surface Mount Technology (SMT) components, using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. The main challenge addressed is the detection of soldering defects in new components for which only examples of good soldering are available at the model training phase. To meet industrial quality standards, we must keep the leakage rate (i.e., miss detection rate) low. To address this, we design the system to be "unknown-aware" with a low unknown rate and utilize the knowledge gained from the soldering examples of old components to detect the soldering defects of new components. We evaluated the method on a real-world dataset from an electronics company. It significantly reduces the leakage rate from 1.827\% $\pm$ 3.063\% to 0.063\% $\pm$ 0.075\% with an unknown rate of 3.706\% $\pm$ 2.270\%, compared to the baseline approach. 
 ID: 88 | Low-Rank Matrix Recovery with Unknown Correspondence   
  
 Zhiwei Tang, Tsung-Hui Chang, Xiaojing Ye, Hongyuan Zha  

  TL;DR:  We formulate a new matrix recovery problem for addressing a common obstacle in utilizing heterogeneous data, and develop an efficient algorithm to solve it.   Abstract:   
 We study a matrix recovery problem with unknown correspondence: given the observation matrix $M_o=[A,\tilde P B]$, where $\tilde P$ is an unknown permutation matrix, we aim to recover the underlying matrix $M=[A,B]$. Such problem commonly arises in many applications where heterogeneous data are utilized and the correspondence among them are unknown, e.g., due to data mishandling or privacy concern. We show that, in some applications, it is possible to recover $M$ via solving a nuclear norm minimization problem. Moreover, under a proper low-rank condition on $M$, we derive a non-asymptotic error bound for the recovery of $M$. We propose an algorithm, $\text{M}^3\text{O}$ (Matrix recovery via Min-Max Optimization) which recasts this combinatorial problem as a continuous minimax optimization problem and solves it by proximal gradient with a Max-Oracle. $\text{M}^3\text{O}$ can also be applied to a more general scenario where we have missing entries in $M_o$ and multiple groups of data with distinct unknown correspondence. Experiments on simulated data, the MovieLens 100K dataset and Yale B database show that $\text{M}^3\text{O}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance over several baselines and can recover the ground-truth correspondence with high accuracy. 
 ID: 91 | Quasi-Bayesian Nonparametric Density Estimation via Autoregressive Predictive Updates   
 [spotlight]  
 Sahra Ghalebikesabi, Christopher C. Holmes, Edwin Fong, Brieuc Lehmann  

    Abstract:   
 Bayesian methods are a popular choice for statistical inference in small-data regimes due to the regularization effect induced by the prior. In the context of density estimation, the standard nonparametric Bayesian approach is to target the posterior predictive of the Dirichlet process mixture model. In general, direct estimation of the posterior predictive is intractable and so methods typically resort to approximating the posterior distribution as an intermediate step. The recent development of quasi-Bayesian predictive copula updates, however, has made it possible to perform tractable predictive density estimation without the need for posterior approximation. Although these estimators are computationally appealing, they tend to struggle on non-smooth data distributions. This is due to the comparatively restrictive form of the likelihood models from which the proposed copula updates were derived. To address this shortcoming, we consider a Bayesian nonparametric model with an autoregressive likelihood decomposition and a Gaussian process prior. While the predictive update of such a model is typically intractable, we derive a quasi-Bayesian predictive update that achieves state-of-the-art results on moderate-sized examples.

    [slides]   
   
  TL;DR:  We propose a physics-driven molecular representation learning method powered by self-supervised masked atomic modeling, and novel evaluation schemes to ensure reliability of the model in various ways.   Abstract:   
 Estimating the energetic properties of molecular systems is a critical task in material design. Machine learning has shown remarkable promise on this task over classical force-fields, but a fully data-driven approach suffers from limited labeled data; not just the amount of available data lacks, but the distribution of labeled examples is highly skewed to stable states. In this work, we propose a molecular representation learning method that extrapolates well beyond the training distribution, powered by physics-driven parameter estimation from classical energy equations and self-supervised learning inspired from masked language modeling. To ensure reliability of the proposed model, we introduce a series of novel evaluation schemes in multifaceted ways, beyond the energy or force accuracy that has been dominantly used. From extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in discovering molecular structures, outperforming other baselines. Furthermore, we extrapolate it to the chemical reaction pathways beyond stable states, taking a step towards physically reliable molecular representation learning. 
 ID: 100 | Nonconvex Stochastic Scaled-Gradient Descent and Generalized Eigenvector Problems   
  
 Chris Junchi Li, Michael Jordan  

    Abstract:   
 Motivated by the problem of online canonical correlation analysis, we propose the \emph{Stochastic Scaled-Gradient Descent} (SSGD) algorithm for minimizing the expectation of a stochastic function over a generic Riemannian manifold. SSGD generalizes the idea of projected stochastic gradient descent and allows the use of scaled stochastic gradients instead of stochastic gradients. In the special case of a spherical constraint, which arises in generalized eigenvector problems, we establish a nonasymptotic finite-sample bound of $\sqrt{1/T}$, and show that this rate is minimax optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor of relevant parameters. On the asymptotic side, a novel trajectory-averaging argument allows us to achieve local asymptotic normality with a rate that matches that of Ruppert-Polyak-Juditsky averaging. We bring these ideas together in an application to online canonical correlation analysis, deriving, for the first time in the literature, an optimal one-time-scale algorithm with an explicit rate of local asymptotic convergence to normality. Numerical studies of canonical correlation analysis are also provided for synthetic data. 
 ID: 105 | MDPose: Real-Time Multi-Person Pose Estimation via Mixture Density Model   
  
 Seunghyeon Seo, Jaeyoung Yoo, Jihye Hwang, Nojun Kwak  

  TL;DR:  We reformulate multi-person pose estimation task as a density estimation, enabling real-time instance-aware keypoint estimation without any additional instance identification process.   Abstract:   
 One of the major challenges in multi-person pose estimation is instance-aware keypoint estimation. Previous methods address this problem by leveraging an off-the-shelf detector, heuristic post-grouping process or explicit instance identification process, hindering further improvements in the inference speed which is an important factor for practical applications. From the statistical point of view, those additional processes for identifying instances are necessary to bypass learning the high-dimensional joint distribution of human keypoints, which is a critical factor for another major challenge, the occlusion scenario. In this work, we propose a novel framework of single-stage instance-aware pose estimation by modeling the joint distribution of human keypoints with a mixture density model, termed as MDPose. Our MDPose estimates the distribution of human keypoints' coordinates using a mixture density model with an instance-aware keypoint head consisting simply of 8 convolutional layers. It is trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the ground truth keypoints. Also, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy, Random Keypoint Grouping (RKG), which significantly alleviates the underflow problem leading to successful learning of relations between keypoints. On OCHuman dataset, which consists of images with highly occluded people, our MDPose achieves state-of-the-art performance by successfully learning the high-dimensional joint distribution of human keypoints. Furthermore, our MDPose shows significant improvement in inference speed with a competitive accuracy on MS COCO, a widely-used human keypoint dataset, thanks to the proposed much simpler single-stage pipeline. 
 ID: 114 | Bayesian Numerical Integration with Neural Networks

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel architecture for neural networks for numerical integration based on the Stein operator with an approximation of the Bayesian posterior based on the Laplace approximation.   Abstract:   
 Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods for numerical integration offer significant advantages over their non-Bayesian counterparts: they can encode prior information about the integrand, and can quantify uncertainty over estimates of an integral. However, the most popular algorithm in this class, Bayesian quadrature, is based on Gaussian process models and is therefore associated with a high computational cost. To improve scalability, we propose an alternative approach based on Bayesian neural networks which we call Bayesian Stein networks. The key ingredients are a neural network architecture based on Stein operators, and an approximation of the Bayesian posterior based on the Laplace approximation. We show that this leads to orders of magnitude speed-ups on the popular Genz functions benchmark, and on challenging problems arising in the Bayesian analysis of dynamical systems, and the prediction of energy production for a large-scale wind farm.

    Abstract:   
 Client selection schemes are widely adopted to handle the communication-efficient problems in recent studies of Federated Learning (FL). However, the large variance of the model updates aggregated from the randomly-selected unrepresentative subsets directly slows the FL convergence. We present a novel clustering-based client selection scheme to accelerate the FL convergence by variance reduction. Simple yet effective schemes are designed to improve the clustering effect and control the effect fluctuation, therefore, generating the client subset with certain representativeness of sampling. Theoretically, we demonstrate the improvement of the proposed scheme in variance reduction. We also present the tighter convergence guarantee of the proposed method thanks to the variance reduction. Experimental results confirm the exceed efficiency of our scheme compared to alternatives.

  TL;DR:  We show that probabilistic circuits can be overconfident and not robust to out-of-distribution data, and we overcome this challenge by introducing a tractable sampling-free inference procedure to estimate model uncertainty.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are models that allow exact and tractable probabilistic inference. In contrast to neural networks, they are often assumed to be well-calibrated and robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we show that PCs are in fact not robust to OOD data, i.e., they don't know what they don't know. We then show how this challenge can be overcome by model uncertainty quantification. To this end, we propose tractable dropout inference (TDI), an inference procedure to estimate uncertainty by deriving an analytical solution to Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) through variance propagation. Unlike MCD in neural networks, which comes at the cost of multiple network evaluations, TDI provides tractable sampling-free uncertainty estimates in a single forward pass. TDI improves the robustness of PCs to distribution shift and OOD data, demonstrated through a series of experiments evaluating the classification confidence and uncertainty estimates on real-world data.

    Abstract:   
 Much research in deep learning is devoted to developing new model and training procedures. On the other hand, training objectives received much less attention and are often restricted to combinations of standard losses. When the objective aligns well with the evaluation metric, this is not a major issue. However when dealing with complex structured outputs, the ideal objective can be hard to optimize and the efficacy of usual objectives as a proxy for the true objective can be questionable. In this work, we argue that the existing inference network based structured prediction methods~\citep{tu-18, tu2020improving} are indirectly learning to optimize a dynamic loss objective parameterized by the energy model. We then explore using implicit-gradient based technique to learn the corresponding dynamic objectives. Our experiments show that implicitly learning a dynamic loss landscape is an effective method for improving model performance in structured prediction.

  TL;DR:  We propose a theory-driven improvement of Mixup, which is theoretically and empirically validated to be effective.   Abstract:   
 Mixup is a popular data augmentation technique for training deep neural networks where additional samples are generated by linearly interpolating pairs of inputs and their labels. This technique is known to improve the generalization performance in many learning paradigms and applications. In this work, we first analyze Mixup and show that it implicitly regularizes infinitely many directional derivatives of all orders. Based on this new insight, we propose an improved version of Mixup, theoretically justified to deliver better generalization performance than the vanilla Mixup. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments across various domains such as images, tabular data, speech, and graphs. Our results show that the proposed method improves Mixup across various datasets using a variety of architectures, for instance, exhibiting an improvement over Mixup by 0.8% in ImageNet top-1 accuracy.

  TL;DR:  We propose a contrastive whole-output explanation method for image classification.   Abstract:   
 Explanations for the outputs of deep neural network classifiers are essential in promoting trust and comprehension among users. Conventional methods often offer explanations only for one single class in the output and neglect other classes with high probabilities, resulting in a limited view of the model's behaviors. In this paper, we propose a holistic explanation method for image classification. It not only facilitates an overall understanding of model behavior, but also provides a framework where one can examine the evidence for discriminating competing classes, and thereby yield contrastive explanations. We demonstrate the advantages of the new method over baselines in terms of both faithfulness to the model and interpretability to users. The source code will be made available to the public upon publication of the paper.

  TL;DR:  Better joint predictions lead to better decisions in deep RL.   Abstract:   
 Thompson sampling (TS) is a popular heuristic for action selection, but it requires sampling from a posterior distribution. Unfortunately, this can become computationally intractable in complex environments, such as those modeled using neural networks. Approximate posterior samples can produce effective actions, but only if they reasonably approximate joint predictive distributions of outputs across inputs. Notably, accuracy of marginal predictive distributions does not suffice. Epistemic neural networks (ENNs) are designed to produce accurate joint predictive distributions. We compare a range of ENNs through computational experiments that assess their performance in approximating TS across bandit and reinforcement learning environments. The results indicate that ENNs serve this purpose well and illustrate how the quality of joint predictive distributions drives performance. Further, we demonstrate that the \textit{epinet} --- a small additive network that estimates uncertainty --- matches the performance of large ensembles at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. This enables effective application of TS with computation that scales gracefully to complex environments.

 Felix Schur, Parnian Kassraie, Jonas Rothfuss, Andreas Krause  

  TL;DR:  We meta-learn sparse kernels for lifelong optimization of linear bandits with oracle-optimal regret guarantee.   Abstract:   
 Machine learning algorithms are often repeatedly applied to problems with similar structure over and over again. We focus on solving a sequence of bandit optimization tasks and develop LIBO, an algorithm which adapts to the environment by learning from past experience and becomes more sample-efficient in the process. We assume a kernelized structure where the kernel is unknown but shared across all tasks. LIBO sequentially meta-learns a kernel that approximates the true kernel and solves the incoming tasks with the latest kernel estimate. Our algorithm can be paired with any kernelized or linear bandit algorithm and guarantees oracle optimal performance, meaning that as more tasks are solved, the regret of LIBO on each task converges to the regret of the bandit algorithm with oracle knowledge of the true kernel. Naturally, if paired with a sublinear bandit algorithm, LIBO yields a sublinear lifelong regret. We also show that direct access to the data from each task is not necessary for attaining sublinear regret. We propose F-LIBO, which solves the lifelong problem in a federated manner. 
 ID: 139 | Learning Nonlinear Causal Effect via Kernel Anchor Regression   
  
 Wenqi Shi, Wenkai Xu  

    Abstract:   
 Learning causal effects is a fundamental problem in science. Anchor regression has been developed to address this problem for a large class of causal graphical models, though the relationships between the variables are assumed to be linear. In this work, we tackle the nonlinear setting by proposing kernel anchor regression (KAR). Beyond a classic two-stage least square (2SLS) estimator, we also study an improved variant that involves nonparametric kernel regression in three separate stages. We provide convergence results for the proposed KAR estimators and the identifiability conditions for KAR to learn the nonlinear structural equation models (SEM). Experimental results demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed KAR estimators over existing baselines.

  TL;DR:  We propose amortizing hyperparameter inference for GP's over the combined space of kernel structures and datasets.   Abstract:   
 Learning the kernel parameters for Gaussian processes is often the computational bottleneck in applications such as online learning, Bayesian optimization, or active learning. Amortizing parameter inference over different datasets is a promising approach to dramatically speed up training time. However, existing methods restrict the amortized inference procedure to a fixed kernel structure. The amortization network must be redesigned manually and trained again in case a different kernel is employed, which leads to a large overhead in design time and training time. We propose amortizing kernel parameter inference over a complete kernel-structure-family rather than a fixed kernel structure. We do that via defining an amortization network over pairs of datasets and kernel structures. This enables fast kernel inference for each element in the kernel family without retraining the amortization network. As a by-product, our amortization network is able to do fast ensembling over kernel structures. In our experiments, we show drastically reduced inference time combined with competitive test performance for a large set of kernels and datasets.

 Michael Rotman, Amit Dekel, Ran Ilan Ber, Lior Wolf, Yaron Oz  

    Abstract:   
 The evolution of many dynamical systems is generically governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), whose solution, in a simulation framework, requires vast amounts of computational resources. In this work, we present a novel method that combines a hyper-network solver with a Fourier Neural Operator architecture. Our method treats time and space separately and as a result, it successfully propagates initial conditions in continuous time steps by employing the general composition properties of the partial differential operators. Following previous works, supervision is provided at a specific time point. We test our method on various time evolution PDEs, including nonlinear fluid flows in one, two, or three spatial dimensions. The results show that the new method improves the learning accuracy at the time of the supervision point, and can interpolate the solutions to any intermediate time. 
 ID: 144 | Modified Retrace for Off-Policy Temporal Difference Learning   
  
 Xingguo Chen, Xingzhou Ma, Yang Li, Guang Yang, Shangdong Yang, Yang Gao  

  TL;DR:  We proposed modified retrace to measure the off-policyness between the target policy and the behavior policy, and obtained a convergence guarantee.   Abstract:   
 Off-policy learning is a key to extend reinforcement learning as it allows to learn a target policy from a different behavior policy that generates the data. However, it is well known as ``the deadly triad'' when combined with bootstrapping and function approximation. Retrace is an efficient and convergent off-policy algorithm with tabular value functions which employs truncated importance sampling ratios. Unfortunately, Retrace is known to be unstable with linear function approximation. In this paper, we propose modified Retrace to correct the off-policy return, derive a new off-policy temporal difference learning algorithm (TD-MRetrace) with linear function approximation, and obtain a convergence guarantee under standard assumptions in both prediction and control cases. Experimental results on counterexamples and control tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with traditional algorithms. 
 ID: 147 | Learning in Online MDPs: Is there a Price for Handling the Communicating Case?   
  
 Gautam Chandrasekaran, Ambuj Tewari  

  TL;DR:  We design a low regret online learning algorithm for communicating MDPs   Abstract:   
 It is a remarkable fact that the same $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret rate can be achieved in both the Experts Problem and the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit problem albeit with a worse dependence on number of actions in the latter case. In contrast, it has been shown that handling online MDPs with communicating structure and bandit information incurs $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ regret even in the case of deterministic transitions. Is this the price we pay for handling communicating structure or is it because we also have bandit feedback? In this paper we show that with full information, online MDPs can still be learned at an $O(\sqrt{T})$ rate even in the presence of communicating structure. We first show this by proposing an efficient follow the perturbed leader (FPL) algorithm for the deterministic transition case. We then extend our scope to consider stochastic transitions where we first give an inefficient $O(\sqrt{T})$-regret algorithm (with a mild additional condition on the dynamics). Then we show how to achieve $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{T}{\alpha}}\right)$ regret rate using an oracle-efficient algorithm but with the additional restriction that the starting state distribution has mass at least $\alpha$ on each state.

  TL;DR:  We examine the uncertainty deficit of Variational Inference when using a factorized Gaussian approximation.   Abstract:   
 When factorized approximations are used for variational inference (VI), they tend to understimate the uncertainty---as measured in various ways---of the distributions they are meant to approximate. We consider two popular ways to measure the uncertainty deficit of VI: (i) the degree to which it underestimates the componentwise variance, and (ii) the degree to which it underestimates the entropy. To better understand these effects, and the relationship between them, we examine an informative setting where they can be explicitly (and elegantly) analyzed: the approximation of a Gaussian,~$p$, with a dense covariance matrix, by a Gaussian,~$q$, with a diagonal covariance matrix. We prove that $q$ always underestimates both the componentwise variance and the entropy of $p$, \textit{though not necessarily to the same degree}. Moreover we demonstrate that the entropy of $q$ is determined by the trade-off of two competing forces: it is decreased by the shrinkage of its componentwise variances (our first measure of uncertainty) but it is increased by the factorized approximation which delinks the nodes in the graphical model of $p$. We study various manifestations of this trade-off, notably one where, as the dimension of the problem grows, the per-component entropy gap between $p$ and $q$ becomes vanishingly small even though $q$ underestimates every componentwise variance by a constant multiplicative factor. We also use the shrinkage-delinkage trade-off to bound the entropy gap in terms of the problem dimension and the condition number of the correlation matrix of $p$. Finally we present empirical results on both Gaussian and non-Gaussian targets, the former to validate our analysis and the latter to explore its limitations. 
 ID: 150 | Mixture of Normalizing Flows for European Option Pricing   
  
 Yongxin Yang, Timothy Hospedales  

    Abstract:   
 We present a mixture of normalizing flows (MoNF) approach to European option pricing with guarantees that its estimations are free from static arbitrage. In contrast to many existing methods that meet economic rationality constraints (e.g., non-arbitrage) by introducing auxiliary losses, our solution meets those constraints exactly by design. To achieve this, we propose to build a model for risk neutral density using normalizing flows, which results in a pricing model, instead of modelling the option pricing function directly. First, we convert the constraints for the direct pricing models to the constraints for models backed by risk neutral density estimation, then we design a specific NF architecture that meets these constraints. Furthermore, we find that employing a mixture of such normalizing flows improves the performance significantly, compared to using a deeper single NF. Finally, we present a mechanism to regularise the proposed model, and this regularisation can serve as a bridge between our method and any sample-based mathematical finance method. The evaluations on five option datasets show superiority of our method compared to mathematical finance solutions and some other neural networks based methods.

 Hanyu Peng, Guanhua Fang, Ping Li  

  TL;DR:  Towards an end-to-end feature selection with copula to explore feature correlation   Abstract:   
 Instance-wise feature selection and ranking methods can achieve a good selection of task-friendly features for each sample in the context of neural networks. However, existing approaches that assume feature subsets to be independent are imperfect when considering the dependency between features. To address this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Gaussian copula, a powerful mathematical technique for capturing correlations between variables, into the current feature selection framework with no additional changes needed. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, in terms of performance comparison and interpretability, demonstrate that our method is capable of capturing meaningful correlations.

    Abstract:   
 Imbalanced data is ubiquitous in machine learning, such as medical or fine-grained image datasets. The existing continual learning methods employ various techniques such as balanced sampling to improve classification accuracy in this setting. However, classification accuracy is not a suitable metric for imbalanced data, and hence these methods may not obtain a good classifier as measured by other metrics (e.g., Area under the ROC Curve). In this paper, we propose a solution to enable efficient imbalanced continual learning by designing an algorithm to effectively maximize one widely used metric in an imbalanced data setting: Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). We find that simply replacing accuracy with AUC will cause \textit{gradient interference problem} due to the imbalanced data distribution. To address this issue, we propose a new algorithm, namely DIANA, which performs a novel synthesis of model \underline{D}ecoupl\underline{I}ng \underline{AN}d \underline{A}lignment. In particular, the algorithm updates two models simultaneously: one focuses on learning the current knowledge while the other concentrates on reviewing previously-learned knowledge, and the two models gradually align during training.The results show that DIANA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the imbalanced datasets.

  TL;DR:  A new framework Fastap to handle the situation where the teammates policy suffer from sudden change within one episode in cooperative MARL.   Abstract:   
 In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where an agent coordinates with teammate(s) for a shared goal, it may sustain non-stationary caused by the policy change of teammates. Prior works mainly concentrate on the policy change during the training phase or teammates altering cross episodes, ignoring the fact that teammates may suffer from policy change suddenly within an episode, which might lead to miscoordination and poor performance as a result. We formulate the problem as an open Dec-POMDP, where we control some agents to coordinate with uncontrolled teammates, whose policies could be changed within one episode. Then we develop a new framework Fast teammates adaptation (Fastap) to address the problem. Concretely, we first train versatile teammates' policies and assign them to different clusters via the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). Then, we train the controlled agent(s) to coordinate with the sampled uncontrolled teammates by capturing their identifications as context for fast adaptation. Finally, each agent applies its local information to anticipate the teammates' context for decision-making accordingly. This process proceeds alternately, leading to a robust policy that can adapt to any teammates during the decentralized execution phase. We show in multiple multi-agent benchmarks that Fastap can achieve superior performance than multiple baselines in stationary and non-stationary scenarios.

 Jonghu Jeong, Minyong Cho, Philipp Benz, Tae-hoon Kim  

  TL;DR:  To protect users privacy in machine learning as a service, we introduce an effective and efficient adversarial representation learning method with simple noisy features.   Abstract:   
 Recent real-world applications of deep learning have led to the development of machine learning as a service (MLaaS). However, the scenario of client-server inference presents privacy concerns, where the server processes raw data sent from the user's client device. One solution to this issue is to provide an obfuscator function to the client device using Adversarial Representation Learning (ARL). Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy-utility trade-off while overlooking the computational cost and memory burden on the client side. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient ARL method that incorporates feature noise into the ARL pipeline. We evaluated our approach on various datasets, comparing it with state-of-the-art ARL techniques. Our experimental results indicate that our method achieves better accuracy, lower computation and memory overheads, and improved resistance to information leakage and reconstruction attacks. The code is available in the supplementary and will be made public after publication.

  TL;DR:  Through a proper proposal distribution, one can efficiently and tractably marginalize out missing information in marked temporal point processes, thus allowing for accommodating partially observed sequences.   Abstract:   
 Marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) are a general class of stochastic models for modeling the evolution of events of different types (``marks'') in continuous time. These models have broad applications in areas such as medical data monitoring, financial prediction, user modeling, and communication networks. Of significant practical interest in such problems is the issue of missing or censored data over time. In this paper, we focus on the specific problem of inference for a trained MTPP model when events of certain types are not observed over a period of time during prediction. We introduce the concept of mark-censored sub-processes and use this framework to develop a novel marginalization technique for inference in the presence of censored marks. The approach is model-agnostic and applicable to any MTPP model with a well-defined intensity function. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of the method in the context of both parametric and neural MTPP models, with results across a range of datasets including data from simulated Hawkes processes, self-correcting processes, and multiple real-world event datasets.

  TL;DR:  This work presents theoretical and empirical studies about estimating individual treatment effect using knowledge transfer from the previous experience.   Abstract:   
 This work considers the problem of transferring causal knowledge between tasks for Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation. To this end, we theoretically assess the feasibility of transferring ITE knowledge and present a practical framework for efficient transfer. A lower bound is introduced on the ITE error of the target task to demonstrate that ITE knowledge transfer is challenging due to the absence of counterfactual information. Nevertheless, we establish generalization upper bounds on the counterfactual loss and ITE error of the target task, demonstrating the feasibility of ITE knowledge transfer. Subsequently, we introduce a framework with a new Causal Inference Task Affinity (CITA) measure for ITE knowledge transfer. Specifically, we use CITA to find the closest source task to the target task and utilize it for ITE knowledge transfer. Empirical studies are provided, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method. We observe that ITE knowledge transfer can significantly (up to 95%) reduce the amount of data required for ITE estimation.

    Abstract:   
 Identifying the causes of an event, also termed as causal attribution, is a commonly encountered task in many application problems. Available methods, mostly in Bayesian or causal inference literature, suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) cannot attributing for individuals, (2) attributing one single cause at a time and cannot deal with the interaction effect among multiple causes. In this paper, based on our proposed new measurement, called conditional counterfactual causality effect (CCCE), we introduce an individual causal attribution method, which is able to utilize the individual observation as the evidence and consider common influence and interaction effect of multiple causes simultaneously. We discuss the identifiability of CCCE and also give the identification formulas under proper assumptions. Finally, we conduct experiments on simulated and real data to illustrate the effectiveness of CCCE and the results show that our proposed method outperforms significantly over state-of-the-art methods.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We provide the better rates for variance reduced random reshuffling methods.   Abstract:   
 Virtually all state-of-the-art methods for training supervised machine learning models are variants of SGD, enhanced with a number of additional tricks, such as minibatching, momentum, and adaptive stepsizes. However, one of the most basic questions in the design of successful SGD methods, one that is orthogonal to the aforementioned tricks, is the choice of the next training data point to be learning from. Standard variants of SGD employ a sampling with replacement strategy, which means that the next training data point is sampled from the entire data set, often independently of all previous samples. While standard SGD is well understood theoretically, virtually all widely used machine learning software is based on sampling without replacement as this is often empirically superior. That is, the training data is randomly shuffled/permuted, either only once at the beginning, strategy known as random shuffling (RS), or before every epoch, strategy known as random reshuffling (RR), and training proceeds in the data order dictated by the shuffling. RS and RR strategies have for a long time remained beyond the reach of theoretical analysis that would satisfactorily explain their success. However, very recently, Mishchenko et al. [2020] provided tight sublinear convergence rates through a novel analysis, and showed that these strategies can improve upon standard SGD in certain regimes. Inspired by these results, we seek to further improve the rates of shuffling-based methods. In particular, we show that it is possible to enhance them with a variance reduction mechanism, obtaining linear convergence rates. To the best of our knowledge, our linear convergence rates are the best for any method based on sampling without replacement. 
 ID: 205 | A Bayesian Approach for Bandit Online Optimization with Switching Cost   
  
 Zai Shi, Jian Tan, Feifei Li  

    Abstract:   
 As a classical problem, online optimization with switching cost has been studied for a long time due to its wide applications in various areas. However, few works have investigated the bandit setting where both the forms of the main cost function $f(x)$ evaluated at state $x$ and the switching cost function $c(x, y)$ of transitioning from state $x$ to $y$ are unknown. In this paper, we consider the situation when $\left(f(x_t)+\varepsilon_t,\, c(x_t, x_{t-1})\right)$ can be observed with noise $\varepsilon_t$ after making a decision $x_t$ at time $t$, aiming to minimize the expected total cost within a time horizon. To solve this problem, we propose two algorithms from a Bayesian approach, named Greedy Search and Alternating Search, respectively. They have different theoretical guarantees of competitive ratios under mild regularity conditions, and the latter algorithm achieves a faster running speed. Using simulations of two classical black-box optimization problems, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms compared with the classical method.

  TL;DR:  We study the impact of context inference error and partial observability on policy learning for adaptive health interventions.   Abstract:   
 Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) are a class of personalized health interventions developed within the behavioral science community. JITAIs aim to provide the right type and amount of support by iteratively selecting a sequence of intervention options from a pre-defined set of components in response to each individual's time varying state. In this work, we explore the application of reinforcement learning methods to the problem of learning intervention option selection policies. We study the effect of context inference error and partial observability on the ability to learn effective policies. Our results show that the propagation of uncertainty from context inferences is critical to improving intervention efficacy as context uncertainty increases, while policy gradient algorithms can provide remarkable robustness to partially observed behavioral state information. 
 ID: 212 | Monte-Carlo Search for an Equilibrium in Dec-POMDPs   
  
 YANG YOU, Vincent Thomas, Francis Colas, Olivier Buffet  

    Abstract:   
 Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) formalize the problem of designing individual controllers for a group of collaborative agents under stochastic dynamics and partial observability. Seeking a global optimum is difficult (NEXP complete), but seeking a Nash equilibrium ‚Äî each agent policy being a best response to the other agents ‚Äî is more accessible, and allowed addressing infinite-horizon problems with solutions in the form of finite state controllers. In this paper, we show that this approach can be adapted to cases where only a generative model (a simulator) of the Dec-POMDP is available. This requires relying on a simulation-based POMDP solver to construct an agent‚Äôs FSC node by node. A related process is used to heuristically derive initial FSCs. Experiment with benchmarks shows that MC-JESP is competitive with existing Dec-POMDP solvers, even better than many offline methods using explicit models. 
 ID: 213 | Benign Overfitting in Adversarially Robust Linear Classification   
  
 Jinghui Chen, Yuan Cao, Quanquan Gu  

    Abstract:   
 ``Benign overfitting'', where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series of works have provided theoretical justification for over-parameterized linear regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if benign overfitting can occur in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e., examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples, on subGaussian mixture data. In detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations. Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks, despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings. 
 ID: 214 | Solving Multi-Model MDPs by Policy Gradient and Dynamic Programming   
  
 Xihong Su, Marek Petrik  

    Abstract:   
 Multi-model Markov decision process(MMDP) is a promising framework for computing policies that are robust to parameter uncertainty in MDPs. MMDPs aim to find a policy that maximizes the expected return over a distribution of MDP models. Because MMDPs are NP-hard to solve, most methods resort to approximations. In this paper, we derive the policy gradient of MMDPs and propose CADP, which combines a coordinate ascent method and a dynamic programming algorithm for solving MMDPs. The main innovation of CADP compared with earlier algorithms is to take the policy gradient perspective to adjust model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy improvements to a local maximum. A theoretical analysis of CADP proves that it never performs worse than previous dynamic programming algorithms like WSU. Our numerical results indicate that CADP substantially outperforms existing methods on several benchmark problems.

  TL;DR:  We develop a method for drawing exponentially many samples of latent variables for use in Reweighted wake-sleep.   Abstract:   
 Reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) is a machine learning method for performing Bayesian inference in a very general class of models. RWS draws $K$ samples from an underlying approximate posterior, then uses importance weighting to provide a better estimates of the true posterior. RWS then updates its approximate posterior towards the importance-weighted estimate of the true posterior. However, recent work (Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2018) indicates that the number of samples required for effective importance weighting is $\mathcal{O}(e^n)$, where $n$ is the number of latent variables. Attaining such a large number of importance samples is intractable in all but the smallest models. Here, we develop massively parallel RWS, which circumvents this issue by drawing $K$ samples of all $n$ latent variables, and individually reasoning about all $K^n$ possible combinations of samples. While reasoning about $K^n$ combinations might seem intractable, the required computations can be performed in polynomial time by exploiting conditional independencies in the generative model. We show considerable improvements over standard "global" RWS, which draws $K$ samples from the full joint.

  TL;DR:  A novel Deep Offline Reinforcement learning Negotiating Agent (DOREA) framework can learn a strategy from offline dataset and adapt it to opponent changes.   Abstract:   
 Learning is crucial for automated negotiation, and recent years have witnessed a remarkable achievement in application of reinforcement learning (RL) for various negotiation tasks. Conventional RL methods focus generally on learning from active interactions with opposing negotiators. However, collecting online data is expensive in many realistic negotiation scenarios. While previous studies partially mitigate this problem through the use of opponent simulators (i.e., agents following known strategies), in reality it is usually hard to fully capture an opponent‚Äôs negotiation strategy. Moreover, a further challenge lies in an agent's capability of adapting to dynamic variations of an opponent‚Äôs preferences or strategy, which may happen from time to time for different reasons in subsequent negotiations. In response to these challenges, this article proposes a novel Deep Offline Reinforcement learning Negotiating Agent (DOREA) framework that allows to learn an effective strategy using previously collected negotiation datasets without requiring interaction with an opponent. This is in contrast to existing RL-based negotiation approaches that all rely on active interaction with opponents. Furthermore, the strategy fine-tuning mechanism is included to adjust the learned strategy in response to the preferences or strategy changes of the opponent. The performance of the DOREA framework is evaluated based on a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines under different settings. Experimental results show that the proposed framework allows to learn effective strategies exclusively with offline datasets, and is also capable of effectively adapting to changes of an opponent's negotiation preferences or strategy.

  TL;DR:  To remedy the overfitting issues in deep kernels, we propose utilizing infinite-width neural networks to guide their optimization process and retain their Bayesian merits.   Abstract:   
 Combining Gaussian processes with the expressive power of deep neural networks is commonly done nowadays through deep kernel learning (DKL). Unfortunately, due to the kernel optimization process, this often results in losing their Bayesian benefits. In this study, we present a novel approach for learning deep kernels by utilizing infinite-width neural networks. We propose to use the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) model as a guide to the DKL model in the optimization process. Our approach harnesses the reliable uncertainty estimation of the NNGPs to adapt the DKL target confidence when it encounters novel data points. As a result, we get the best of both worlds, we leverage the Bayesian behavior of the NNGP, namely its robustness to overfitting, and accurate uncertainty estimation, while maintaining the generalization abilities, scalability, and flexibility of deep kernels. Empirically, we show on multiple benchmark datasets of varying sizes and dimensionality, that our method is robust to overfitting, has good predictive performance, and provides reliable uncertainty estimations.

  TL;DR:  We introduce a new single-object geospatial tracking dataset from a distributed camera network and present a modeling framework that considers uncertainties for this task.   Abstract:   
 Visual object tracking has seen significant progress in recent years. However, the vast majority of this work focuses on tracking objects within the image plane of a single camera and ignores the uncertainty associated with predicted object locations. In this work, we focus on the geospatial object tracking problem using data from a distributed camera network. The goal is to predict an object's track in geospatial coordinates along with uncertainty over the object's location while respecting communication constraints that prohibit centralizing raw image data. We present a novel single-object geospatial tracking data set that includes high-accuracy ground truth object locations and video data from a network of four cameras. We present a modeling framework for addressing this task including a novel backbone model and explore how uncertainty calibration and fine-tuning through a differentiable tracker affect performance.

  TL;DR:  A multi-view graph contrasting learning (MVGCL) approach to tackle out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) issue in routing problem, which couples a graph pattern learner in a self-supervised fashion with deep reinforcement learning.   Abstract:   
 Recently, neural heuristics based on deep learning have reported encouraging results for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs), especially on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) instances, e.g. uniform. However, in the presence of a distribution shift for the testing instances, their performance becomes considerably inferior. In this paper, we propose a multi-view graph Contrastive learning (MVGCL) approach to enhance the generalization across different distributions, which exploits two graph pattern learners in a self-supervised fashion to facilitate a neural heuristic equipped with an active search scheme. Specifically, we first propose two augmentation methods that are specially designed for routing problems, and our MVGCL leverages graph contrastive learning to extract transferable patterns from VRP graphs to attain the generalizable multi-view (i.e. node and graph) representation. Then it adopts the learnt node embedding and graph embedding to assist the neural heuristic and the active search (during inference) for route construction, respectively. Extensive experiments on randomly generated VRP instances from various distributions, and the ones from TSPLib and CVRPLib show that our MVGCL is superior to the baselines in boosting the cross-distribution generalization performance.

  TL;DR:  DeepSeaProbLog: a neural probabilistic logic programming language with discrete and continuous random variables.   Abstract:   
 Neural-symbolic AI (NeSy) allows neural networks to exploit symbolic background knowledge in the form of logic. It has been shown to aid learning in the limited data regime and to facilitate inference on out-of-distribution data. Probabilistic NeSy focuses on integrating neural networks with both logic and probability theory, which additionally allows learning under uncertainty. A major limitation of current probabilistic NeSy systems, such as DeepProbLog, is their restriction to finite probability distributions, i.e., discrete random vari- ables. In contrast, deep probabilistic programming (DPP) excels in modelling and optimising continuous probability distributions. Hence, we introduce DeepSeaProbLog, a neural probabilistic logic programming language that incorporates DPP techniques into NeSy. Doing so results in the support of inference and learning of both discrete and continuous probability distributions under logical constraints. Our main contributions are 1) the semantics of DeepSeaProbLog and its corresponding inference algorithm, 2) a proven asymptotically unbiased learning algorithm, and 3) a series of experiments that illustrate the versatility of our approach.

  TL;DR:  We consider a generalization of stochastic dominance to handle data with non-standard scale of measurement and introduce corresponding (regularized and/or robustified) statistical tests.   Abstract:   
 Spaces with locally varying scale of measurement, like multidimensional structures with differently scaled dimensions, are pretty common in statistics and machine learning. Nevertheless, it is still understood as an open question how to exploit the entire information encoded in them properly. We address this problem by considering an order based on (sets of) expectations of random variables mapping into such non-standard spaces. This order contains stochastic dominance and expectation order as extreme cases when no, or respectively perfect, cardinal structure is given. We derive a (regularized) statistical test for such generalized stochastic dominance, operationalize it by linear optimization, and robustify it by imprecise probability models. Our findings are illustrated with data from multidimensional poverty measurement, finance, and medicine. 
 ID: 235 | On the Limitations of Markovian Rewards to Express Multi-Objective, Risk-Sensitive, and Modal Tasks   
  
 Joar Max Viktor Skalse, Alessandro Abate  

  TL;DR:  We study three classes of tasks (multi-objective tasks, risk-sensitive tasks, and modal tasks), and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when these tasks can be expressed using scalar, Markovian reward functions.   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we study the expressivity of scalar, Markovian reward functions in Reinforcement Learning (RL), and identify several limitations to what they can express. Specifically, we look at three classes of RL tasks (multi-objective RL, risk-sensitive RL, and modal RL), and show that most of the instances in each of these three classes cannot be expressed using scalar, Markovian rewards. Among these three classes, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when a problem can be reduced to ordinary, scalar reward reinforcement learning. Modal problems have so far not been given any systematic treatment in the RL literature; we thus call attention to them as a new class of problems. Finally, we also show that many of these problems can be solved by means of bespoke RL approaches: this rules out the possibility that those problems that cannot be expressed using Markovian reward functions also are impossible to learn effectively. 
 ID: 236 | Generating Synthetic Datasets by Interpolating along Generalized Geodesics   
  
 Jiaojiao Fan, David Alvarez-Melis  

  TL;DR:  We generate synthetic datasets by interpolating along generalized geodesics, so as to improve the transfer learning performance.   Abstract:   
 Data for pretraining machine learning models often consists of collections of heterogeneous datasets. Although training on their union is reasonable in agnostic settings, it might be suboptimal when the target domain ---where the model will ultimately be used--- is known in advance. In that case, one would ideally pretrain only on the dataset(s) most similar to the target one. Instead of limiting this choice to those datasets already present in the pretraining collection, here we explore extending this search to all datasets that can be synthesized as `combinations' of them. We define such combinations as multi-dataset interpolations, formalized through the notion of generalized geodesics from optimal transport (OT) theory. We compute these geodesics using a recent notion of distance between labeled datasets, and derive alternative interpolation schemes based on it: using either barycentric projections or optimal transport maps, the latter computed using recent neural OT methods. These methods are scalable, efficient, and ---notably--- can be used to interpolate even between datasets with distinct and unrelated label sets. Through various experiments in transfer learning in computer vision, we demonstrate this is a promising new approach for targeted on-demand dataset synthesis. 
 ID: 240 | Multi-modal Differentiable Unsupervised Feature Selection   
  
 Junchen Yang, Ofir Lindenbaum, Yuval Kluger, Ariel Jaffe  

    Abstract:   
 Multi-modal high throughput biological data presents a great scientific opportunity and a significant computational challenge. In multi-modal measurements, every sample is observed simultaneously by two or more sets of sensors. In such settings, many observed variables in both modalities are often nuisance and do not carry information about the phenomenon of interest. Here, we propose a multi-modal unsupervised feature selection framework: identifying informative variables based on coupled high-dimensional measurements. Our method is designed to identify features associated with two types of latent low-dimensional structures: (i) shared structures that govern the observations in both modalities, and (ii) differential structures that appear in only one modality. To that end, we propose two Laplacian-based scoring operators. We incorporate the scores with differentiable gates that mask nuisance features and enhance the accuracy of the structure captured by the graph Laplacian. The performance of the new scheme is illustrated using synthetic and real datasets, including an extended biological application to single-cell multi-omics.

  TL;DR:  Efficient private stochastic nonconvex optimization algorithm with improved utility guarantees   Abstract:   
 While many solutions for privacy-preserving convex empirical risk minimization (ERM) have been developed, privacy-preserving nonconvex ERM remains a challenge. We study nonconvex ERM, which takes the form of minimizing a finite-sum of nonconvex loss functions over a training set. We propose a new differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm for nonconvex ERM that achieves strong privacy guarantees efficiently, and provide a tight analysis of its privacy and utility guarantees, as well as its gradient complexity. Our algorithm reduces gradient complexity while matching the best-known utility guarantee. Our experiments on benchmark nonconvex ERM problems demonstrate superior performance in terms of both training cost and utility gains compared with previous differentially private methods using the same privacy budgets. 
 ID: 246 | Two-stage Kernel Bayesian Optimization in High Dimensions   
  
 Jian Tan, Niv Nayman  

    Abstract:   
 Bayesian optimization is a popular method for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Yet it oftentimes struggles in high dimensions, where the computation could be prohibitively heavy. While a complex kernel with many length scales is prone to overfitting and expensive to train, a simple coarse kernel with too few length scales cannot effectively capture the variations of the high dimensional function in different directions. To alleviate this problem, we introduce CobBO: a Bayesian optimization algorithm with two-stage kernels and a coordinate backoff stopping rule. It adaptively selects a promising low dimensional subspace and projects past measurements into it using a computational efficient coarse kernel. Within the subspace, the computational cost of conducting Bayesian optimization with a more flexible and accurate kernel becomes affordable and thus a sequence of consecutive observations in the same subspace are collected until a stopping rule is met. Extensive evaluations show that CobBO finds solutions comparable to or better than other state-of-the-art methods for dimensions ranging from tens to hundreds, while reducing both the trial complexity and computational costs.

    Abstract:   
 We consider transferability estimation, the problem of estimating how well deep learning models transfer from a source to a target task. We focus on regression tasks, which received little previous attention, and propose two simple and computationally efficient approaches that estimate transferability based on the negative regularized mean squared error of a linear regression model. We prove novel theoretical results connecting our approaches to the actual transferability of the optimal target models obtained from the transfer learning process. Despite their simplicity, our approaches significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art regression transferability estimators in both accuracy and efficiency. On two large-scale keypoint regression benchmarks, our approaches yield 9% to 26% better results on average while being at least 27% faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.

  TL;DR:  We bound the estimated causal effects of continuous-valued treatments when they might be biased by hidden confounders.   Abstract:   
 Inferring causal effects of continuous-valued treatments from observational data is a crucial task promising to better inform policy- and decision-makers. A critical assumption needed to identify these effects is that all confounding variables---causal parents of both the treatment and the outcome---are included as covariates. Unfortunately, given observational data alone, we cannot know with certainty that this criterion is satisfied. Sensitivity analyses provide principled ways to give bounds on causal estimates when confounding variables are hidden. While much attention is focused on sensitivity analyses for discrete-valued treatments, much less is paid to continuous-valued treatments. We present novel methodology to bound both average and conditional average continuous-valued treatment-effect estimates when they cannot be point identified due to hidden confounding. A semi-synthetic benchmark on multiple datasets shows our method giving tighter coverage of the true dose-response curve than a recently proposed continuous sensitivity model and baselines. Finally, we apply our method to a real-world observational case study to demonstrate the value of identifying dose-dependent causal effects. 
 ID: 250 | Accelerating Voting by Quantum Computation   
  
 Ao Liu, Qishen Han, Lirong Xia, Nengkun Yu  

  TL;DR:  We accelerate voting by leveraging quantum computing.   Abstract:   
 Studying the computational complexity of determining winners under voting rules and designing fast algorithms are classical and fundamental questions in computational social choice. In this paper, we accelerate voting by leveraging quantum computing. We propose a quantum voting algorithm that can be applied to any anonymous voting rule. We further show that our algorithm can be quadratically faster than any classical sampling algorithm under a wide range of common voting rules, including plurality, Borda, Copeland, and STV. Precisely, our quantum voting algorithm achieves an accuracy of at least $1 - \varepsilon$ with runtime $\Theta\left(\frac{n\cdot\log(1/\varepsilon)}{\text{MOV}}\right)$, where $n$ is the number of votes and $\text{MOV}$ is margin of victory, the smallest number of voters to change the winner. On the other hand, any classical voting algorithm based on sampling a subset of voting achieves the same accuracy with runtime $\Theta\left(\frac{n^2\cdot\log(1/\varepsilon)}{\text{MOV}^2}\right)$ [Bhattacharyya and Dey, 2021]. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments under the plurality and Borda rule. 
 ID: 251 | Merging Models Pre-Trained on Different Features with Consensus Graph   
  
 Tengfei Ma, Trong Nghia Hoang, Jie Chen  

  TL;DR:  We develop a new representation consensus technique that helps combining pre-trained models with different feature spaces.   Abstract:   
 Learning an effective global model on private and decentralized datasets has become an increasingly important challenge of machine learning when applied in practice. Existing distributed learning paradigms, such as Federated Learning, enable this via model aggregation which enforces a strong form of modeling homogeneity and synchronicity across clients. This is however not suitable to many practical scenarios. For example, in distributed sensing, heterogeneous sensors reading data from different views of the same phenomenon would need to use different models for different data modalities. Local learning therefore happens in isolation but inference requires merging the local models to achieve consensus. To enable consensus among local models, we propose a feature fusion approach that extracts local representations from local models and incorporates them into a global representation that improves the prediction performance. Achieving this requires addressing two non-trivial problems. First, we need to learn an alignment between similar feature components which are arbitrarily arranged across clients to enable representation aggregation. Second, we need to learn a consensus graph that captures the high-order interactions between local feature spaces and how to combine them to achieve a better prediction. This paper presents solutions to these problems and demonstrates them in real-world applications such as power grids and traffic networks. 
 ID: 255 | Posterior Sampling-based Online Learning for the Stochastic Shortest Path Model   
  
 Mehdi Jafarnia-Jahromi, Liyu Chen, Rahul Jain, Haipeng Luo  

  TL;DR:  The first posterior sampling algorithm for online learning in stochastic shortest path models with near-optimal regret and excellent empirical performance   Abstract:   
 We consider the problem of online reinforcement learning for the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem modeled as an unknown MDP with an absorbing state. We propose \ssp, a simple posterior sampling-based reinforcement learning algorithm for the SSP problem. The algorithm operates in epochs. At the beginning of each epoch, a sample is drawn from the posterior distribution on the unknown model dynamics, and the optimal policy with respect to the drawn sample is followed during that epoch. An epoch completes if either the number of visits to the goal state in the current epoch exceeds that of the previous epoch, or the number of visits to any of the state-action pairs is doubled. We establish a Bayesian regret bound of $\tilde{O}(B S\sqrt{AK})$, where $B$ is an upper bound on the expected cost of the optimal policy, $S$ is the size of the state space, $A$ is the size of the action space, and $K$ is the number of episodes. The algorithm only requires the knowledge of the prior distribution, and has no hyper-parameters to tune. It is the first such posterior sampling algorithm and outperforms numerically previously proposed optimism-based algorithms.

  TL;DR:  Synthetic labels used in mixup are not consistently aligned with human perceptual judgments; relabeling examples, with humans-in-the-loop and leveraging human uncertainty information, holds promise to increase downstream model reliability.   Abstract:   
 Aligning model representations to humans has been found to improve robustness and generalization. However, such methods often focus on standard observational data. Synthetic data is proliferating and powering many advances in machine learning; yet, it is not always clear whether synthetic labels are perceptually aligned to humans -- rendering it likely model representations are not human aligned. We focus on the synthetic data used in mixup: a powerful regularizer shown to improve model robustness, generalization, and calibration. We design a comprehensive series of elicitation interfaces, which we release as HILL MixE Suite, and recruit 159 participants to provide perceptual judgments along with their uncertainties, over mixup examples. We find that human perceptions do not consistently align with the labels traditionally used for synthetic points, and begin to demonstrate the applicability of these findings to potentially increase the reliability of downstream models, particularly when incorporating human uncertainty. We release all elicited judgments in a new data hub we call H-Mix.

  TL;DR:  This paper introduces RPOSST, an algorithm for composing efficient, robust, reusable tests of candidate deployment RL policies by selecting a small number of the most useful test cases.   Abstract:   
 Modern reinforcement learning systems produce many high-quality policies throughout the learning process. However, to choose which policy to actually deploy in the real world, they must be tested under an intractable number of environmental conditions. We introduce RPOSST, an algorithm to select a small set of test cases from a larger pool based on a relatively small number of sample evaluations. RPOSST treats the test case selection problem as a 2-player game and optimizes a solution with provable $k$-of-$N$ robustness, bounding the error relative to a test that used all the test cases in the pool. Empirical results demonstrate that RPOSST finds a small set of test cases that identify high quality policies in a toy one-shot game, poker datasets, and a high-fidelity racing simulator.

 [spotlight]

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we analyse the effect of the convolution operator on the embedding geometry.   Abstract:   
 By recursively summing node features over entire neighborhoods, spatial graph convolution operators have been heralded as key to the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Yet, despite the multiplication of GNN methods across tasks and applications, the effect of this aggregation operation has yet to be analyzed. In fact, while most recent efforts in the GNN community have focused on optimizing the architecture of the neural network, fewer works have attempted to characterize (a) the different classes of spatial convolution operators, (b) their impact on the geometry of the embedding space, and (c) how the choice of a particular convolution should relate to properties of the data. In this paper, we propose to answer all three questions by dividing existing operators into two main classes (symmetrized vs. row-normalized spatial convolutions), and show how these correspond to different implicit biases on the data. Finally, we show that this convolution operator is in fact tunable, and explicit regimes in which certain choices of convolutions --- and therefore, embedding geometries --- might be more appropriate.

  TL;DR:  We formulated the ordinal classification task in the conformal risk control framework, provided theoretic risk bounds, proposed two types of loss functions, developed corresponding algorithms, and evaluated the method on 3 datasets.   Abstract:   
 As a natural extension to the standard conformal prediction method, several conformal risk control methods have been recently developed and applied to various learning problems. In this work, we seek to control the conformal risk in expectation for ordinal classification tasks, which have broad applications to many real problems. For this purpose, we firstly formulated the ordinal classification task in the conformal risk control framework, and provided theoretic risk bounds of the risk control method. Then we proposed two types of loss functions specially designed for ordinal classification tasks, and developed corresponding algorithms to determine the prediction set for each case to control their risks at a desired level. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and analyzed the difference between the two types of risks on three different datasets, including a simulated dataset, the UTKFace dataset and the diabetic retinopathy detection dataset.

 We provide an intuitive new algorithm for blackbox stochastic optimization of unimodal functions, a function class that we observe empirically can capture hyperparameter-tuning loss surfaces.

 ID: 273 | Adaptive Conditional Quantile Neural Processes   
  
 Peiman Mohseni, Nick Duffield, Bani Mallick, Arman Hasanzadeh  

    Abstract:   
 Neural processes are a family of probabilistic models that inherit the flexibility of neural networks to parameterize stochastic processes. Despite providing well-calibrated predictions, especially in regression problems, and quick adaptation to new tasks, the Gaussian assumption that is commonly used to represent the predictive likelihood fails to capture more complicated distributions such as multimodal ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Conditional Quantile Neural Processes (CQNPs), a new member of the neural processes family, which exploits the attractive properties of quantile regression in modeling the distributions irrespective of their form. By introducing an extension of quantile regression where the model learns to focus on estimating informative quantiles, we show that the sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy can be further enhanced. Our experiments with real and synthetic datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in predictive performance compared to the baselines, and better modeling of heterogeneous distributions' characteristics such as multimodality.

  TL;DR:  Development of event sampling algorithm allowing implementation of PDMP samplers for Bayesian neural networks.   Abstract:   
 Inference on modern Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) often relies on a variational inference treatment, imposing violated assumptions of independence and the form of the posterior. Traditional MCMC approaches avoid these assumptions at the cost of increased computation due to its incompatibility to subsampling of the likelihood. New Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP) samplers permit subsampling, though introduce a model specific inhomogenous Poisson Process (IPPs) which is difficult to sample from. This work introduces a new generic and adaptive thinning scheme for sampling from these IPPs, and demonstrates how this approach can accelerate the application of PDMPs for inference in BNNs. Experimentation illustrates how inference with these methods is computationally feasible, can improve predictive accuracy, MCMC mixing performance, and provide informative uncertainty measurements when compared against other approximate inference schemes.

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm (PERIL) for knowledge-based SDM that learns from interaction experience to reason about contextual knowledge.   Abstract:   
 Sequential decision-making (SDM) methods enable AI agents to compute an action policy toward achieving long-term goals under uncertainty. Existing research has shown that contextual knowledge in declarative forms can be used for improving the performance of SDM methods. However, the contextual knowledge from people tends to be incomplete and sometimes inaccurate, which greatly limits the applicability of knowledge-based SDM methods. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for knowledge-based SDM, called PERIL, that learns from interaction experience to reason about contextual knowledge, as applied to urban driving scenarios. Experiments have been conducted using CARLA, a widely used autonomous driving simulator. Results demonstrate PERIL's superiority in comparison to existing knowledge-based SDM baselines.

  TL;DR:  We design and analyze best-arm identification algorithms for the setting where reward variances are not equal.   Abstract:   
 We study the problem of best-arm identification (BAI) in the fixed-budget setting with heterogeneous reward variances. We propose two variance-adaptive BAI algorithms for this setting: SHVar for known reward variances and SHAdaVar for unknown reward variances. Our algorithms rely on non-uniform budget allocations among the arms where the arms with higher reward variances are pulled more often than those with lower variances. The main algorithmic novelty is in the design of SHAdaVar, which allocates budget greedily based on overestimating the unknown reward variances. We bound probabilities of misidentifying the best arms in both SHVar and SHAdaVar. Our analyses rely on novel lower bounds on the number of pulls of an arm that do not require closed-form solutions to the budget allocation problem. Since one of our budget allocation problems is analogous to the optimal experiment design with unknown variances, we believe that our results are of a broad interest. Our experiments validate our theory, and show that SHVar and SHAdaVar outperform algorithms from prior works with analytical guarantees. 
 ID: 290 | Convergence Rates for Localized Actor-Critic in Networked Markov Potential Games   
  
 Zhaoyi Zhou, Zaiwei Chen, Yiheng Lin, Adam Wierman  

  TL;DR:  We design a localized actor-critic algorithm for networked Markov potential games with provable finite-time convergence guarantees.   Abstract:   
 We introduce a class of networked Markov potential games where agents are associated with nodes in a network, each agent has its own local potential function, and the rewards of each agent depend only on the states and actions of agents within a $\kappa$-hop neighborhood. In this context, we propose a localized actor-critic policy. The policy is scalable since each agent uses only local information and does not need access to the global state. Further, the policy avoids the curse of dimensionality through the use of function approximation. Our main results provide finite-sample guarantees. We prove an $\mathcal{O}(1/M^{1/4})$ rate of convergence of the averaged Nash regret up to a critic error and a localization error, where $M$ is the total iteration number. This is the first finite-sample bound for multi-agent competitive games that does not depend on the number of agents.

 Kernel techniques are among the most popular and powerful approaches of data science. Among the key features that make kernels ubiquitous are (i) the number of domains they have been designed for, (ii) the Hilbert structure of the function class associated to kernels facilitating their statistical analysis, and (iii) their ability to represent probability distributions without loss of information. These properties give rise to the immense success of Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) which is able to capture joint independence of random variables under mild conditions, and permits closed-form estimators with quadratic computational complexity (w.r.t.\ the sample size). In order to alleviate the quadratic computational bottleneck in large-scale applications, multiple HSIC approximations have been proposed, however these estimators are restricted to $M=2$ random variables, do not extend naturally to the $M\ge 2$ case, and lack theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose an alternative Nyström-based HSIC estimator which handles the $M\ge 2$ case, prove its consistency, and demonstrate its applicability in multiple contexts, including synthetic examples, dependency testing of media annotations, and causal discovery.

  TL;DR:  By convex relaxations of distributional discrepancy optimizations, our method quantifies how close a chain of models approximates a real-world system.   Abstract:   
 Assessing the validity of a real-world system with respect to given quality criteria is a common yet costly task in industrial applications due to the vast number of required real-world tests. Validating such systems by means of simulation offers a promising and less expensive alternative, but requires an assessment of the simulation accuracy and therefore end-to-end measurements. Additionally, covariate shifts between simulations and actual usage can cause difficulties for estimating the reliability of such systems. In this work, we present a validation method that propagates bounds on distributional discrepancy measures through a composite system, thereby allowing us to derive an upper bound on the failure probability of the real system from potentially inaccurate simulations. Each propagation step entails an optimization problem, where -- for measures such as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- we develop tight convex relaxations based on semidefinite programs. We demonstrate that our propagation method yields valid and useful bounds for composite systems exhibiting a variety of realistic effects. In particular, we show that the proposed method can successfully account for data shifts within the experimental design as well as model inaccuracies within the simulation. 
 ID: 298 | Group Equivariant Vision Transformer   
  
 Renjun Xu, Kaifan Yang, Ke Liu, Fengxiang He  

  TL;DR:  We prove that previous attempts on designing group-equivariant ViT not effective in some cases, which is then addressed by a novel, effective equivariant positional encoding.   Abstract:   
 Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable performance in computer vision. However, positional encoding in ViT makes it substantially difficult to realize the equivariance, compared to models based on convolutional operations which are translation-equivariant. Initial attempts have been made on designing equivariant ViT but proved not effective in some cases in this paper. To address this issue, we propose a Group Equivariant Vision Transformer (GE-ViT) via a novel, effective positional encoding operation. We prove that GE-ViT meets all the theoretical requirements of an equivariant neural network. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on standard benchmark datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that GE-ViT has made significant improvement over non-equivariant self-attention networks. The code will be released publicly.

    Abstract:   
 Physically adversarial attacks can mislead detectors in the real world and have attracted increasing attention. However, most existing works directly manipulate the model‚Äôs final outputs as attack objects while ignoring the inherent characteristics of objects such as multi-scale features, which are easily trapped into model-specific local optimum and degrade the transferability. To address this issue, we propose the Multi-scale Feature-aware Attack (MFA) to generate adversarial camouflages with strong attacking ability and transferability by disrupting multi-scale object-aware critical features. Specifically, we adopt the location and category information of the detector outputs to assign attribution scores to different scale feature layers. Then, we weight each feature according to their attribution results and design a pixel-level loss function in the opposite optimized direction of object detection to generate adversarial camouflages. We conduct extensive experiments in both the digital and physical world on ten detection models (e.g., the up-to-date yolov7) and significantly demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MFA. Our Code will be available at: https://github.com/ChenWen1997/MFA.

    Abstract:   
 We study causal effect estimation from a mixture of observational and interventional data in a confounded linear regression model with multivariate treatments. We show that the statistical efficiency in terms of expected squared error can be improved by combining estimators arising from both the observational and interventional setting. To this end, we derive methods based on matrix weighted linear estimators and prove that our methods are asymptotically unbiased in the infinite sample limit. This is an important improvement compared to the pooled estimator using the union of interventional and observational data, for which the bias only vanishes if the ratio of observational to interventional data tends to zero. Studies on synthetic data confirm our theoretical findings. In settings where confounding is substantial and the ratio of observational to interventional data is large, our estimators outperform a Stein-type estimator and various other baselines. 
 ID: 307 | Diversity-enhanced Probabilistic Ensemble For Uncertainty Estimation   
  
 Hanjing Wang, Qiang Ji  

    Abstract:   
 Ensemble methods combine multiple individual models for prediction, which have demonstrated their effectiveness in accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) and strong robustness. Obtaining a diverse ensemble set of model parameters results in better Bayesian model averaging performance and better approximation of the true posterior distribution of model parameters. In this paper, we propose the diversity-enhanced probabilistic ensemble method with the adaptive uncertainty-guided ensemble learning strategy for better quantifying uncertainty and further improving the model robustness. Specifically, we construct the probabilistic ensemble model by building a Gaussian distribution of the model parameters for each ensemble component using Laplacian approximation in a post-processing manner. Then a mixture of Gaussian model is established with learnable and refinable parameters in an EM-like algorithm. During ensemble training, we leverage the uncertainty estimated from previous models as guidance when training the next one such that the new model will focus more on the less explored regions by previous models. Various experiments including out-of-distribution detection and image classification under distributional shifts have demonstrated better uncertainty estimation and improved model generalization ability for our proposed method.

  TL;DR:  We introduce a method for efficient online inference with advanced and computationally costly cognitive models, enabling use of modern machine learning pipelines also in the ubiquitous cases with humans in the loop.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic user modeling is essential for building collaborative AI systems within probabilistic frameworks. However, modern advanced user models, often designed as cognitive behavior simulators, are computationally prohibitive for interactive use in cooperative AI assistants. We address this problem by introducing widely-applicable differentiable surrogates for bypassing this computational bottleneck; the surrogates enable using modern behavioral models with online computational cost which is independent of their original computational cost. We show experimentally that modeling capabilities comparable to the only available solution, existing likelihood-free inference methods, are achievable with a computational cost suitable for online applications. Finally, we demonstrate how AI-assistants can now use cognitive models for online interaction in a menu-search task, which has so far required hours of computation during interaction. 
 ID: 310 | MMEL: A Joint Learning Framework for Multi-Mention Entity Linking   
  
 Chengmei YANG, Bowei He, Yimeng Wu, Chao Xing, Lianghua He, Chen Ma  

  TL;DR:  To tackle the multi-mention entity link problem, we propose a novel method, consisting of a context-entity joint feature extraction module, a multimodal learning framework, and a multi-mention collaborative ranking method with the pairwise training.   Abstract:   
 Entity linking, bridging mentions in the contexts with their corresponding entities in the knowledge bases, has attracted wide attention due to many potential applications. Previous methods mainly focus on the single-mention scenarios and neglect the scenarios where multiple mentions exist simultaneously in the same context, which limits their performance. In fact, such multi-mention scenarios are pretty common in public datasets and real-world applications. To solve this challenge, we first propose a joint feature extraction module to learn the representations of context and entity candidates, which can take the multimodal information into consideration. Then, we design a pairwise training scheme (for training) and a multi-mention collaborative ranking method (for testing) to model the potential connections between different mentions. We evaluate our method on a public dataset and a self-constructed dataset, NYTimes-MEL, under both the text-only and multimodal settings. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can largely outperform the state-of-the-art methods, especially in multi-mention scenarios. 
 ID: 320 | Layer-wise and Dimension-wise Locally Adaptive Federated Learning   
  
 Belhal Karimi, Xiaoyun Li, Ping Li  

    Abstract:   
 In the emerging paradigm of Federated Learning (FL), large amount of clients such as mobile devices are used to train possibly high-dimensional models on their respective data. Combing (\textit{dimension-wise}) adaptive gradient methods (e.g., Adam, AMSGrad) with FL has been an active direction, which is shown to outperform traditional SGD based FL in many cases. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training federated deep neural networks, and propose a novel FL framework which further introduces \emph{layer-wise} adaptivity to the local model updates to accelerate the convergence of adaptive FL methods. Our framework includes two variants based on two recent locally adaptive federated learning algorithms. Theoretically, we provide a convergence analysis of our layer-wise FL methods, coined Fed-LAMB and Mime-LAMB, which match the convergence rate of state-of-the-art results in adaptive FL and exhibits linear speedup in terms of the number of workers. Experimental results on various datasets and models, under both IID and non-IID local data settings, show that both Fed-LAMB and Mime-LAMB achieve faster convergence speed and better generalization performance, compared to various recent adaptive FL methods. 
 ID: 322 | Energy-based Predictive Representations for Partially Observed Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Tianjun Zhang, Tongzheng Ren, Chenjun Xiao, Wenli Xiao, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Dale Schuurmans, Bo Dai  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel predictive state representation with energy-based models, that shows superior performance on POMDPs.   Abstract:   
 In real world applications, it is usually necessary for a reinforcement learning algorithm to handle the partial observability beyond Markov decision processes (MDPs). Although the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) has been precisely motivated for this requirement, such a formulation raises significant computational and statistical hardness challenges in learning and planning. In this work, we introduce the Energy-based Predictive Representation (EPR), which leads to a unified framework for practical reinforcement learning algorithm design in both MDPs and POMDPs settings, to handle the learning, exploration, and planning in a coherent way. The proposed approach relies on the powerful neural energy-based model to extract sufficient representation, from which Q-functions can be efficiently approximated. With such a representation, we develop an efficient approach for computing confidence, which allows optimism/pessimism in the face of uncertainty to be efficiently implemented in planning, hence managing the exploration versus exploitation tradeoff. An experimental investigation shows that the proposed algorithm can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both MDP and POMDP settings in comparison to existing baselines. 
 ID: 325 | Incentivising Diffusion while Preserving Differential Privacy   
 [spotlight]  
 Fengjuan Jia, Mengxiao Zhang, Jiamou Liu, Bakh Khoussainov  

    Abstract:   
 Diffusion auction refers to an emerging paradigm of online marketplace where an auctioneer utilises a social network to attract potential buyers. Diffusion auction poses significant privacy risks. From the auction outcome, it is possible to infer hidden, and potentially sensitive, preferences of buyers. To mitigate such risks, we initiate the study of differential privacy (DP) in diffusion auction mechanisms. DP is a well-established notion of privacy that protects a system against inference attacks. Achieving DP in diffusion auctions is non-trivial as the well-designed auction rules are required to incentivise the buyers to truthfully report their neighbourhood. We study the single-unit case and design two differentially private diffusion mechanisms (DPDMs): recursive DPDM and layered DPDM. We prove that these mechanisms guarantee differential privacy, incentive compatibility and individual rationality for both valuations and neighbourhood. We then empirically compare their performance on real and synthetic datasets. 
 ID: 328 | Learning To Invert: Simple Adaptive Attacks for Gradient Inversion in Federated Learning   
  
 Ruihan Wu, Xiangyu Chen, Chuan Guo, Kilian Q Weinberger  

    Abstract:   
 Gradient inversion attack enables recovery of training samples from model gradients in federated learning (FL), and constitutes a serious threat to data privacy. To mitigate this vulnerability, prior work proposed both principled defenses based on differential privacy, as well as heuristic defenses based on gradient compression as countermeasures. These defenses have so far been very effective, in particular those based on gradient compression that allow the model to maintain high accuracy while greatly reducing the effectiveness of attacks. In this work, we argue that such findings underestimate the privacy risk in FL. As a counterexample, we show that existing defenses can be broken by a simple adaptive attack, where a model trained on auxiliary data is able to invert gradients on both vision and language tasks. 
 ID: 332 | Approximating Probabilistic Explanations via Supermodular Minimization   
  
 Louenas Bounia, Frederic M Koriche  

  TL;DR:  In the setting of probabilistic explanations, we propose two greedy approximation algorithms for minimizing explanation errors subject to a cardinality constraint.   Abstract:   
 Explaining in accurate and intelligible terms the predictions made by classifiers is a key challenge of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). To this end, an abductive explanation for the output $h(x)$ of some data instance $x$, given a classifier $h$, is a subset-minimal collection of features $I$ such that the restriction of $x$ to $I$ is sufficient to determine $h(x)$. Yet, due to cognitive limitations, abductive explanations are often too large to be interpretable, and in those cases, we need to identify a subset $S$ of $I$ of size at most $k$ that determines $h(x)$ with high probability. In this paper, we show that finding such probabilistic explanations is NP-hard, even for decision trees. In order to circumvent this issue, we investigate the approximability of probabilistic explanations through the lens of supermodularity. We examine both greedy descent and greedy ascent methods for supermodular minimization, whose approximation guarantees depend on the curvature of the ``unnormalized'' error function that evaluates the precision of $S$. Based on various experiments for explaining decision tree predictions, we show that our greedy algorithms provide an efficient alternative to the state-of-the-art constraint optimization method. 
 ID: 341 | Stochastic Graphical Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards   
  
 Yutian Gou, Jinfeng Yi, Lijun Zhang  

    Abstract:   
 We consider stochastic graphical bandits, where after pulling an arm, the decision maker observes rewards of not only the chosen arm but also its neighbors in a feedback graph. Most of existing work assumes that the rewards are drawn from bounded or at least sub-Gaussian distributions, which however may be violated in many practical scenarios such as social advertising and financial markets. To settle this issue, we investigate stochastic graphical bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the distributions have finite moments of order $1+\epsilon$, for some $\epsilon\in(0, 1]$. Firstly, we develop one UCB-type algorithm, whose expected regret is upper bounded by a sum of gap-based quantities over the \textit{clique covering} of the feedback graph. The key idea is to estimate the reward means of the selected arm's neighbors by more refined robust estimators, and to construct a graph-based upper confidence bound for selecting candidates. Secondly, we design another elimination-based strategy and improve the regret bound to a gap-based sum with size controlled by the \textit{independence number} of the feedback graph. For benign graphs, the \textit{independence number} could be smaller than the size of the \textit{clique covering}, resulting in tighter regret bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments on synthetic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

  TL;DR:  We present new algorithms for learning, sampling and counting Bayesian networks parameterized by the vertex cover number.   Abstract:   
 The problem of structure learning in Bayesian networks asks for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that maximizes a given scoring function. Since the problem is NP-hard, research effort has been put into discovering restricted classes of DAGs for which the search problem can be solved in polynomial time. Here, we initiate investigation of questions that have received less attention thus far: Are the known polynomial algorithms close to the best possible, or is there room for significant improvements? If the interest is in Bayesian learning, that is, in sampling or weighted counting of DAGs, can we obtain similar complexity results? Focusing on DAGs with bounded vertex cover number‚Äìa class studied in Korhonen and Parviainen's seminal work (NIPS 2015)‚Äìwe answer the questions in the affirmative. We also give, apparently the first, proof that the counting problem is #P-hard in general. In addition, we show that under the vertex-cover constraint counting is #W[1]-hard. 
 ID: 351 | Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Shared and Individual Sources   
  
 Teodora Pandeva, Patrick Forré  

    Abstract:   
 Independent component analysis (ICA) is a blind source separation method for linear disentanglement of independent latent sources from observed data. We investigate the special setting of noisy linear ICA where the observations are split among different views, each receiving a mixture of shared and individual sources. We prove that the corresponding linear structure is identifiable, and the sources distribution can be recovered. To computationally estimate the sources, we optimize a constrained form of the joint log-likelihood of the observed data among all views. We show empirically that our objective recovers the sources also in the case when the measurements are corrupted by noise. Furthermore, we propose a model selection procedure for recovering the number of shared sources which we verify empirically. Finally, we apply the proposed model in a challenging real-life application, where the estimated shared sources from two large transcriptome datasets (observed data) provided by two different labs (two different views) lead to recovering biologically meaningful (shared) sources utilized for finding a plausible representation of the underlying graph structure.

  TL;DR:  We present faster inference algorithms for probabilistic generating circuits and study the hardness of parameter learning.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic generating circuits (PGCs) are economical representations of multivariate probability generating polynomials (PGPs). They unify and extend decomposable probabilistic circuits and determinantal point processes, admitting tractable computation of marginal probabilities. However, the need for addition and multiplication of high-degree polynomials incurs a significant additional factor in the complexity of inference. Here, we give a new inference algorithm that eliminates this extra factor. Specifically, we show that it suffices to keep track of the highest degree coefficients of the computed polynomials, rendering the algorithm linear in the circuit size. In addition, we show that determinant-based circuits need not be expanded to division-free circuits, but can be handled by division-based fast algorithms. While these advances enhance the appeal of PGCs, we also discover an obstacle to learning them from data: it is NP-hard to recognize whether a given PGC encodes a PGP. We discuss the implications of our ambivalent findings and sketch a method, in which learning is restricted to PGCs that are composed of moderate-size subcircuits.

 [spotlight]

  TL;DR:  This work proposes a deep learning method for simulatenously approximating intractable likelihood functions and posterior densities arising in surrogate modeling and simulation-based inference.   Abstract:   
 This work proposes "jointly amortized neural approximation" (JANA) of intractable likelihood functions and posterior densities arising in Bayesian surrogate modeling and simulation-based inference. We train three complementary networks in an end-to-end fashion: 1) a summary network to compress individual data points, sets, or time series into informative embedding vectors; 2) a posterior network to learn an amortized approximate posterior; and 3) a likelihood network to learn an amortized approximate likelihood. Their interaction opens a new route to amortized marginal likelihood and posterior predictive estimation - two important ingredients of Bayesian workflows that are often too expensive for standard methods. We benchmark the fidelity of JANA on a variety of simulation models against state-of-the-art Bayesian methods and propose a powerful and interpretable diagnostic for joint calibration. In addition, we investigate the ability of recurrent likelihood networks to emulate complex time series models without resorting to hand-crafted summary statistics.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We propose approximate Bayes optimal selection of pseudo-samples in self-training to address the confirmation bias.   Abstract:   
 Semi-supervised learning by self-training heavily relies on pseudo-label selection (PLS). The selection often depends on the initial model fit on labeled data. Early overfitting might thus be propagated to the final model by selecting instances with overconfident but erroneous predictions, often referred to as confirmation bias. This paper introduces BPLS, a Bayesian framework for PLS that aims to mitigate this issue. At its core lies a criterion for selecting instances to label: an analytical approximation of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples. We derive this selection criterion by proving Bayes optimality of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples. We further overcome computational hurdles by approximating the criterion analytically. Its relation to the marginal likelihood allows us to come up with an approximation based on Laplace's method and the Gaussian integral. We empirically assess BPLS for parametric generalized linear and non-parametric generalized additive models on simulated and real-world data. When faced with high-dimensional data prone to overfitting, BPLS outperforms traditional PLS methods. 
 ID: 358 | Probabilistic Multi-Dimensional Classification   
  
 Vu-Linh Nguyen, Yang Yang, Cassio de Campos  

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we present a first attempt to learn probabilistic multi-dimensional classifiers which are interpretable, accurate, scalable and capable of handling mixed data.   Abstract:   
 Multi-dimensional classification (MDC) can be employed in a range of applications where one needs to predict multiple class variables for each given instance. Arguably, probabilistic MDC has been studied seldom when compared to its single class variable counterpart. Existing MDC methods often suffer from at least one of inaccuracy, scalability, limited use to certain types of data, hardness of interpretation or lack of probabilistic (uncertainty) estimations. To our best knowledge, this paper is a first attempt to address all these disadvantages simultaneously. We propose a formal framework for probabilistic MDC in which learning an optimal multi-dimensional classifier can be decomposed, without loss of generality, into learning a set of (smaller) single-variable multi-class probabilistic classifiers and a directed acyclic graph. Current and future developments of both probabilistic classification and graphical model learning can directly enhance our framework, which is flexible and provably optimal. A collection of experiments is conducted to highlight the usefulness of this MDC framework. 
 ID: 368 | A scalable Walsh-Hadamard regularizer to overcome the low-degree spectral bias of neural networks   
  
 Ali Gorji, Andisheh Amrollahi, Andreas Krause  

  TL;DR:  We empirically investigate the spectral bias of neural networks in learning only low-degree interactions and introduce a regularizer to remedy this.   Abstract:   
 Despite the capacity of neural nets to learn arbitrary functions, models trained through gradient descent often exhibit a bias towards "simpler" functions. Various notions of simplicity have been introduced to characterize this behavior. Here, we focus on the case of neural networks with discrete (zero-one) inputs through the lens of their Fourier (Walsh-Hadamard) transforms, where the notion of simplicity can be captured through the degree of the Fourier coefficients. We empirically show that neural networks have a tendency to learn lower-degree frequencies. We show how this spectral bias towards simpler features can in fact hurt the neural network's generalization on real-world datasets. To remedy this we propose a new and scalable functional regularization scheme that aids the neural network to learn higher degree frequencies. Our regularizer also helps avoid erroneous identification of low-degree frequencies, which further improves generalization. We extensively evaluate our regularizer on synthetic datasets to gain insights into its behavior. Finally, we show significantly improved generalization on four different datasets compared to standard neural networks and other relevant baselines. 
 ID: 370 | On the Role of Model Uncertainties in Bayesian Optimisation   
  
 Jonathan Foldager, Mikkel Jordahn, Lars Kai Hansen, Michael Riis Andersen  

    Abstract:   
 Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a popular method for black-box optimization, which relies on uncertainty as part of its decision-making process when deciding which experiment to perform next. However, not much work has addressed the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the BO algorithm and to what extent calibrated uncertainties improve the ability to find the global optimum. In this work, we provide an extensive study of the relationship between the BO performance (regret) and uncertainty calibration for popular surrogate models and acquisition functions, and compare them across both synthetic and real-world experiments. Our results show that Gaussian Processes, and more surprisingly, Deep Ensembles are strong surrogate models. Our results further show a positive association between calibration error and regret, but interestingly, this association disappears when we control for the type of surrogate model in the analysis. We also study the effect of recalibration and demonstrate that it generally does not lead to improved regret. Finally, we provide theoretical justification for why uncertainty calibration might be difficult to combine with BO due to the small sample sizes commonly used.

    Abstract:   
 The quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in terms of conditional entropy and mutual information, respectively, has recently become quite common in machine learning. While the properties of these measures, which are rooted in information theory, seem appealing at first glance, we identify various incoherencies that call their appropriateness into question. In addition to the measures themselves, we critically discuss the idea of an additive decomposition of total uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic constituents. Experiments across different computer vision tasks support our theoretical findings and raise concerns about current practice in uncertainty quantification.

  TL;DR:  We develop a framework to provide inter-agent privacy in multiagent systems and to synthesize policies that remain performant under private communications.   Abstract:   
 Privacy-aware multiagent systems must protect agents' sensitive data while simultaneously ensuring that agents accomplish their shared objectives. Towards this goal, we propose a framework to privatize inter-agent communications in cooperative multiagent decision-making problems. We study sequential decision-making problems formulated as cooperative Markov games with reach-avoid objectives. We apply a differential privacy mechanism to privatize agents' communicated symbolic state trajectories, and analyze tradeoffs between the strength of privacy and the team's performance. For a given level of privacy, this tradeoff is shown to depend critically upon the total correlation among agents' state-action processes. We synthesize policies that are robust to privacy by reducing the value of the total correlation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the team's performance under these policies decreases by only 6 percent when comparing private versus non-private implementations of communication. By contrast, the team's performance decreases by 88 percent when using baseline policies that ignore total correlation and only optimize team performance.

  TL;DR:  We theoretically explore adversarial imitation learning with unknown transitions.   Abstract:   
 The process of learning good policies from expert demonstrations, known as imitation learning (IL), has been proven effective in many applications. Adversarial imitation learning (AIL), a subset of IL methods, is particularly promising, but its theoretical foundation in the presence of unknown transitions has yet to be fully developed. This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of AIL in this context, where the primary challenge is the stochastic and uncertain nature of environment transitions. We examine the expert sample complexity and interaction complexity required to recover good policies, which are of great practical interest. To this end, we establish a framework connecting reward-free exploration and AIL, and propose an algorithm, MB-TAIL, that achieves the minimax optimal expert sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (H^{3/2} |\mathcal{S}|/\varepsilon)$ and interaction complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (H^{3} |\mathcal{S}|^2 |\mathcal{A}|/\varepsilon^2)$. Here, $H$ represents the planning horizon, $|\mathcal{S}|$ is the state space size, $|\mathcal{A}|$ is the action space size, and $\varepsilon$ is the desired imitation gap. MB-TAIL is the first algorithm to achieve this level of expert sample complexity in the unknown transition setting and improves upon the interaction complexity of the best-known algorithm, OAL, by $\mathcal{O} (H)$. Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization ability of MB-TAIL by extending it to the function approximation setting and proving that it can achieve expert sample and interaction complexity independent of $|\mathcal{S}|$. 
 ID: 387 | Combinatorial Categorized Bandits with Expert Rankings   
  
 Sayak Ray Chowdhury, Gaurav Sinha, Nagarajan Natarajan, Amit Sharma  

    Abstract:   
 Many real-world systems such as e-commerce websites and content-serving platforms employ two-stage recommendation --- in the first stage, multiple nominators (experts) provide ranked lists of items (one nominator per category, e.g., sports and political news articles), and in the second stage, an aggregator filters across the lists and outputs a single (short) list of $K$ items to the users. The aggregation stage can be posed as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, with the additional structure that the arms are grouped into categories (disjoint sets of items) and the ranking of arms within each category is known. We propose algorithms for selecting top $K$ items in this setting under two learning objectives, namely minimizing regret over rounds and identifying the top $K$ items within a fixed number of rounds. For each of the objectives, we provide sharp regret/error analysis using carefully defined notion of ``gap'' that exploits our problem structure. The resulting regret/error bounds strictly improve over prior work in combinatorial bandits literature. We also provide supporting evidence from simulations on synthetic and semi-synthetic problems. 
 ID: 390 | Causal Discovery for time series from multiple datasets with latent contexts   
  
 Wiebke Günther, Urmi Ninad, Jakob Runge  

    Abstract:   
 Causal discovery from time series data is a typical problem setting across the sciences. Often, multiple datasets of the same system variables are available, for instance, time series of river runoff from different catchments. The local catchment systems then share certain causal drivers, such as time-dependent large-scale weather over all catchments, but differ in other catchment-specific drivers, such as the altitude of the catchment. These drivers can be called temporal and spatial contexts, respectively, and are often partially unobserved. Pooling the datasets and considering the joint causal graph among system, context, and certain auxiliary variables enables us to overcome such latent confounding of system variables. In this work, we present a non-parametric time series causal discovery method, J(oint)-PCMCI+, that efficiently learns such joint causal time series graphs when both observed and latent contexts are present, including time lags. We present asymptotic consistency results and numerical experiments demonstrating the utility and limitations of the method. 
 ID: 392 | Increasing Effect Sizes of Pairwise Conditional Independence Tests between Random Vectors   
  
 Tom Hochsprung, Jonas Wahl, Andreas Gerhardus, Urmi Ninad, Jakob Runge  

  TL;DR:  Our paper introduces a new pairwise conditional independence testing algorithm.   Abstract:   
 A simple approach to test for conditional independence of two random vectors given a third random vector is to simultaneously test for conditional independence of every pair of components of the two random vectors given the third random vector. In this work, we show that conditioning on additional components of the two random vectors that are independent given the third one increases the tests' effect sizes while leaving the validity of the overall approach unchanged. Up to the effective reduction of the sample size due to enlarging the conditioning sets, these larger effect sizes lead to higher statistical power. We leverage this result to derive a practical pairwise testing algorithm that first chooses tests with a relatively large effect size and then does the actual testing. In simulations, our algorithm outperforms standard pairwise independence testing and other existing methods if the dependence within the two random vectors is sufficiently high. 
 ID: 394 | Causal Discovery with Hidden Confounders   
  
 David Kaltenpoth, Jilles Vreeken  

  TL;DR:  We propose a general framework for discovering latent confounders from purely observational data. We show that in the sparse linear Gaussian case, our proposed model is identifiable and permits a consistent algorithm.   Abstract:   
 Causal sufficiency is a cornerstone assumption in causal discovery. It is, however, both unlikely to hold in practice as well as unverifiable. When it does not hold, existing methods struggle to return meaningful results. In this paper, we show how to discover the causal network over both observed and unobserved variables. Moreover, we show that the causal model is identifiable in the sparse linear Gaussian case. More generally, we extend the algorithmic Markov condition to include latent confounders. We propose a consistent score based on the Minimum Description Length principle to discover the full causal network, including latent confounders. Based on this score, we develop an effective algorithm that finds those sets of nodes for which the addition of a confounding factor $Z$ is most beneficial, then fits a new causal network over both observed as well as inferred latent variables. 
 ID: 396 | When are Post-Hoc Conceptual Explanations Identifiable?   
  
 Tobias Leemann, Michael Kirchhof, Yao Rong, Enkelejda Kasneci, Gjergji Kasneci  

  TL;DR:  We derive conditions under which conceptual explanation methods recover the ground truth concepts and additionally propose two new methods for the case of dependent concept distributions.   Abstract:   
 Interest in understanding and factorizing learned embedding spaces through conceptual explanations is steadily growing. When no human concept labels are available, concept discovery methods search trained embedding spaces for interpretable concepts like object shape or color that can be used to provide post-hoc explanations for decisions. Unlike previous work, we argue that concept discovery should be identifiable, meaning that a number of known concepts can be provably recovered to guarantee reliability of the explanations. As a starting point, we explicitly make the connection between concept discovery and classical methods like Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis by showing that they can recover independent concepts with non-Gaussian distributions. For dependent concepts, we propose two novel approaches that exploit functional compositionality properties of image-generating processes. Our provably identifiable concept discovery methods substantially outperform competitors on a battery of experiments including hundreds of trained models and dependent concepts, where they exhibit up to 29 % better alignment with the ground truth. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for reliable concept discovery without human labels.

  TL;DR:  We propose data independent and data dependent algorithms for differentially private synthetic data generation whose kernel density resembles that of the real dataset.   Abstract:   
 We propose both data independent and data dependent algorithms for $\epsilon$-differentially private synthetic data generation whose kernel density resembles that of the real dataset. Creation of a synthetic dataset that faithfully represents the data distribution and simultaneously preserves privacy is a major research challenge. Many space partitioning based approaches have emerged in recent years for answering statistical queries in a differentially private manner. However, for synthetic data generation problem, recent research has been mainly focused on deep generative models. In contrast, we exploit space partitioning techniques together with noise perturbation and thus achieve intuitive and transparent algorithms. We provide theoretical results on the utility-privacy trade-offs and show how our data dependent approach overcomes the curse of dimensionality and leads to a scalable algorithm. We show empirical utility improvements over the prior work, and discuss performance of our algorithm on a downstream classification task on a real dataset.

    [slides]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Deep kernel processes are a recently introduced class of deep Bayesian models that have the flexibility of neural networks, but work entirely with Gram matrices. They operate by alternately sampling a Gram matrix from a distribution over positive semi-definite matrices, and applying a deterministic transformation. When the distribution is chosen to be Wishart, the model is called a deep Wishart process (DWP). This particular model is of interest because its prior is equivalent to a deep Gaussian process (DGP) prior, but at the same time it is invariant to rotational symmetries, leading to a simpler posterior distribution. Practical inference in the DWP was made possible in recent work ("A variational approximate posterior for the deep Wishart process" Ober and Aitchison, 2021a) where the authors used a generalisation of the Bartlett decomposition of the Wishart distribution as the variational approximate posterior. However, predictive performance in that paper was less impressive than one might expect, with the DWP only beating a DGP on a few of the UCI datasets used for comparison. In this paper, we show that further generalising their distribution to allow linear combinations of rows and columns in the Bartlett decomposition results in better predictive performance, while incurring negligible additional computation cost. 
 ID: 406 | Learning Good Interventions in Causal Graphs via Covering   
  
 Ayush Sawarni, Rahul Madhavan, Gaurav Sinha, Siddharth Barman  

  TL;DR:  State-of-the-art guarantees for the causal bandit problem   Abstract:   
 We study the causal bandit problem that entails identifying a near-optimal intervention from a specified set $\cal{A}$ of (possibly non-atomic) interventions over a given causal graph. Here, an optimal intervention in $\cal{A}$ is one that maximizes the expected value for a designated reward variable in the graph, and we use the standard notion of simple regret to quantify near optimality. Considering Bernoulli random variables and for causal graphs on $N$ vertices with constant in-degree, prior work has achieved a worst case guarantee of $\widetilde{O} (N/\sqrt{T})$ for simple regret. The current work utilizes the idea of covering interventions (which are not necessarily contained within $\cal{A}$) and establishes a simple regret guarantee of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N/T})$. Notably, and in contrast to prior work, our simple regret bound depends only on explicit parameters of the problem instance. We also go beyond prior work and achieve a simple regret guarantee for causal graphs with unobserved variables. Further, we perform experiments to show improvements over baselines in this setting.

  TL;DR:  Variable importance can be used as a distance metric for almost exact matching.   Abstract:   
 Our goal is to produce methods for observational causal inference that are auditable, easy to troubleshoot, yield accurate treatment effect estimates, and scalable to high-dimensional data. We describe a general framework called Model-to-Match that achieves these goals by (i) learning a distance metric via outcome modeling, (ii) creating matched groups using the distance metric, and (iii) using the matched groups to estimate treatment effects. Model-to-Match uses variable importance measurements to construct a distance metric, making it a flexible framework that can be adapted to various applications. Concentrating on the scalability of the problem in the number of potential confounders, we operationalize the Model-to-Match framework with LASSO. We derive performance guarantees for settings where LASSO outcome modeling consistently identifies all confounders (importantly without requiring the linear model to be correctly specified). We also provide experimental results demonstrating the auditability of matches, as well as extensions to more general nonparametric outcome modeling. 
 ID: 420 | Corrigibility: Definitions, Algorithms & Implications   
  
 Ryan Carey, Tom Everitt  

  TL;DR:  A formal analysis of algorithms that would lead to safe shutdown behaviour   Abstract:   
 How can humans stay in control of advanced artificial intelligence systems? One proposal is corrigibility, which requires the agent to follow the instructions of a human overseer, without inappropriately influencing them. In this paper, we provide the first formal definition of corrigibility, and show that it implies appropriate shutdown behavior, retention of human autonomy, and safety in low-stakes settings. We also analyse the related concepts of non-obstruction and counterfactual obedience, as well as three previously proposed corrigibility algorithms, and one new algorithm. 
 ID: 421 | Benefits of Monotonicity in Safe Exploration with Gaussian Processes   
  
 Arpan Losalka, Jonathan Scarlett  

    Abstract:   
 We consider the problem of sequentially maximising an unknown function over a set of actions while ensuring that every sampled point has a function value below a given safety threshold. We model the function using kernel-based and Gaussian process methods, while differing from previous works in our assumption that the function is monotonically increasing with respect to a safety variable. This assumption is motivated by various practical applications such as adaptive clinical trial design and robotics. Taking inspiration from the GP-UCB and SAFEOPT algorithms, we propose an algorithm, monotone safe UCB (M-SafeUCB) for this task. We show that M-SafeUCB enjoys theoretical guarantees in terms of safety, a suitably-defined regret notion, and approximately finding the entire safe boundary. In addition, we illustrate that the monotonicity assumption yields significant benefits in terms of the guarantees obtained, as well as algorithmic simplicity and efficiency. We support our theoretical findings by performing empirical evaluations on a variety of functions, including a simulated clinical trial experiment.

    [slides]   
   
  TL;DR:  This work proposes a novel method to derive efficient message passing algorithms for approximate inference on graphs with many cycles.   Abstract:   
 Message passing on factor graphs is a powerful framework for probabilistic inference, which finds important applications in various scientific domains. The most wide-spread message passing scheme is the sum-product algorithm (SPA) which gives exact results on trees but often fails on graphs with many small cycles. We search for an alternative message passing algorithm which works particularly well on such cyclic graphs. Therefore, we challenge the extrinsic principle of the SPA, which loses its purpose on graphs with cycles. We further replace the local SPA message update rule at the factor nodes of the underlying graph with a generic mapping, which is optimized in a data-driven fashion. These modifications lead to a considerable improvement of the performance, while preserving the simplicity of the SPA. We evaluate our method for two classes of cyclic graphs: the 2x2 fully connected Ising grid and factor graphs for symbol detection on linear communication channels with inter-symbol interference. To enable the method for large graphs as they occur in practical applications, we develop a novel loss function which is inspired by the Bethe approximation from statistical physics and allows for training in an unsupervised fashion.

    Abstract:   
 Under a simplified data model, this paper provides a theoretical analysis of learning from data that have an underlying low-rank tensor structure in both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the supervised setting, we provide an analysis of a Ridge classifier (with high regularization parameter) with and without knowledge of the low-rank structure of the data. Our results quantify analytically the gain in misclassification errors achieved by exploiting the low-rank structure for denoising purposes, as opposed to treating data as mere vectors. We further provide a similar analysis in the context of clustering, thereby quantifying the exact performance gap between tensor methods and standard approaches which treat data as simple vectors. 
 ID: 433 | Concurrent Misclassification and Out-of-Distribution Detection for Semantic Segmentation via Energy-Based Normalizing Flow   
  
 Denis A Gudovskiy, Tomoyuki Okuno, Yohei Nakata  

  TL;DR:  A normalizing flow model with the energy-based inputs to detect in-distribution misclassifications and out-of-distribution examples for semantic segmentation application   Abstract:   
 Recent semantic segmentation models accurately classify test-time examples that are similar to a training dataset distribution. However, their discriminative closed-set approach is not robust in practical data setups with distributional shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. As a result, the predicted probabilities can be very imprecise when used as confidence scores at test time. To address this, we propose a generative model for concurrent in-distribution misclassification (IDM) and OOD detection that relies on a normalizing flow framework. The proposed flow-based detector with an energy-based inputs (FlowEneDet) can extend previously deployed segmentation models without their time-consuming retraining. Our FlowEneDet results in a low-complexity architecture with marginal increase in the memory footprint. FlowEneDet achieves promising results on Cityscapes, Cityscapes-C, FishyScapes and SegmentMeIfYouCan benchmarks in IDM/OOD detection when applied to pretrained DeepLabV3+ and SegFormer semantic segmentation models. 
 ID: 434 | Scalable and Robust Tensor Ring Decomposition for Large-scale Data   
  
 Yicong He, George K. Atia  

    Abstract:   
 Tensor ring (TR) decomposition has recently received increased attention due to its superior expressive performance for high-order tensors. However, the applicability of traditional TR decomposition algorithms to real-world applications is hindered by prevalent large data sizes, missing entries, and corruption with outliers. In this work, we propose a scalable and robust TR decomposition algorithm capable of handling large-scale tensor data with missing entries and gross corruptions. We first develop a novel auto-weighted steepest descent method that can adaptively fill the missing entries and identify the outliers during the decomposition process. Further, taking advantage of the tensor ring model, we develop a novel fast Gram matrix computation (FGMC) approach and a randomized subtensor sketching (RStS) strategy which yield significant reduction in storage and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing TR decomposition methods in the presence of outliers, and runs significantly faster than existing robust tensor completion algorithms. 
 ID: 437 | Quantifying lottery tickets under label noise: accuracy, calibration, and complexity   
  
 Viplove Arora, Daniele Irto, Sebastian Goldt, Guido Sanguinetti  

  TL;DR:  Pruning networks with sizes ranging over orders of magnitude can be pruned to obtain small networks of comparable sizes that have low test error and good calibration.   Abstract:   
 Pruning deep neural networks is a widely used strategy to alleviate the computational burden in machine learning. Overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that pruned models retain very high accuracy even with a tiny fraction of parameters. However, relatively little work has gone into characterising the small pruned networks obtained, beyond a measure of their accuracy. In this paper, we study small networks obtained via the iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) procedure on data with label noise. We observe empirically that, for a given task, IMP tends to converge to networks of comparable sizes even when starting from full networks with sizes ranging over orders of magnitude. We analyse the best pruned models in a controlled experimental setup and show that their number of parameters reflects task difficulty and that they are much better than full networks at capturing the true conditional probability distribution of the labels. On real data, we similarly observe that pruned models are less prone to overconfident predictions. Our results suggest that pruned models obtained via IMP not only have advantageous computational properties but also provide a better representation of uncertainty in learning. 
 ID: 442 | Vacant Holes for Unsupervised Detection of the Outliers in Compact Latent Representation   
  
 Misha Glazunov, Apostolis Zarras  

  TL;DR:  A method for unsupervised outlier detection utilizing holes based on the compact latent space with constrained factors of variation   Abstract:   
 Detection of the outliers is pivotal for any machine learning model deployed and operated in real-world. It is essential for the Deep Neural Networks that were shown to be overconfident with such inputs. Moreover, even deep generative models that allow estimation of the probability density of the input fail in achieving this task. In this work, we concentrate on the specific type of these models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). First, we unveil a significant theoretical flaw in the assumption of the classical VAE model. Second, we enforce an accommodating topological property to the image of the deep neural mapping to the latent space: compactness to alleviate the flaw and obtain the means to provably bound it within the determined limits by squeezing both inliers and outliers together. We enforce compactness using two approaches: Alexandroff extension and fixed Lipschitz continuity constant on the mapping of the encoder of the VAEs. Finally and most importantly, we discover that the anomalous inputs predominantly tend to land on the vacant latent holes within the compact space, enabling their successful identification. For that reason, we introduce a specifically devised score for hole detection and evaluate the solution against several baseline benchmarks achieving promising results.

  TL;DR:  We develop subgraph sampling procedure that is end-to-end trainable, that we train jointly with graph neural networks.   Abstract:   
 Sampling subgraphs for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is receiving much attention from the GNN community. While a variety of methods have been proposed, each method samples the graph according to its own heuristic. However, there has been little work in mixing these heuristics in an end-to-end trainable manner. In this work, we design a generative framework for graph sampling. Our method, SubMix, parameterizes graph sampling as a convex combination of heuristics. We show that a continuous relaxation of the discrete sampling process allows us to efficiently obtain analytical gradients for training the sampling parameters. Our experimental results illustrate the usefulness of learning graph sampling in three scenarios: (1) robust training of GNNs by automatically learning to discard noisy edge sources; (2) improving model performance by trainable and online edge subset selection; and (3) by integrating our framework into state-of-the-art (SOTA) decoupled GNN models, for homogeneous OGBN datasets. Our method raises the SOTA on challenging ogbn-arxiv and ogbn-products, respectively, by over 4 and 0.5 percentage points.

  TL;DR:  We show how pre-training GPT models can be accelerated by using unstructured weight sparsity to reduce the training FLOPs by up to 2.5x, while retaining the benefits of pre-trained textual representations in large language models.   Abstract:   
 The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has contributed to a number of breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Instead of directly training on a downstream task, language models are first pre-trained on large datasets with cross-domain knowledge (e.g., Pile, MassiveText, etc.) and then fine-tuned on task-specific data (e.g., natural language generation, text summarization, etc.). Scaling the model and dataset size has helped improve the performance of LLMs, but unfortunately, this also lead to highly prohibitive computational costs. Pre-training LLMs often require orders of magnitude more FLOPs than fine-tuning and the model capacity often remains the same between the two phases. To achieve training efficiency~w.r.t training FLOPs, we propose to decouple the model capacity between the two phases and introduce Sparse Pre-training and Dense Fine-tuning (SPDF). In this work, we show the benefits of using unstructured weight sparsity to train only a subset of weights during pre-training (Sparse Pre-training) and then recover the representational capacity by allowing the zeroed weights to learn (Dense Fine-tuning). We demonstrate that we can induce up to 75\% sparsity into a 1.3B parameter GPT-3 XL model resulting in a 2.5x reduction in pre-training FLOPs, without a significant loss in accuracy on the downstream tasks relative to the dense baseline. By rigorously evaluating multiple downstream tasks, we also establish a relationship between sparsity, task complexity and dataset size. Our work presents a promising direction to train large GPT models at a fraction of the training FLOPs using weight sparsity, while retaining the benefits of pre-trained textual representations for downstream tasks.

    Abstract:   
 Control variates can be a powerful tool to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimators, but constructing effective control variates can be challenging when the number of samples is small. In this paper, we show that when a large number of related integrals need to be computed, it is possible to leverage the similarity between these integration tasks to improve performance even when the number of samples per task is very small. Our approach, called meta learning CVs (Meta-CVs), can be used for up to hundreds or thousands of tasks. Our empirical assessment indicates that Meta-CVs can lead to significant variance reduction in such settings, and our theoretical analysis establishes general conditions under which Meta-CVs can be successfully trained.

 Lucas Clarté, Bruno Loureiro, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborova  

  TL;DR:  We describe a new method to calibrate the prediction of neural networks, similar to temperature scaling   Abstract:   
 Despite their incredible performance, it is well reported that deep neural networks tend to be overoptimistic about their prediction confidence. Finding effective and efficient calibration methods for neural networks is therefore an important endeavour towards better uncertainty quantification in deep learning. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel calibration technique named expectation consistency (EC), consisting of a post-training rescaling of the last layer weights by enforcing that the average validation confidence coincides with the average proportion of correct labels. First, we show that the EC method achieves similar calibration performance to temperature scaling (TS) across different neural network architectures and data sets, all while requiring similar validation samples and computational resources. However, we argue that EC provides a principled method grounded on a Bayesian optimality principle known as the Nishimori identity. Next, we provide an asymptotic characterization of both TS and EC in a synthetic setting and show that their performance crucially depends on the target function. In particular, we discuss examples where EC significantly outperforms TS. 
 ID: 457 | Correcting for Nonignorable Selection Bias and Missing Response in Regression using Privileged Information   
  
 Philip Boeken, Arnoud De Kroon, Mathijs de Jong, Joris Mooij, Onno Zoeter  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel imputation based method that uses privileged information for correcting for selection bias or missing response. The method appropriately corrects for bias, and extrapolates better than importance weighted regression.   Abstract:   
 When estimating a regression model, we might have data where some labels are missing, or our data might be biased by a selection mechanism. When the response or selection mechanism is ignorable (i.e., independent of the response variable given the features) one can use off-the-shelf regression methods; in the nonignorable case one typically has to adjust for bias. We observe that privileged data (i.e. data that is only available during training) might render a nonignorable selection mechanism ignorable. We refer to this scenario as Privilegedly Missing at Random (PMAR). We propose a novel imputation-based regression method, named repeated regression, that is suitable for PMAR. We also consider an importance weighted regression method, and a doubly robust combination of the two. The proposed methods are easy to implement with most popular out-of-the-box regression algorithms. We empirically assess the performance of the proposed methods with extensive simulated experiments and on a synthetically augmented real-world dataset. We conclude that repeated regression can appropriately correct for bias, and can have considerable advantage over weighted regression, especially when extrapolating to regions of the feature space where response is never observed. 
 ID: 458 | Mnemonist: Locating Model Parameters that Memorize Training Examples   
  
 Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Jamie Hayes, Borja Balle, Adrian Weller  

    Abstract:   
 Recent work has shown that an adversary can reconstruct training examples given access to the parameters of a deep learning image classification model. We show that the quality of reconstruction depends heavily on the type of activation functions used. In particular, we show that ReLU activations lead to much lower quality reconstructions compared to smooth activation functions. We explore if this phenomenon is a fundamental property of models with ReLU activations, or if it is a weakness of current attack strategies. We first study the training dynamics of models with ReLU activations and identify redundant model parameters that do not memorise training examples. Building on this, we propose our Mnemonist method, which is able to detect redundant model parameters, and then guide current attacks to focus on informative parameters to improve the quality of reconstructions of training examples from ReLU models.

 Yassir Fathullah, Guoxuan Xia, Mark Gales  

  TL;DR:  Propose to distribution distill an autoregressive ensemble using a student Laplace distribution   Abstract:   
 Efficiently and reliably estimating uncertainty is an important objective in deep learning. It is especially pertinent to autoregressive sequence tasks, where training and inference costs are typically very high. However, existing research has predominantly focused on tasks with static data such as image classification. In this work, we investigate Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) applied to large-scale natural language sequence-to-sequence data. EDD aims to compress the superior uncertainty performance of an expensive (teacher) ensemble into a cheaper (student) single model. Importantly, the ability to separate knowledge (epistemic) and data (aleatoric) uncertainty is retained. Existing probability-space approaches to EDD, however, are difficult to scale to large vocabularies. We show, for modern transformer architectures on large-scale translation tasks, that modelling the ensemble \textit{logits}, instead of softmax probabilities, leads to significantly better students. Moreover, the students surprisingly even \textit{outperform Deep Ensembles} by up to $\sim$10\% AUROC on out-of-distribution detection, whilst matching them at in-distribution translation. 
 ID: 462 | Bandits with Costly Reward Observations   
  
 Aaron David Tucker, Caleb Biddulph, Claire Wang, Thorsten Joachims  

  TL;DR:  We provide algorithms, a regret lower bound, and experiments (synthetic and real data) for bandit problems where you need to pay a cost to observe the reward.   Abstract:   
 Many machine learning applications rely on large datasets that are conveniently collected from existing sources or that are labeled automatically as a by-product of user actions. However, in settings such as content moderation, accurately and reliably labeled data comes at substantial cost. If a learning algorithm has to pay for reward information, for example by asking a human for feedback, how does this change the exploration/exploitation tradeoff? We study this question in the context of bandit learning. Specifically, we investigate Bandits with Costly Reward Observations, where a cost needs to be paid in order to observe the reward of the bandit's action. We show that the observation cost implies an $\Omega(c^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ lower bound on the regret. Furthermore, we develop a general non-adaptive bandit algorithm which matches this lower bound, and we present several competitive adaptive learning algorithms for both k-armed and contextual bandits.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  Combining Gaussian processes with spectral features of attributed graphs leads to surprisingly strong performance for the task of graph classification.   Abstract:   
 Graph classification aims to categorise graphs based on their structure and node attributes. In this work, we propose to tackle this task using tools from graph signal processing by deriving spectral features within the framework of Bayesian modelling with Gaussian processes. We present two variants of spectral Gaussian processes for graph classification. The first variant uses spectral features based on the distribution of energy of a node feature signal over the spectrum of the graph. We show that even such a simple approach, having no learnt parameters, can yield competitive performance compared to strong neural network and graph kernel baselines. A second, more sophisticated variant is designed to capture multi-scale and localised patterns in the graph by learning spectral graph wavelet filters, obtaining improved performance on synthetic and real-world data sets. Finally, we show that both models produce well calibrated uncertainty estimates, enabling reliable decision making based on the model predictions. 
 ID: 466 | Provably Efficient Representation Selection in Low-rank Markov Decision Processes: From Online to Offline RL   
  
 Weitong Zhang, Jiafan He, Dongruo Zhou, Amy Zhang, Quanquan Gu  

    Abstract:   
 The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) lies in its ability to learn a representation that is well-suited for the exploration and exploitation task. To understand how the choice of representation can improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), we study representation selection for a class of low-rank Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the transition kernel can be represented in a bilinear form. We propose an efficient algorithm, called ReLEX, for representation learning in both online and offline RL. Specifically, we show that the online version of ReLEX, calledReLEX-UCB, always performs no worse than the state-of-the-art algorithm without representation selection, and achieves a strictly better constant regret if the representation function class has a "coverage" property over the entire state-action space. For the offline counterpart, ReLEX-LCB, we show that the algorithm can find the optimal policy if the representation class can cover the state-action space and achieves gap-dependent sample complexity. This is the first result with constant sample complexity for representation learning in offline RL. 
 ID: 467 | Deep Gaussian Mixture Ensembles   
  
 Yousef El-Laham, Niccolo Dalmasso, Elizabeth Fons, Svitlana Vyetrenko  

    Abstract:   
 This work introduces a novel probabilistic deep learning technique called deep Gaussian mixture ensembles (DGMEs), which enables accurate quantification of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. By assuming the data generating process follows that of a Gaussian mixture, DGMEs are capable of approximating complex probability distributions, such as heavy tailed or multimodal distributions. Our contributions include the derivation of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm used for learning the model parameters, which results in an upper-bound on the log-likelihood of training data over that of standard deep ensembles. Additionally, the proposed EM training procedure allows for learning of mixture weights, which is not commonly done in ensembles. Our experimental results demonstrate that DGMEs outperform state-of-the-art uncertainty quantifying deep learning models in handling complex predictive densities.

 Michael Y. Li, Erin Grant, Thomas L. Griffiths  

  TL;DR:  Interpretability and model selection for neural networks by learning a Gaussian process surrogate model for a neural network hyperparameter configuration.   Abstract:   
 Not being able to understand and predict the behavior of deep learning systems makes it hard to decide what architecture and algorithm to use for a given problem. In science and engineering, modeling is a methodology used to understand complex systems whose internal processes are opaque. Modeling replaces a complex system with a simpler surrogate that is more interpretable. Drawing inspiration from this, we construct a class of surrogate models for neural networks using Gaussian processes. Rather than deriving kernels for infinite neural networks, we learn kernels empirically from the naturalistic behavior of finite neural networks. We demonstrate our approach captures existing phenomena related to the spectral bias of neural networks, and then show that our surrogate models can be used to solve practical problems such as identifying which points most influence the behavior of specific neural networks and predicting which architectures and algorithms will generalize well for specific datasets. 
 ID: 472 | Residual-Based Error Bound for Physics-Informed Neural Networks   
 [spotlight]  
 Shuheng Liu, Xiyue Huang, Pavlos Protopapas  

  TL;DR:  We propose algorithms to bound error of any PINN solution to linear ODEs, certain nonlinear ODEs, and first-order linear PDEs. Only residual information and equation structure are required. No network architecture assumptions needed.   Abstract:   
 Neural networks are universal approximators and are studied for their use in solving differential equations. However, a major criticism is the lack of error bounds for obtained solutions. This paper proposes a technique to rigorously evaluate the error bound of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) on most linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), certain nonlinear ODEs, and first-order linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The error bound is based purely on equation structure and residual information and does not depend on assumptions of how well the networks are trained. We propose algorithms that bound the error efficiently. Some proposed algorithms provide tighter bounds than others at the cost of longer run time.

 Jacob Morris Chen, Daniel Malinsky, Rohit Bhattacharya  

  TL;DR:  We propose a method to estimate causal effects under outcome-dependent self-censoring and when the full structure of the causal graph is unknown.   Abstract:   
 We consider missingness in the context of causal inference when the outcome of interest may be missing. If the outcome directly affects its own missingness status, i.e., it is "self-censoring", this may lead to severely biased causal effect estimates. Miao et al., [2015] proposed the shadow variable method to correct for bias due to self-censoring, however, verifying the required model assumptions can be difficult. Here, we propose a test based on a randomized incentive variable offered to encourage reporting of the outcome that can be used to verify identification assumptions that are sufficient to correct for both self-censoring and confounding bias. Concretely, the test confirms whether a given set of pre-treatment covariates are sufficient to block all backdoor paths between the treatment and outcome as well as all paths between the treatment and missinginess indicator after conditioning on the outcome. We show that under these conditions, the causal effect is identified by using the treatment as a shadow variable, and it leads to an intuitive inverse probability weighting estimator that uses a product of the treatment and response weights. We evaluate the efficacy of our test and downstream estimator via simulations.

    Abstract:   
 Randomized experiments (REs) are the cornerstone for treatment effect evaluation. However, due to the practical considerations, REs may encounter difficulty recruiting sufficient patients. Historical controls (HCs) may supplement REs to boost estimation efficiency. Yet, it is possible that there is incomparability between HCs and CCs, resulting in misleading treatment effect evaluation. We introduce a new bias function to measure the difference between the outcome mean function between HCs and REs. We show that the ANCOVA model augmented the bias function for HCs renders a consistent estimator of the average treatment effect, regardless whether the ANCOVA model is correct or not. To accommodate possibly different structure of the ANCOVA model and the bias function, we propose a double penalty integration estimator (DPIE) with different penalization terms for the two functions. With an appropriate choice of penalty parameters, our DPIE ensures consistency, oracle property, and asymptotic normality even in the presence of model misspecification. DPIE is at least as efficient as the estimator derived from REs alone, which is validated through both theoretical and experimental results. 
 ID: 480 | Investigating a Generalization of Probabilistic Material Implication and Bayesian Conditional   
 [spotlight]  
 Matthias Scheutz, Michael Jahn  

  TL;DR:  We investigate properties of a generalized rule that subsumes probabilistic material implication and Bayesian conditionals as special cases.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic "if A then B" rules are typically formalized as Bayesian conditionals P(B|A), as many (e.g., Pearl) have argued that Bayesian conditionals are the correct way to think about such rules. However, there are challenges with standard inferences such as modus ponens and modus tollens that might make probabilistic material implication a better candidate at times for rule-based systems employing forward-chaining; and arguably material implication is still suitable when information about prior or conditional probabilities is not available at all. We investigate a generalization of probabilistic material implication and Bayesian conditionals that combines the advantages of both formalisms in a systematic way and prove basic properties of the generalized rule, in particular, for inference chains in graphs.

  TL;DR:  We show that the volume of a credal set is a good measure for epistemic uncertainty in a binary classification setting, while it ceases to be so in multi-class setting.   Abstract:   
 Adequate uncertainty representation and quantification have become imperative in various scientific disciplines, especially in machine learning and artificial intelligence. As an alternative to representing uncertainty via one single probability measure, we consider credal sets (convex sets of probability measures). The geometric representation of credal sets as $d$-dimensional polytopes implies a geometric intuition about (epistemic) uncertainty. In this paper, we show that in the case of binary classification, the volume of the geometric representation of a credal set is a good measure of epistemic uncertainty, while for multi-class classification it ceases to be appealing. Our theoretical findings highlight the crucial role of specifying and employing appropriate measures of uncertainty in machine learning tasks and generally call for awareness of possible pitfalls.

  TL;DR:  We propose the functional causal Bayesian optimization method for finding functional interventions that optimize a target variable in a known causal graph.   Abstract:   
 We propose the functional causal Bayesian optimization method (fCBO) for finding interventions that optimize a target variable in a known causal graph. fCBO extends CBO to perform, in addition to hard interventions, functional interventions which consist in setting a variable to be a deterministic function of a set of other variables in the graph. This is achieved by modelling the unknown objective with Gaussian processes whose inputs are defined in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, thus allowing to compute distances among vector-valued functions. In turn, this enables to sequentially select functions to explore by maximizing an expected improvement acquisition functional while keeping the typical computational tractability of standard BO settings. We show that functional interventions can attain better target effects compared to hard interventions and ensure that the found optimal policy is also optimal for sub-groups. We demonstrate the benefits of the method in a synthetic setting and in a real-world causal graph. 
 ID: 494 | Uniform-PAC Guarantees for Model-Based RL with Bounded Eluder Dimension   
  
 Yue Wu, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu  

  TL;DR:  We propose uniform-PAC, model-based algorithms for both bandit and episodic RL with the notion of eluder dimension.   Abstract:   
 Recently, there has been remarkable progress in reinforcement learning (RL) with general function approximation. However, all these works only provide regret or sample complexity guarantees. It is still an open question if one can achieve stronger performance guarantees, i.e., the uniform probably approximate correctness (Uniform-PAC) guarantee that can imply both a sub-linear regret bound and a polynomial sample complexity for any target learning accuracy. We study this problem by proposing algorithms for both nonlinear bandits and model-based episodic RL using the general function class with a bounded eluder dimension. The key idea of the proposed algorithms is to assign each action to different levels according to its width with respect to the confidence set. The achieved uniform-PAC sample complexity is tight in the sense that it matches the state-of-the-art regret bounds or sample complexity guarantees when reduced to the linear case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for uniform-PAC guarantees on bandit and RL that goes beyond linear cases.

 Xiaolin Sun, Jacob Masur, Ben Abramowitz, Nicholas Mattei, Zizhan Zheng  

  TL;DR:  We formalize and study a novel model of election attack, pandering, where candidates report their positions strategically and study the complexity of and algorithms for reasoning in this domain.   Abstract:   
 In representative democracies, the election of new representatives in regular election cycles is meant to prevent misbehavior by elected officials and keep them accountable to the ``will of the people." This ideal is undermined when candidates are dishonest when campaigning for election over these rounds. Much of the work on COMSOC to date has investigated strategic actions in only a single round. We introduce a novel formal model of pandering, or strategic preference reporting by candidates, and examine the resilience of two voting systems, Representative Democracy (RD) and Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD), to pandering within a single round and across multiple rounds. For each voting system, our analysis centers on the types of strategies candidates employ and how voters update their views of candidates based on how the candidates have pandered in the past. We provide theoretical results on the complexity of pandering in our setting for a single cycle, formulate our problem for multiple cycles as a Markov Decision Process, and use reinforcement learning to study the effects of pandering by both single candidates and groups of candidates across a number of rounds. 
 ID: 496 | Sample Boosting Algorithm (SamBA) - An Interpretable Greedy Ensemble Classifier Based On Local Expertise For Fat Data   
  
 Baptiste Bauvin, Cécile Capponi, Florence Clerc, Pascal Germain, Sokol Koço, Jacques Corbeil  

  TL;DR:  We porpose a framewok and an algorithm to include local knowledge in boosting, with thoeretical and experiemental guarantees.   Abstract:   
 Ensemble methods are a very diverse family of algorithms with a wide range of applications. One of the most commonly used is boosting, with the prominent Adaboost. Adaboost relies on greedily learning base classifiers that rectify the error from previous iteration. Then, it combines them through a weighted majority vote, based on their quality on the learning set. In this paper, we propose a supervised binary classification framework that propagates the local knowledge acquired during the boosting iterations to the prediction function. Based on this general framework, we introduce SamBA, an interpretable greedy ensemble method designed for fat datasets with a large number of dimensions and a small number of samples. SamBA learns local classifiers and combines them, using a similarity function, to optimize its efficiency in data extraction. We provide a theoretical analysis of SamBA, yielding convergence and generalization guarantees. In addition, we highlight SamBA's empirical behavior in an extensive experimental analysis on both real biological and generated datasets, comparing it to state-of-the-art ensemble methods and similarity-based approaches. 
 ID: 499 | Hallucinated Adversarial Control for Conservative Offline Policy Evaluation   
  
 Jonas Rothfuss, Bhavya Sukhija, Tobias Birchler, Parnian Kassraie, Andreas Krause  

  TL;DR:  A practical method for conservative off-policy evaluation, useful for safety critical applications.   Abstract:   
 We study the problem of conservative off-policy evaluation (COPE) where given an offline dataset of environment interactions, collected by other agents, we seek to obtain a (tight) lower bound on a policy's performance. This is crucial when deciding whether a given policy satisfies certain minimal performance/safety criteria before it can be deployed in the real world. To this end, we introduce HAMBO, which builds on an uncertainty-aware learned model of the transition dynamics. To form a conservative estimate of the policy's performance, HAMBO hallucinates worst-case trajectories that the policy may take, within the margin of the models' epistemic confidence regions. We prove that the resulting COPE estimates are valid lower bounds, and, under regularity conditions, show their convergence to the true expected return. Finally, we discuss scalable variants of our approach based on Bayesian Neural Networks and empirically demonstrate that they yield reliable and tight lower bounds in various continuous control environments.

 Steffen Ridderbusch, Sina Ober-Blöbaum, Paul James Goulart  

  TL;DR:  Predicting trajectories with uncertainty is challenging and we show an approximate way to do it while including correlation with past states.   Abstract:   
 Computing the distribution of trajectories from a Gaussian Process model of a dynamical system is an important challenge in utilizing such models. Motivated by the computational cost of sampling-based approaches, we consider approximations of the model's output and trajectory distribution. We show that previous work on uncertainty propagation, focussed on discrete state-space models, incorrectly included an independence assumption between subsequent states of the predicted trajectories. Expanding these ideas to continuous ordinary differential equation models, we illustrate the implications of this assumption and propose a novel piecewise linear approximation of Gaussian Processes to mitigate them.

  TL;DR:  We address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue   Abstract:   
 Proper confidence calibration of deep neural networks is essential in safety-critical tasks for reliable predictions. Miscalibration can lead to model over-confidence and/or under-confidence; i.e., the predicted confidence can be greater or less than model accuracy. Recent studies have highlighted the over-confidence issue by introducing calibration techniques and demonstrated success on various tasks. However, miscalibration through under-confidence has not yet to receive much attention. In this paper, we address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue. We first introduce a novel metric, a miscalibration score, to identify the overall and class-wise calibration status, including being over or under-confident. Our proposed metric reveals the pitfalls of existing calibration techniques, where they often overly calibrate the model and worsen under-confident predictions. Then we utilize the class-wise miscalibration score as a proxy to design a calibration technique that can tackle both over and under-confidence. We report extensive experiments that show that our proposed methods substantially outperform existing calibration techniques. We also validate the automatic failure detection of the proposed calibration technique using our class-wise miscalibration score with a risk-coverage curve. Results show that our methods significantly improve failure detection as well as trustworthiness of the model.

  TL;DR:  A new ancestral perspective on the Cyclic Equivalence Theorem leads to a simplified and much faster procedure to decide on Markov equivalence between directed cyclic graphs.   Abstract:   
 We present a new, efficient procedure to establish Markov equivalence between directed graphs that may or may not contain cycles. It is based on the Cyclic Equivalence Theorem (CET) in the seminal works on cyclic models by Thomas Richardson in the mid '90s, but now rephrased from an ancestral perspective. The resulting characterization leads to a procedure for establishing Markov equivalence between graphs that no longer requires explicit tests for \textit{d}-separation, leading to a significantly reduced algorithmic complexity. The conceptually simplified characterization may help to reinvigorate theoretical research towards sound and complete cyclic discovery in the presence of latent confounders.

 Zixin Huang, Saikat Dutta, Sasa Misailovic  

    Abstract:   
 We present the first systematic study of effectiveness of robustness transformations on a diverse set of 24 probabilistic programs representing generalized linear models, mixture models, and time-series models. We evaluate five robustness transformations from literature on each model. We quantify and present insights on (1) the improvement of the posterior prediction accuracy and (2) the execution time overhead of the robustified programs, in the presence of three input noise models. To automate the evaluation of various robustness transformations, we developed ASTRA ‚Äì a novel framework for quantifying the robustness of probabilistic programs and exploring the trade-offs between robustness and execution time. Our experimental results indicate that the existing transformations are often suitable only for specific noise models, can significantly increase execution time, and have non-trivial interaction with the inference algorithms.

  TL;DR:  Better certified segmentation leveraging randomized smoothing as well as off-the-shelf denoising diffusion and segmentation models.   Abstract:   
 The robustness of image segmentation has been an important research topic in the past few years as segmentation models have reached production-level accuracy. However, like classification models, segmentation models can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which hinders their use in critical-decision systems like healthcare or autonomous driving. Recently, randomized smoothing has been proposed to certify segmentation predictions by adding Gaussian noise to the input to obtain theoretical guarantees. Nonetheless, this method exhibits a trade-off between the amount of added noise and the level of certification achieved. In this paper, we address the problem of certifying segmentation prediction using a combination of randomized smoothing and diffusion models. Our experiments show that combining randomized smoothing and diffusion models significantly improves certified robustness, with results indicating a mean improvement of 21 points in accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on Pascal-Context and Cityscapes public datasets. Our method is independent of the selected segmentation model and does not need any additional specialized training procedure. Our pipeline and code will be made publicly available online.

    Abstract:   
 Text classifiers built on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and question-answering. However, these text classifiers sometimes make uncertain predictions, which challenges their trustworthiness during deployment in practical applications. Much effort has been devoted to designing various probes in order to understand what PLMs capture. But few works have explored factors influencing PLM-based classifiers' predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework CUE for interpreting uncertainties of PLM-based models' predictions. In particular, we first map PLM-encoded representations to a latent space via a variational auto-encoder. We then generate text representations by perturbing the latent space which causes fluctuation in predictive uncertainty. By comparing the predictive uncertainty difference between the perturbed text representation and the original text representation, we are able to identify the latent dimensions that cause uncertainty and thus trace back to input features that lead to uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for linguistic acceptability classification, emotion classification, and natural language inference show the feasibility of our proposed framework.

    Abstract:   
 The Right to Explanation is an important regulatory principle which allows individuals to request actionable explanations for algorithmic decisions. However, several technical challenges arise when providing such actionable explanations in practice. For instance, models are periodically retrained to handle dataset shifts, and this may in turn invalidate some of the previously prescribed explanations thus rendering them unactionable. But, it is unclear if and when such invalidations occur, and what factors determine explanation stability i.e., if an explanation remains unchanged amidst model retraining due to dataset shifts. In this paper, we address the aforementioned gaps and provide one of the first theoretical and empirical characterizations of the factors influencing explanation stability. To this end, we conduct rigorous theoretical analysis to demonstrate that model curvature and robustness, weight decay parameters, and the magnitude of the dataset shift are key factors that determine the extent of explanation (in)stability. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets not only validates our theoretical results, but also demonstrates that the aforementioned factors dramatically impact the stability of explanations produced by various state-of-the-art methods. 
 ID: 520 | Improvable Gap Balancing for Multi-Task Learning   
  
 Yanqi Dai, Nanyi Fei, Zhiwu Lu  

  TL;DR:  We propose two novel improvable gap balancing algorithms for multi-task learning, instead of the classic loss balancing strategy.   Abstract:   
 In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient balancing has recently attracted more research interest than loss balancing since it often leads to better performance. However, loss balancing is much more efficient than gradient balancing, and thus it is still worth further exploration in MTL. Note that prior studies typically ignore that there exist varying improvable gaps across multiple tasks, where the improvable gap per task is defined as the distance between the current training progress and desired final training progress. Therefore, after loss balancing, the performance imbalance still arises in many cases. In this paper, following the loss balancing framework, we propose two novel improvable gap balancing (IGB) algorithms for MTL: one takes a simple heuristic, and the other (for the first time) deploys deep reinforcement learning for MTL. Particularly, instead of directly balancing the losses in MTL, both algorithms choose to dynamically assign task weights for improvable gap balancing. Moreover, since IGB is shown to be complementary to gradient balancing, we also provide a fusion paradigm to combine both loss balancing and gradient balancing for MTL. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our IGB algorithms lead to the best results in MTL via loss balancing and achieve further improvements when combined with gradient balancing.

  TL;DR:  Causal perspectives to distribution shift robustness break down when we only have proxies for the causal model, but training auxiliary tasks can help.   Abstract:   
 Statistical prediction models are often trained on data that is drawn from different probability distributions than their eventual use cases. One approach to proactively prepare for these shifts harnesses the intuition that causal mechanisms should remain invariant between environments. Here we focus on a challenging setting in which the causal and anticausal variables of the target are unobserved. Leaning on information theory, we develop feature selection and engineering techniques for the observed downstream variables that act as proxies. We identify proxies that help to build stable models and moreover utilize auxiliary training tasks to extract stability-enhancing information from proxies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on synthetic and real data.

 Tesi Xiao, Xuxing Chen, Krishna Balasubramanian, Saeed Ghadimi  

    Abstract:   
 We focus on decentralized stochastic non-convex optimization, where $n$ agents work together to optimize a composite objective function which is a sum of a smooth term and a non-smooth convex term. To solve this problem, we propose two single-time scale algorithms: Prox-DASA and Prox-DASA-GT. These algorithms can find $\epsilon$-stationary points in $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1}\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations using constant batch sizes (i.e., $\mathcal{O}(1)$). Unlike prior work, our algorithms achieve a comparable complexity result without requiring large batch sizes, more complex per-iteration operations (such as double loops), or stronger assumptions. Our theoretical findings are supported by extensive numerical experiments, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over previous approaches.

 We consider the problem of increasing the expressivity of probabilistic circuits by augmenting them with the successful generative models of normalizing flows. To this effect, we theoretically establish the requirement of decomposability for such combinations to retain tractability of the learned models. Our model, called Probabilistic Flow Circuits, essentially extends circuits by allowing for normalizing flows at the leaves. Our empirical evaluation clearly establishes the expressivity and tractability of this new class of probabilistic circuits. 
 ID: 527 | A Data-Driven State Aggregation Approach for Dynamic Discrete Choice Models   
  
 Sinong Geng, houssam nassif, Charlie Manzanares  

    Abstract:   
 We study dynamic discrete choice models, where a commonly studied problem involves estimating parameters of agent reward functions (also known as "structural" parameters), using agent behavior data. Maximum likelihood estimation for such models requires dynamic programming, which incurs the curse of dimensionality [Bellman, 1957]. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that provides a data-driven method for selecting and aggregating states, which lowers the computational and sample complexity of estimation. Our method works in two stages. In the first stage, we use a flexible inverse reinforcement learning approach to estimate agent Q-functions. We use these estimated Q-functions, along with a clustering algorithm, to select a subset of states that are the most pivotal for driving changes in Q functions. In the second stage, with these selected "aggregated" states, we conduct maximum likelihood estimation using a commonly used nested fixed-point algorithm [Rust, 1987]. The proposed two-stage approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality by reducing the problem dimension. Theoretically, we derive finite-sample bounds on the associated estimation error, which also characterize the trade-off of computational complexity, estimation error, and sample complexity. We demonstrate the empirical performance of the algorithm in two classic dynamic discrete choice estimation applications.

  TL;DR:  A theoretically-sound algorithm for probabilistically robust conformal prediction which ensures robust uncertainty quantification to most perturbations around clean input examples.   Abstract:   
 Conformal prediction (CP) is a framework to quantify uncertainty of machine learning classifiers including deep neural networks. Given a testing example and a trained classifier, CP produces a prediction set of candidate labels with a user-specified coverage (i.e., true class label is contained with high probability). Almost all the existing work on CP assumes clean testing data and there is not much known about the robustness of CP algorithms w.r.t natural/adversarial perturbations to testing examples. This paper studies the problem of probabilistically robust conformal prediction (PRCP) which ensures robustness to most perturbations around clean input examples. PRCP generalizes the standard CP (cannot handle perturbations) and adversarially robust CP (ensures robustness w.r.t worst-case perturbations) to achieve better trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness. We propose a novel adaptive PRCP (aPRCP) algorithm to achieve probabilistically robust coverage. The key idea behind aPRCP is to determine two parallel thresholds, one for data samples and another one for the perturbations on data (aka "quantile-of-quantile'' design). We provide theoretical analysis to show that aPRCP algorithm achieves robust coverage. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets using deep neural networks demonstrate that aPRCP achieves better trade-offs than state-of-the-art CP and adversarially robust CP algorithms.

    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 We consider the problem of maximizing submodular functions under submodular constraints by formulating the problem in two ways: SCSK-C and Diff-C. Given two submodular functions $f$ and $g$ where $f$ is monotone, the objective of SCSK-C problem is to find a set $S$ of size at most $k$ that maximizes $f(S)$ under the constraint that $g(S)\leq \theta$, for a given value of $\theta$. The problem of Diff-C focuses on finding a set $S$ of size at most $k$ such that $h(S) = f(S)-g(S)$ is maximized. It is known that these problems are highly inapproximable and do not admit any constant factor multiplicative approximation algorithms unless NP is easy. Known approximation algorithms involve data-dependent approximation factors that are not efficiently computable. We initiate a study of the design of approximation algorithms where the approximation factors are efficiently computable. For the problem of SCSK-C, we prove that the greedy algorithm produces a solution whose value is at least $(1-1/e)f(OPT) - A$, where $A$ is the data-dependent additive error. For the Diff-C problem, we design an algorithm that uses the SCSK-C greedy algorithm as a subroutine. This algorithm produces a solution whose value is at least $(1-1/e)h(OPT)-B$, where $B$ is also a data-dependent additive error. A salient feature of our approach is that the additive error terms can be computed efficiently, thus enabling us to ascertain the quality of the solutions produced.

  TL;DR:  We propose a version of a security game that takes into account a possibility of a two-phase attack.   Abstract:   
 A standard model of a security game assumes a one-off assault during which the attacker cannot update their strategy even if new actionable insights are gained in the process. In this paper, we propose a version of a security game that takes into account a possibility of a two-phase attack. Specifically, in the first phase, the attacker makes a preliminary move to gain extra information about this particular instance of the game. Based on this information, the attacker chooses an optimal concluding move. We derive a compact-form mixed-integer linear program that computes an optimal strategy of the defender. Our simulation shows that this strategy mitigates serious losses incurred to the defender by a two-phase attack while still protecting well against less sophisticated attackers. 
 ID: 536 | Bounding the Optimal Value Function in Compositional Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Jacob Adamczyk, Volodymyr Makarenko, Argenis Arriojas, Stas Tiomkin, Rahul V Kulkarni  

  TL;DR:  We derive double-sided bounds on the optimal value function for compositions of primitive tasks.   Abstract:   
 In the field of reinforcement learning (RL), agents are often tasked with solving a variety of problems differing only in their reward functions. In order to quickly obtain solutions to unseen problems with new reward functions, a popular approach involves functional composition of previously solved tasks. However, previous work using such functional composition has primarily focused on specific instances of composition functions, whose limiting assumptions allow for exact zero-shot composition. Our work unifies these examples and provides a more general framework for compositionality in both standard and entropy-regularized RL. We find that, for a broad class of functions, the optimal solution for the composite task of interest can be related to the known primitive task solutions. Specifically, we present double-sided inequalities relating the optimal composite value function to the value functions for the primitive tasks. We also show that the regret of using a zero-shot policy can be bounded for this class of functions. The derived bounds can be used to develop clipping approaches for reducing uncertainty during training, allowing agents to quickly adapt to new tasks. 
 ID: 537 | Finite-sample Guarantees for Nash Q-learning with Linear Function Approximation

    Abstract:   
 Nash Q-learning may be considered one of the first and most known algorithms in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for learning policies that constitute a Nash equilibrium of an underlying general-sum Markov game. Its original proof was in the asymptotic domain and for the tabular case. Recently, finite-sample guarantees have been provided using more modern RL techniques for the tabular case. Our work analyzes Nash Q-learning using linear function approximation ‚Äì a representation regime introduced when the state space is large or continuous ‚Äì and provides finite-sample guarantees that indicate its sample efficiency. We find that the obtained performance nearly matches an existing efficient result for single-agent RL under the same representation and has a polynomial gap when compared to the best-known result for the tabular case.

  TL;DR:  This is the first work performing Bayesian inference on vertex-series-parallel partial orders (VSP's). We propose a prior over VSP's and extend an existing observation model for queue-like noisy rank data.   Abstract:   
 Partial orders are a natural model for the social hierarchies that may constrain ``queue-like'' rank data. However, the computational cost of counting the LE's of a general partial order on a ground set with more than a few tens of elements is prohibitive. Vertex-series-parallel partial orders (VSP's) are a subclass of partial orders which admit rapid counting and represent the sorts of relations we expect to see in a social hierarchy. However, no Bayesian analysis of VSP's has been given to date. We construct a marginally consistent family of priors over VSP's with a parameter controlling the prior distribution over VSP depth. The distribution function is given in closed form. We extend an existing observation model for queue-like rank data to represent noise in our list-data and carry out Bayesian inference on rank lists from ``Royal Acta'' data. Model comparison shows our model is a better fit to the data and also compares favorably with a Plackett-Luce mixture.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We prove a high-probability bound for the instantaneous swap regret with respect to the randmoness of both learner and adversaries.   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we study a multi-agent bandit problem in an unknown general-sum game repeated for a number of rounds~(i.e., learning in a black-box game with bandit feedback), where a set of agents have no information about the underlying game structure and cannot observe each other's actions and rewards. In each round, each agent needs to play an arm~(i.e., action) from a (possibly different) arm set~(i.e., action set), and \emph{only} receives the reward of the \emph{played} arm that is affected by other agents' actions. The objective of each agent is to minimize her own cumulative swap regret, where the swap regret is a generic performance measure for online learning algorithms. We are the first to give a near-optimal high-probability swap-regret upper bound based on a refined martingale analysis for the exponential-weighting-based algorithms with the implicit exploration technique, which can further bound the expected swap regret instead of the pseudo-regret studied in the literature. It is also guaranteed that correlated equilibria can be achieved in a polynomial number of rounds if the algorithm is played by all agents. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to verify the performance of the studied algorithm.

  TL;DR:  We propose an algorithm to learn cutset networks from sparse and noisy data using qualitative influences   Abstract:   
 Cutset networks (CNs) are interpretable probabilistic representations that combine probability trees and tree Bayesian networks, to model and reason about large multi-dimensional probability distributions. Motivated by high-stakes applications in domains such as healthcare where (a) rich domain knowledge in the form of qualitative influences is readily available and (b) use of interpretable models that the user can efficiently probe and infer over is often necessary, we focus on learning CNs in the presence of qualitative influences. We propose a penalized objective function that uses the influences as constraints, and develop a gradient-based learning algorithm, KICN. We show that because CNs are tractable, KICN is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum of the penalized objective function. Our experiments on several benchmark data sets show that our new algorithm is superior to the LearnCNet algorithm proposed in previous work, especially when the data is scarce or noisy. 
 ID: 551 | Why Out-of-Distribution Detection Experiments Are Not Reliable - Subtle Experimental Artifacts Muddle the OOD Detector Rankings   
  
 Kamil Szyc, Tomasz Walkowiak, Henryk Maciejewski  

  TL;DR:  We identify experimental artifacts in OOD detection benchmark studies, so we question the reliability of OOD detector rankings.   Abstract:   
 Reliable detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is becoming a critical requirement for machine learning systems deployed in safety-critical applications. Recently, many OOD detectors have been developed in the literature, and their performance has been evaluated using empirical studies based on well-established benchmark datasets. However, these studies do not provide a conclusive recommendation because the performance of OOD detection depends on the benchmark datasets. In this work, we want to question the reliability of the OOD detection performance numbers obtained from many of these empirical experiments. We report several experimental conditions that are not controlled and lead to significant changes in OOD detector performance and rankings of OOD methods. These include the technicalities related to how the DNN was trained (such as seed, train/test split, etc.), which do not change the accuracy of closed-set DNN models but may significantly change the performance of OOD detection methods that rely on representation from these DNNs. We performed extensive sensitivity studies to quantify the instability of OOD performance measures due to unintuitive experimental artifacts, which need to be more rigorously controlled and accounted for in many current OOD experiments. Experimental studies in OOD detection should improve methodological standards regarding experiment control and replication.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We encourage the community to view transformer-based offline reinforcement learning approach from a multimodal perspective.   Abstract:   
 Transformers hold tremendous promise in solving offline reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating it as a sequence modeling problem derived from language modeling (LM). Prior works using transformers usually model the sample trajectory of RL as one sequence analogous to one sentence in LM, despite the fact that each trajectory includes tokens from three diverse modalities: state, action, and reward while a sentence contains words only. Rather than taking a modality-agnostic approach which uniformly models the tokens from different modalities into one sequence, we propose a multimodal sequence modeling approach in which a trajectory (one sentence) of three modalities (state, action, reward) is disentangled into three uni-modal ones (three sentences). We investigate the correlation of different modalities during sequential decision-making and use the insights to design our multimodal transformer, named Decision Transducer (DTd). DTd outperforms prior art in offline RL on the D4RL benchmarks and enjoys better sample efficiency and algorithm flexibility. 
 ID: 554 | Efficiently Learning the Graph for Semi-supervised Learning   
  
 Dravyansh Sharma, Maxwell Jones  

  TL;DR:  We show how to efficiently learning the graph (Gaussian bandwidth) parameter in classic semi-supervised learning, by exploiting sparsity and conjugate gradient approximations.   Abstract:   
 Computational efficiency is a major bottleneck in using classic graph-based approaches for semi-supervised learning on datasets with a large number of unlabeled examples. Known techniques to improve efficiency typically involve an approximation of the graph regularization objective, but suffer two major drawbacks ‚Äì first the graph is assumed to be known or constructed with heuristic hyperparameter values, second they do not provide a principled approximation guarantee for learning over the full unlabeled dataset. Building on recent work on learning graphs for semi-supervised learning from multiple datasets for problems from the same domain, and leveraging techniques for fast approximations for solving linear systems in the graph Laplacian matrix, we propose algorithms that overcome both the above limitations. We show a formal separation in the learning-theoretic complexity of sparse and dense graph families. We further show how to approximately learn the best graphs from the sparse families efficiently using the conjugate gradient method. Our approach can also be used to learn the graph efficiently online with sub-linear regret, under mild smoothness assumptions. Our online learning results are stated generally, and may be useful for approximate and efficient parameter tuning in other problems. We implement our approach and demonstrate significant (~10-100x) speedups over prior work on semi-supervised learning with learned graphs on benchmark datasets. 
 ID: 555 | KrADagrad: Kronecker Approximation-Domination Gradient Preconditioned Stochastic Optimization   
  
 Jonathan Mei, Alexander Moreno, Luke Walters  

  TL;DR:  Second order optimizer that avoids matrix inversion   Abstract:   
 Second order stochastic optimizers allow parameter update step size and direction to adapt to loss curvature, but have traditionally required too much memory and compute for deep learning. Recently, Shampoo [Gupta et al., 2018] introduced a Kronecker factored preconditioner to reduce these requirements: it is used for large deep models [Anil et al., 2020] and in production [Anil et al., 2022]. However, it takes inverse matrix roots of ill-conditioned matrices. This requires 64-bit precision, imposing strong hardware constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel factorization, Kronecker Approximation-Domination (KrAD). Using KrAD, we update a matrix that directly approximates the inverse empirical Fisher matrix (like full matrix AdaGrad), avoiding inversion and hence 64-bit precision. We then propose KrADagrad$^\star$, with similar computational costs to Shampoo and the same regret. Synthetic ill-conditioned experiments show improved performance over Shampoo for 32-bit precision, while for several real datasets we have comparable or better generalization. 
 ID: 556 | Fast and Scalable Score-Based Kernel Calibration Tests   
 [spotlight]  
 Pierre Glaser, David Widmann, Fredrik Lindsten, Arthur Gretton  

  TL;DR:  We introduce a Fast and Scalable Score-Based Kernel Calibration Test.   Abstract:   
 We introduce the Kernel Calibration Conditional Stein Discrepancy test (KCCSD test), a nonparametric, kernel-based test for assessing the calibration of probabilistic models with well-defined scores. In contrast to previous methods, our test avoids the need for possibly expensive expectation approximations while providing control over its type-I error. We achieve these improvements by using a new family of kernels for score-based probabilities that can be estimated without probability density samples, and by using a Conditional Goodness of Fit criterion for the KCCSD test's U-statistic. The tractability of the KCCSD test widens the surface area of calibration measures to new promising use-cases, such as regularization during model training. We demonstrate the properties of our test on various synthetic settings. 
 ID: 558 | Neural Tangent Kernel at Initialization: Linear Width Suffices   
  
 Arindam Banerjee, Pedro Cisneros-Velarde, Libin Zhu, Misha Belkin  

    Abstract:   
 In this paper we study the problem of lower bounding the minimum eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) at initialization, an important quantity for the theoretical analysis of training in neural networks. We consider feedforward neural networks with smooth activation functions. Without any distributional assumptions on the input, we present a novel result: we show that for suitable initialization variance, $\widetilde{\Omega}(n)$ width, where $n$ is the number of training samples, suffices to ensure that the NTK at initialization is positive definite, improving prior results for smooth activations under our setting. Prior to our work, the sufficiency of linear width has only been shown either for networks with ReLU activation functions, and sublinear width has been shown for smooth networks but with additional conditions on the distribution of the data. The technical challenge in the analysis stems from the layerwise inhomogeneity of smooth activation functions and we handle the challenge using generalized Hermite series expansion of such activations. 
 ID: 559 | "Private Prediction Strikes Back!" Private Kernelized Nearest Neighbors with Individual R\'{e}nyi Filter   
 [spotlight]  
 Yuqing Zhu, Xuandong Zhao, Chuan Guo, Yu-Xiang Wang  

  TL;DR:  We propose a new private prediction mechanism that easily adapted to the changing private dataset and improve over existing private prediction methods.   Abstract:   
 Most existing approaches of differentially private (DP) machine learning focus on private training. Despite its many advantages, private training lacks the flexibility in adapting to incremental changes to the training dataset such as deletion requests from exercising GDPR‚Äôs right to be forgotten. We revisit a long-forgotten alternative, known as private prediction, and propose a new algorithm named Individual Kernelized Nearest Neighbor (Ind-KNN). Ind-KNN is easily updatable over dataset changes and it allows precise control of the R\'{e}nyi DP at an individual user level --- a user's privacy loss is measured by the exact amount of her contribution to predictions; and a user is removed if her prescribed privacy budget runs out. Our results show that Ind-KNN consistently improves the accuracy over existing private prediction methods for a wide range of $\epsilon$ on four vision and language tasks. We also illustrate several cases under which Ind-KNN is preferable over private training with NoisySGD. 
 ID: 560 | Online Heavy-tailed Change-point detection   
  
 Abishek Sankararaman, Murali Balakrishnan  

  TL;DR:  We give the first algorithm to have provable false positive rate for online change point detection with heavy tailed data   Abstract:   
 We study algorithms for online sequential change-point detection, where samples are presented one at a time, a change in the underlying mean must be detected as early as possible, and the data distribution could be heavy tailed. We present an algorithm based on clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), that works even if we only assume that the second moment of the data generating process is bounded. We derive guarantees on worst-case, finite-sample false-positive rate (FPR) over the family of all distributions with bounded second moment. Thus, our method is the first online change point detection mechanism that guarantees finite-sample FPR, even if the underlying observations are drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. The technical contribution of our paper is to show that clipped-SGD can estimate the mean of a random vector and simultaneously provide confidence bounds at all confidence values. We use this robust estimate via a simple union bound and construct a sequential change-point algorithm with finite-sample FPR guarantees. We further demonstrate through simulations that our algorithm works well in a variety of situations whether the underlying data are heavy-tailed, light-tailed, high dimensional or discrete. No other algorithm achieves bounded FPR theoretically or empirically, over all the settings we study simultaneously. 
 ID: 561 | Fairness-Aware Class Imbalanced Learning on Multiple Subgroups   
  
 Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Bojian Hou, Boning Tong, Qi Long, Li Shen  

    Abstract:   
 Overparameterized models fail to generalize well in the presence of data imbalance even when combined with standard re-weighting and margin adjustment of loss for mitigating imbalances. This concern is further exacerbated when the data contains multiple or even \textit{many} subgroups, each with a \textit{limited number of samples}. We design a Bayesian-based three-level optimization framework to improve the performance in such scenarios. In the middle and lower levels, the \textit{local} (subgroup-specific) predictors are learned through a small amount of training data and the fair and class-balanced predictor. Specifically, our lower-level formulation uses sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) algorithm to effectively escape saddle points for minority classes. The upper-level problem automatically tunes the loss function by monitoring the validation loss and updates the \textit{global} predictor to be close to all local predictors. We theoretically show that our method leads to the potentially improved generalization bound. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of our three-level framework over state-of-the-art approaches.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  This paper describes a unified active query framework that can be applied to any problem which involves learning a representation of the data that reflects similarity.   Abstract:   
 Active learning is commonly used to train label-efficient models by adaptively selecting the most informative queries. However, most active learning strategies are designed to either learn a representation of the data (e.g., embedding or metric learning) or perform well on a task (e.g., classification) on the data. However, many machine learning tasks involve a combination of both representation learning and a task-specific goal. Motivated by this, we propose a novel unified query framework that can be applied to any problem in which a key component is learning a representation of the data that reflects similarity. Our approach builds on similarity or nearest neighbor (NN) queries which seek to select samples that result in improved embeddings. The queries consist of a reference and a set of objects, with an oracle selecting the object most similar (i.e., nearest) to the reference. In order to reduce the number of solicited queries, they are chosen adaptively according to an information theoretic criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on two tasks -- active metric learning and active classification -- using a variety of synthetic and real world datasets. In particular, we demonstrate that actively selected NN queries outperform recently developed active triplet selection methods in a deep metric learning setting. Further, we show that in classification, actively selecting class labels can be reformulated as a process of selecting the most informative NN query, allowing direct application of our method. 
 ID: 567 | On the Convergence of Continual Learning with Adaptive Methods   
  
 Seungyub Han, Yeongmo Kim, Taehyun Cho, Jungwoo Lee  

    Abstract:   
 One of the objectives of continual learning is to prevent catastrophic forgetting in learning multiple tasks sequentially, and the existing solutions have been driven by the conceptualization of the plasticity-stability dilemma. However, the convergence of continual learning for each sequential task is less studied so far. In this paper, we provide a convergence analysis of memory-based continual learning with stochastic gradient descent and empirical evidence that training current tasks causes the cumulative degradation of previous tasks. We propose an adaptive method for nonconvex continual learning (NCCL), which adjusts step sizes of both previous and current tasks with the gradients. The proposed method can achieve the same convergence rate as the SGD method when the catastrophic forgetting term which we define in the paper is suppressed at each iteration. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of continual learning over existing methods for several image classification tasks. 
 ID: 571 | Robust Quickest Change Detection for Unnormalized Models   
  
 Suya Wu, Enmao Diao, Taposh Banerjee, Jie Ding, Vahid Tarokh  

  TL;DR:  We propose a new robust score-based quickest change detection algorithm that can be applied to unnormalized models.   Abstract:   
 Detecting an abrupt and persistent change in the underlying distribution of online data streams is an important problem in many applications. This paper proposes a new robust score-based algorithm called RSCUSUM, which can be applied to unnormalized models and addresses the issue of unknown post-change distributions. RSCUSUM replaces the Kullback-Leibler divergence with the Fisher divergence between pre- and post-change distributions for computational efficiency in unnormalized statistical models and introduces a notion of the ``least favorable'' distribution for robust change detection. The algorithm and its theoretical analysis are demonstrated through simulation studies. 
 ID: 576 | Identifiability and Estimation under Missing Not at Random Mechanisms   
  
 Anna Guo, Jiwei Zhao, Razieh Nabi  

    Abstract:   
 Conducting valid statistical analyses is challenging in the presence of missing-not-at-random (MNAR) data, where the missingness mechanism is dependent on the missing values themselves even conditioned on the observed data. Here, we consider a MNAR model that generalizes several prior popular MNAR models in two ways: first, it is less restrictive in terms of statistical independence assumptions imposed on the underlying joint data distribution, and second, it allows for all variables in the observed sample to have missing values. This MNAR model corresponds to a so-called criss-cross structure considered in the literature on graphical models of missing data that prevents nonparametric identification of the entire missing data model. Nonetheless, part of the complete-data distribution remains nonparametrically identifiable. By exploiting this fact and considering a rich class of exponential family distributions, we establish sufficient conditions for identification of the complete-data distribution as well as the entire missingness mechanism. We then propose methods for testing the independence restrictions encoded in such models using odds ratio as our parameter of interest. We adopt two semiparametric approaches for estimating the odds ratio parameter and establish the corresponding asymptotic theories: one involves maximizing a conditional likelihood with order statistics and the other uses estimating equations. The utility of our methods is illustrated via simulation studies. 
 ID: 579 | Optimistic Thompson Sampling-based Algorithms for Episodic Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Bingshan Hu, Tianyue H. Zhang, Nidhi Hegde, Mark Schmidt  
   
    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 We propose two Thompson Sampling-like, model-based learning algorithms for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a finite time horizon. Our proposed algorithms are inspired by Optimistic Thompson Sampling (O-TS) previously empirically studied in Chapelle and Li [2011], May et al. [2012] for stochastic multi-armed bandits. The key idea for the original O-TS is to clip the posterior distribution in an optimistic way. Both of our proposed algorithms are easy to implement and only need one posterior sample to construct an episode-dependent model. Our first algorithm, Optimistic Thompson Sampling for MDPs (O-TS-MDP), achieves a $\widetilde{O} \left(\sqrt{AS^2H^4T} \right)$ regret bound, where $S$ is the size of the state space, $A$ is the size of the action space, $H$ is the number of time-steps per episode and $T$ is the number of episodes. Our second algorithm, Optimistic Thompson Sampling plus for MDPs (O-TS-MDP$^+$), achieves the (near)-optimal $\widetilde{O} \left(\sqrt{ASH^3T} \right)$ regret bound by taking a more aggressive clipping strategy. Since O-TS was only empirically studied before, we derive regret bounds of O-TS for stochastic bandits. In addition, we propose, O-TS-Bandit$^+$, for stochastic bandits. Both O-TS and O-TS-Bandit$^+$ achieve the optimal $O\left(\frac{A\ln(T)}{\Delta} \right)$ problem-dependent regret bound, where $\Delta$ denotes the sub-optimality gap. 
 ID: 580 | Short-term Temporal Dependency Detection under Heterogeneous Event Dynamic with Hawkes Processes   
  
 Yu Chen, Fengpei Li, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Asohan Amarasingham, Henry Lam  

    Abstract:   
 Many \textit{event sequence} data exhibit mutually exciting or inhibiting patterns. Reliable detection of such temporal dependency is crucial for scientific investigation. The \textit{de facto} model is the Multivariate Hawkes Process (MHP), whose impact function naturally encodes a causal structure in Granger causality. However, the vast majority of existing methods use direct or nonlinear transform of \textit{standard} MHP intensity with constant baseline, inconsistent with real-world data. Under irregular and unknown heterogeneous intensity, capturing temporal dependency is hard as one struggles to distinguish the effect of mutual interaction from that of intensity fluctuation. In this paper, we address the short-term temporal dependency detection issue. We show the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for cross-impact from MHP has an error that can not be eliminated but may be reduced by order of magnitude, using heterogeneous intensity not of the target HP but of the interacting HP. Then we proposed a robust and computationally-efficient method modified from MLE that does not rely on the prior estimation of the heterogeneous intensity and is thus applicable in a data-limited regime (e.g., few-shot, no repeated observations). Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method outperforms existing ones by notable margins, with highlighted novel applications in neuroscience. 
 ID: 583 | Content Sharing Design for Social Welfare in Networked Disclosure Game   
  
 Feiran Jia, Chenxi Qiu, Sarah Rajtmajer, Anna Squicciarini  

    Abstract:   
 This work models the costs and benefits of personal information sharing, or self-disclosure, in online social networks as a networked disclosure game. In a networked population where edges represent visibility amongst users, we assume a leader can influence network structure through content promotion, and we seek to optimize social welfare through network design. Our approach considers user interaction non-homogeneously, where pairwise engagement amongst users can involve or not involve sharing personal information. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. As a solution, we develop a Mixed-integer Linear Programming algorithm by linearization, which can achieve an exact solution, and also develop a time-efficient heuristic algorithm that can be used at scale. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the properties of the algorithms and map theoretical results to a dataset of posts and comments in 2020 and 2021 in a COVID-related Subreddit community where privacy risks and sharing tradeoffs were particularly pronounced.

 Sunrit Chakraborty, Aritra Guha, Rayleigh Lei, XuanLong Nguyen  

  TL;DR:  Proposed a Bayesian nonparametric model to extract interpretable patterns from complex spatio-temporal data and proposed a scalable inference algorithm to analyze large volume of data, which we demonstrate on the NGSIM traffic dataset.   Abstract:   
 Learning and understanding heterogeneous patterns in complex spatio-temporal data is an important and challenging task across domains in science and engineering. In this work we develop a model for learning heterogeneous and dynamic patterns of velocity field data, motivated by applications in the transportation domain. We draw from basic nonparametric Bayesian modeling elements such as infinite hidden Markov model and Gaussian process, and focus on making the learning of such a stochastic model scalable for voluminous and streaming data. This is achieved by employing sequential MAP estimates from the infinite HMM model, an efficient sequential sparse GP posterior computation and refinement of the estimates using Viterbi algorithm, which is shown to work effectively on a careful simulation study. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques to the NGSIM dataset of complex multi-vehicle interactions.

  TL;DR:  We propose a curriculum reinforcement learning approach, for long-horizon planning tasks, guided via reward machines that encode the non-Markovian reward function of the environment.   Abstract:   
 Self-paced reinforcement learning (RL) aims to improve the data efficiency of learning by automatically creating sequences, namely curricula, of probability distributions over contexts. However, existing techniques for self-paced RL fail in long-horizon planning tasks that involve temporally extended behaviors. We hypothesize that taking advantage of prior knowledge about the underlying task structure can improve the effectiveness of self-paced RL. We develop a self-paced RL algorithm guided by reward machines, i.e., a type of finite-state machine that encodes the underlying task structure. The algorithm integrates reward machines in 1) the update of the policy and value functions obtained by any RL algorithm of choice, and 2) the update of the automated curriculum that generates context distributions. Our empirical results evidence that the proposed algorithm achieves optimal behavior reliably even in cases in which existing baselines cannot make any meaningful progress. It also decreases the curriculum length and reduces the variance in the curriculum generation process by up to one-fourth and four orders of magnitude, respectively.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  This paper applies copulas to model unobserved dependencies between times of event and censorship in survival analysis, reducing bias in learned survival curves.   Abstract:   
 Survival datasets describe a set of instances (e.g., patients), and provide, for each, either the time until an event (e.g., death), or the censoring time (e.g., when lost to follow-up ‚Äì which is a lower bound on the time until the event). We consider the challenge of survival prediction: learning, from such data, a predictive model that can produce an individual survival distribution for a novel instance. Many contemporary methods of survival prediction implicitly assume that the event and censoring distributions are independent conditional on the instance‚Äôs covariates ‚Äì a strong assumption that is difficult to verify (as we observe only one outcome for each instance) and which can induce significant bias when it does not hold. This paper presents a parametric model of survival that extends modern non-linear survival analysis by relaxing the assumption of conditional independence. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrate that our approach significantly improves estimates of survival distributions compared to the standard that assumes conditional independence in the data.

    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Crowdsourcing is an effective and efficient paradigm for obtaining labels for unlabeled corpus employing crowd workers. This work considers the budget allocation problem for a generalized setting on a graph of instances to be labeled where edges encode instance dependencies. Specifically, given a graph and a labeling budget, we propose an optimal policy to allocate the budget among the instances to maximize the overall labeling accuracy. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian Markov Decision Process (MDP), where we define our task as an optimization problem that maximizes the overall label accuracy under budget constraints. Then, we propose a novel stage-wise reward function that considers the effect of worker labels on the whole graph at each timestamp. This reward function is utilized to find an optimal policy for the optimization problem. Theoretically, we show that our proposed policies are consistent when the budget is infinite. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world graph datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policies to achieve a higher label accuracy under budget constraints. 
 ID: 594 | Risk-limiting Financial Audits via Weighted Sampling without Replacement   
  
 Shubhanshu Shekhar, Ziyu Xu, Zachary Chase Lipton, Pierre Jinghong Liang, Aaditya Ramdas  

  TL;DR:  A general approach to auditing financial transactions using confidence sequences for estimating weighted means under adaptive sampling without replacement.   Abstract:   
 We introduce the notion of a risk-limiting financial auditing (RLFA): given $N$ transactions, the goal is to estimate the total misstated monetary fraction ($m^*$) to a given accuracy $\epsilon$, with confidence $1-\delta$. We do this by constructing new confidence sequences (CSs) for the weighted average of $N$ unknown values, based on samples drawn without replacement according to a (randomized) weighted sampling scheme. Using the idea of importance weighting to construct test martingales, we first develop a framework to construct CSs for arbitrary sampling strategies. Next, we develop methods to improve the quality of CSs by incorporating side information about the unknown values associated with each item. We show that when the side information is sufficiently predictive, it can directly drive the sampling. Addressing the case where the accuracy is unknown *a priori*, we introduce a method that incorporates side information via control variates. Crucially, our construction is adaptive: if the side information is highly predictive of the unknown misstated amounts, then the benefits of incorporating it are significant; but if the side information is uncorrelated, our methods learn to ignore it. Our methods recover state-of-the-art bounds for the special case when the weights are equal, which has already found applications in election auditing. The harder weighted case solves our more challenging problem of AI-assisted financial auditing. 
 ID: 595 | No-Regret Linear Bandits beyond Realizability   
  
 Chong Liu, Ming Yin, Yu-Xiang Wang  

  TL;DR:  A no-regret algorithm solves linear bandit problem without realizability.   Abstract:   
 We study linear bandits when the underlying reward function is not linear. Existing work relies on a uniform misspecification parameter $\epsilon$ that measures the sup-norm error of the best linear approximation. This results in an unavoidable linear regret whenever $\epsilon > 0$. We describe a more natural model of misspecification which only requires the approximation error at each input $x$ to be proportional to the suboptimality gap at $x$. It captures the intuition that, for optimization problems, near-optimal regions should matter more and we can tolerate larger approximation errors in suboptimal regions. Quite surprisingly, we show that the classical LinUCB algorithm --- designed for the realizable case --- is automatically robust against such gap-adjusted misspecification. It achieves a near-optimal $\sqrt{T}$ regret for problems that the best-known regret is almost linear in time horizon $T$. Technically, our proof relies on a novel self-bounding argument that bounds the part of the regret due to misspecification by the regret itself. 
 ID: 596 | Counting Background Knowledge Consistent Markov Equivalent Directed Acyclic Graphs   
  
 Vidya Sagar Sharma  

  TL;DR:  This paper gives a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to count the number of directed acyclic graphs in a Markov equivalence class under background knowledge constraint.   Abstract:   
 We study the problem of counting the number of directed acyclic graphs in a Markov equivalence class (MEC) that are consistent with background knowledge specified in the form of the directions of some additional edges in the MEC. A polynomial-time algorithm for the special case of the problem when no background knowledge constraints are specified was given by Wienöbst, Bannach, and Li≈õkiewicz (AAAI 2021), who also showed that the general case is NP-hard (in fact, #P-hard). In this paper, we show that the problem is nevertheless tractable in an interesting class of instances, by establishing that it is ``fixed-parameter tractable'': we give an algorithm that runs in time $O(k! k^2 n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the MEC and $k$ is the maximum number of nodes in any maximal clique of the MEC that participate in the specified background knowledge constraints. In particular, our algorithm run in polynomial time in the well-studied special case of MECs of bounded treewidth or bounded maximum clique size.

    [slides]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Significant progress has been made in developing identification and estimation techniques for missing data problems where modeling assumptions can be described via a directed acyclic graph. The validity of results using such techniques rely on the assumptions encoded by the graph holding true; however, verification of these assumptions has not received sufficient attention in prior work. In this paper, we provide new insights on the testable implications of three broad classes of missing data graphical models, and design goodness-of-fit tests for them. The classes of models explored are: sequential missing-at-random and missing-not-at-random models which can be used for modeling longitudinal studies with dropout/censoring, and a no self-censoring model which can be applied to cross-sectional studies and surveys. 
 ID: 598 | Conditionally Optimistic Exploration for Cooperative Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning   
  
 Xutong Zhao, Yangchen Pan, Chenjun Xiao, Sarath Chandar, Janarthanan Rajendran  

  TL;DR:  We introduce a conditional optimism-based exploration method for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.   Abstract:   
 Efficient exploration is critical in cooperative deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we propose an exploration method that efficiently encourages cooperative exploration based on the idea of the theoretically justified tree search algorithm UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees). The high-level intuition is that to perform optimism-based exploration, agents would achieve cooperative strategies if each agent's optimism estimate captures a structured dependency relationship with other agents. At each node (i.e., action) of the search tree, UCT performs optimism-based exploration using a bonus derived by conditioning on the visitation count of its parent node. We provide a perspective to view MARL as tree search iterations and develop a method called Conditionally Optimistic Exploration (COE). We assume agents take actions following a sequential order, and consider nodes at the same depth of the search tree as actions of one individual agent. COE computes each agent's state-action value estimate with an optimistic bonus derived from the visitation count of the state and joint actions taken by agents up to the current agent. COE is adaptable to any value decomposition method for centralized training with decentralized execution. Experiments across various cooperative MARL benchmarks show that COE outperforms current state-of-the-art exploration methods on hard-exploration tasks. 
 ID: 601 | Robust Distillation for Worst-class Performance: On the Interplay Between Teacher and Student Objectives   
  
 Serena Lutong Wang, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Yichen Zhou, Sara Hooker, Michal Lukasik, Aditya Krishna Menon  

  TL;DR:  We explore the interplay between robust optimization objectives for the teacher and student in a knowledge distillation setting.   Abstract:   
 Knowledge distillation is a popular technique that has been shown to produce remarkable gains in average accuracy. However, recent work has shown that these gains are not uniform across subgroups in the data, and can often come at the cost of accuracy on rare subgroups and classes. Robust optimization is a common remedy to improve worst-class accuracy in standard learning settings, but in distillation it is unknown whether it is best to apply robust objectives when training the teacher, the student, or both. This work studies the interplay between robust objectives for the teacher and student. Empirically, we show that that jointly modifying the teacher and student objectives can lead to better worst-class student performance and even Pareto improvement in the tradeoff between worst-class and overall performance. Theoretically, we show that the *per-class calibration* of teacher scores is key when training a robust student. Both the theory and experiments support the surprising finding that applying a robust teacher training objective does not always yield a more robust student.

 Jinyan Su, Changhong Zhao, Di Wang  

  TL;DR:  We revisit the problem of Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization (DP-SCO) in Euclidean and general $\ell_p^d$ spaces.   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we revisit the problem of Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization (DP-SCO) in Euclidean and general $\ell_p^d$ spaces. Specifically, we focus on three settings that are still far from well understood: (1) DP-SCO over a constrained and bounded (convex) set in Euclidean space; (2) unconstrained DP-SCO in $\ell_p^d$ space; (3) DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data over a constrained and bounded set in $\ell_p^d$ space. For problem (1), for both convex and strongly convex loss functions, we propose methods whose outputs could achieve (expected) excess population risks that are only dependent on the Gaussian width of the constraint set, rather than the dimension of the space. Moreover, we also show the bound for strongly convex functions is optimal up to a logarithmic factor. For problems (2) and (3), we propose several novel algorithms and provide the first theoretical results for both cases when $1

 KISHALAY DAS, Pawan Goyal, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Niloy Ganguly  

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we propose a simple multi-modal framework for crystalline materials, which fuse both graph structural and textual representation together to improve property prediction accuracy.   Abstract:   
 Machine Learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate prediction of different crystalline properties. Exiting state-of-the-art models rely on a single modality of crystal data i.e crystal graph structure, where they construct multi-graph by establishing edges between nearby atoms in 3D space and apply GNN to learn materials representation. Thereby, they encode local chemical semantics around the atoms successfully but fail to capture important global periodic structural information like space group number, crystal symmetry, rotational information etc, which influence different crystal properties. In this work, we leverage textual descriptions of materials to model global structural information into graph structure to learn a more robust and enriched representation of crystalline materials. To this effect, we first curate a textual dataset for crystalline material databases containing descriptions of each material. Further, we propose CrysMMNet, a simple multi- modal framework, which fuses both structural and textual representation together to generate a joint multimodal representation of crystalline materials. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across ten different properties to show that CrysMMNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods with a good margin. We also observe fusing textual representation with crystal graph structure provides consistent improvement for all the SOTA GNN models compared to their own vanilla version. We are going to share the textual dataset, that we have curated for both the benchmark material databases with the community for future use. 
 ID: 606 | Graph Self-supervised Learning via Proximity Divergence Minimization   
  
 Tianyi Zhang, Zhenwei DAI, Zhaozhuo Xu, Anshumali Shrivastava  

    Abstract:   
 Self-supervised learning (SSL) for graphs is an essential problem since graph data are ubiquitous and labeling can be costly. We argue that existing SSL approaches for graphs have two limitations. First, they rely on corruption techniques such as node attribute perturbation and edge dropping to generate graph views for contrastive learning. These unnatural corruption techniques require extensive tuning efforts and provide marginal improvements. Second, the current approaches require the computation of multiple graph views, which is memory and computationally inefficient. These shortcomings of graph SSL call for a corruption-free single-view learning approach, but the strawman approach of using neighboring nodes as positive examples suffers two problems: it ignores the strength of connections between nodes implied by the graph structure on a macro level, and cannot deal with the high noise in real-world graphs. We propose Proximity Divergence Minimization (PDM), a corruption-free single-view graph SSL approach that overcomes these problems by leveraging node proximity to measure connection strength and denoise the graph structure. Through extensive experiments, we show that PDM achieves up to $4.55\%$ absolute improvement in ROC-AUC on graph SSL tasks over state-of-the-art approaches while being more memory efficient. Moreover, PDM even outperforms supervised training on node classification tasks of ogbn-proteins dataset. 
 ID: 607 | TCE: A Test-Based Approach to Measuring Calibration Error   
  
 Takuo Matsubara, Niek Tax, Richard Mudd, Ido Guy  

  TL;DR:  We propose a new calibration error metric that is interpretable and stable under class imbalance. In addition, we address an optimal criterion of binning in calibration.   Abstract:   
 This paper proposes a new metric to measure the calibration error of probabilistic binary classifiers, called the test-based calibration error (TCE). TCE incorporates a novel loss function based on a statistical test to examine the extent to which model predictions differ from probabilities estimated from data. It offers (i) a clear interpretation, (ii) a consistent scale that is unaffected by class imbalance, and (iii) an enhanced visual representation alternative to the standard reliability diagram. In addition, we introduce an optimality criterion for the binning procedure of calibration error metrics based on a minimal estimation error of the empirical probabilities. We provide a new computational algorithm for optimal bins under bin-size constraints. We demonstrate properties of TCE through a range of experiments, including multiple real-world imbalanced datasets and ImageNet 1000. 
 ID: 608 | Overcoming Language Priors for Visual Question Answering via Loss Rebalancing Label and Global Context   
  
 Runlin Cao, Zhixin Li  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel training strategy called Loss Rebalancing Label and Global Context (LRLGC) to mitigate language priors in visual question answering.   Abstract:   
 Despite the advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA), many VQA models currently suffer from language priors (i.e. generating answers directly from questions without using images), which severely reduces their robustness in real-world scenarios. We propose a novel training strategy called Loss Rebalancing Label and Global Context (LRLGC) to alleviate the above problem. Specifically, the Loss Rebalancing Label (LRL) is dynamically constructed based on the degree of sample bias to accurately adjust losses across samples and ensure a more balanced form of total losses in VQA. In addition, the Global Context (GC) provides the model with valid global information to assist the model in predicting answers more accurately. Finally, the model is trained through an ensemble-based approach that retains the beneficial effects of biased samples on the model while reducing their importance. Our approach is model-agnostic and enables end-to-end training. Extensive experimental results show that LRLGC (1) improves performance for various VQA models and (2) performs competitively in the VQA-CP v2 benchmark test. 
 ID: 611 | Bayesian Inference Approach for Entropy Regularized Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Dynamics   
 [spotlight]  
 Argenis Arriojas, Jacob Adamczyk, Stas Tiomkin, Rahul V Kulkarni  

    Abstract:   
 We develop a novel approach to determine the optimal policy in entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) with stochastic dynamics. For deterministic dynamics, the optimal policy can be derived using Bayesian inference in the control-as-inference framework; however, for stochastic dynamics, the direct use of this approach leads to risk-taking optimistic policies. To address this issue, current approaches in entropy-regularized RL involve a constrained optimization procedure which fixes system dynamics to the original dynamics, however this approach is not consistent with the unconstrained Bayesian inference framework. In this work we resolve this inconsistency by developing an exact mapping from the constrained optimization problem in entropy-regularized RL to a different optimization problem which can be solved using the unconstrained Bayesian inference approach. We show that the optimal policies are the same for both problems, thus our results lead to the exact solution for the optimal policy in entropy-regularized RL with stochastic dynamics through Bayesian inference.

 [spotlight]  
 Ilia Sucholutsky, Ruairidh McLennan Battleday, Katherine M. Collins, Raja Marjieh, Joshua Peterson, Pulkit Singh, Umang Bhatt, Nori Jacoby, Adrian Weller, Thomas L. Griffiths  

  TL;DR:  We propose a framework that enables comparison of supervision signals to help users optimize data annotation for supervised learning.   Abstract:   
 Supervised learning typically focuses on learning transferable representations from training examples annotated by humans. While rich annotations (like soft labels) carry more information than sparse annotations (like hard labels), they are also more expensive to collect. We use information theory to compare how a number of commonly used supervision signals contribute to representation-learning performance, as well as how their capacity is affected by factors such as the number of labels, classes, dimensions, and noise. Our framework provides theoretical justification for using hard labels in the big-data regime, but richer supervision signals for few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization. We validate these results empirically in a series of experiments with over 1 million crowdsourced image annotations and conduct a cost-benefit analysis to establish a tradeoff curve that enables users to optimize the cost of supervising representation learning on their own datasets.

  TL;DR:  We study the design of caching policies in applications such as serverless computing where there is not a fixed size cache to be filled , but rather there is a cost associated with the time an item stays in the cache.   Abstract:   
 We study the design of caching policies in applications such as serverless computing where there is not a fixed size cache to be filled, but rather there is a cost associated with the time an item stays in the cache. We present a model for such caching policies which captures the trade-off between this cost and the cost of cache misses. We characterize optimal caching policies in general and apply this characterization by deriving a closed form for Hawkes processes. Since optimal policies for Hawkes processes depend on the history of arrivals, we also develop history-independent policies which achieve near-optimal average performance. We evaluate the performances of the optimal policy and approximate polices using simulations and a data trace of Azure Functions, Microsoft's FaaS (Function as a Service) platform for serverless computing.

    [slides]   
   
  TL;DR:  We connect calibration in regression and classification with the notion of parity (whether the next observation increases or decreases w.r.t. the current observation), and propose methods to produce parity calibrated predictions.   Abstract:   
 In a sequential prediction setting, a decision-maker may be primarily concerned with whether the continuous-valued future observation will increase or decrease compared to the current one, rather than the actual value of the future observation. We introduce the parity calibration framework, where the goal is to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates for the increase-decrease event in a timeseries. While these ``parity" probabilities can be extracted from a distributional forecast, such a strategy does not work as expected and can have poor practical performance. We then observe that although the original task was regression, parity calibration can be expressed as binary calibration. Drawing on this connection, we use a recently proposed online binary calibration method to achieve parity calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on real-world case studies in epidemiology, weather forecasting, and model-based control in nuclear fusion.

  TL;DR:  We propose a sampling mechanism for annotation queries to detect failure patterns from an unlabeled dataset   Abstract:   
 Given a (machine learning) classifier and a collection of unlabeled data, how can we efficiently identify misclassification patterns presented in this dataset? To address this problem, we propose a human-machine collaborative framework that consists of a team of human annotators and a sequential recommendation algorithm. The recommendation algorithm is conceptualized as a stochastic sampler that, in each round, queries the annotators a subset of samples for their true labels and obtains the information on whether the samples are misclassified. The sampling mechanism needs to balance between discovering new patterns of misclassification (exploration) and confirming the potential patterns of classification (exploitation). We construct a determinantal point process, whose intensity balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off through the weighted update of the posterior at each round to form the generator of the stochastic sampler. The numerical results empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of our framework on multiple dataset at various signal-to-noise ratios.

  TL;DR:  Constrained learning for the problem of novel class detection under distribution shift; Guaranteed solution under relatively mild assumptions   Abstract:   
 In this work, we solve the problem of novel class detection under distribution shift. This problem is critical to ensuring the safety and efficacy of machine learning models, particularly in domains such as healthcare where timely detection of novel subgroups of patients is crucial. To address this problem, we propose a method based on constrained learning. Our approach is guaranteed to detect a novel class under a relatively weak assumption, namely that rare events in past data have bounded frequency under the shifted distribution. Prior works on the problem do not provide such guarantees, as they either attend to very specific types of distribution shift or make stringent assumptions that limit their guarantees. We demonstrate favorable performance of our method on challenging novel class detection problems over real world datasets.

 [spotlight]  
 Noah Burrell, Grant Schoenebeck  

  TL;DR:  We explore the extent to which common assumptions about the way that crowd workers make mistakes in microtask (labeling) applications manifest in real crowdsourcing data.   Abstract:   
 Do common assumptions about the way that crowd workers make mistakes in microtask (labeling) applications manifest in real crowdsourcing data? Prior work only addresses this question indirectly. Instead, it primarily focuses on designing new label aggregation algorithms, seeming to imply that better performance justifies any additional assumptions. However, empirical evidence in past instances has raised significant challenges to common assumptions. We continue this line of work, using crowdsourcing data itself as directly as possible to interrogate several basic assumptions about workers and tasks. We find strong evidence that the assumption that workers respond correctly to each task with a constant probability, which is common in theoretical work, is implausible in real data. We also illustrate how heterogeneity among tasks and workers can take different forms, which have different implications for the design and evaluation of label aggregation algorithms.

  TL;DR:  Our work uses probabilistic deep networks with statistical image models to learn informative priors for structured images allowing active learning for dense regression tasks, like super-resolution.   Abstract:   
 Dense regression is a widely used approach in computer vision for tasks such as image super-resolution, enhancement, depth estimation, etc. However, the high cost of annotation and labeling makes it challenging to achieve accurate results. We propose incorporating active learning into dense regression models to address this problem. Active learning allows models to select the most informative samples for labeling, reducing the overall annotation cost while improving performance. Despite its potential, active learning has not been widely explored in high-dimensional computer vision regression tasks like super-resolution. We address this research gap and propose a new framework called USIM-DAL that leverages the statistical properties of colour images to learn informative priors using probabilistic deep neural networks that model the heteroscedastic predictive distribution allowing uncertainty quantification. Moreover, the aleatoric uncertainty from the network serves as a proxy for error that is used for active learning. Our experiments on a wide variety of datasets spanning applications in natural images (visual genome, BSD100), medical imaging (histopathology slides), and remote sensing (satellite images) demonstrate the efficacy of the newly proposed USIM-DAL and superiority over several dense regression active learning methods.

    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 We investigate the problems of maximizing $k$-submodular functions over total size constraints and over individual size constraints. $k$-submodularity is a generalization of submodularity beyond just picking items of a ground set, instead associating one of $k$ types to chosen items. For sensor selection problems, for instance, this enables modeling of which type of sensor to put at a location, not simply whether to put a sensor or not. We propose and analyze threshold-greedy algorithms for both types of constraints. We prove that our proposed algorithms achieve the best known approximation ratios, up to a user-chosen parameter $\varepsilon>0$, for both constraint types while using only $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(nk)$ function evaluations; other algorithms that achieve the best-known deterministic approximation ratios use $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(nkB)$ function evaluations, where $B\leq n$ is the total cardinality and sum of cardinalities respectively, $n$ is the number of elements, and $k$ is the number of types, and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ suppresses logarithmic terms. We empirically demonstrate our algorithms' performance in an application of influence maximization with $k$ topics.

 Gathika Ratnayaka, Qing Wang, Yang Li  

  TL;DR:  This paper introduces a contrastive learning framework for deep graph matching.   Abstract:   
 Deep graph matching techniques have shown promising results in recent years. In this work, we cast deep graph matching as a contrastive learning task and introduce a new objective function for contrastive mapping to exploit the relationships between matches and non-matches. To this end, we develop a hardness attention mechanism to select negative samples which captures the relatedness and informativeness of positive and negative samples. Further, we propose a novel deep graph matching framework, \emph{Stable Graph Matching} (StableGM), which incorporates Sinkhorn ranking into a stable marriage algorithm to efficiently compute one-to-one node correspondences between graphs. We prove that the proposed objective function for contrastive matching is both positive and negative informative, offering theoretical guarantees to achieve dual-optimality in graph matching. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach by conducting experiments on standard graph matching benchmarks.

  TL;DR:  On the problem of recovering causal DAGs via interventions, we study the trade-off between the number of adaptive rounds used and the number of interventions required; we give matching upper and lower bounds.   Abstract:   
 Causal discovery from interventional data is an important problem, where the task is to design an interventional strategy that learns the hidden ground truth causal graph $G(V,E)$ on $|V| = n$ nodes while minimizing the number of performed interventions. Most prior interventional strategies broadly fall into two categories: non-adaptive and adaptive. Non-adaptive strategies decide on a single fixed set of interventions to be performed while adaptive strategies can decide on which nodes to intervene on sequentially based on past interventions. While adaptive algorithms may use exponentially fewer interventions than their non-adaptive counterparts, there are practical concerns that constrain the amount of adaptivity allowed. Motivated by this trade-off, we study the problem of $r$-adaptivity, where the algorithm designer recovers the causal graph under a total of $r$ sequential rounds whilst trying to minimize the total number of interventions. For this problem, we provide a $r$-adaptive algorithm that achieves $O(\min\{r,\log n\} \cdot n^{1/\min\{r,\log n\}})$ approximation with respect to the verification number, a well-known lower bound for adaptive algorithms. Furthermore, for every $r$, we show that our approximation is tight. Our definition of $r$-adaptivity interpolates nicely between the non-adaptive ($r=1$) and fully adaptive ($r=n$) settings where our approximation simplifies to $O(n)$ and $O(\log n)$ respectively, matching the best-known approximation guarantees for both extremes. Our results also extend naturally to the bounded size interventions.

  TL;DR:  Top down inspired end to end method for hierarchically coherent probabilistic forecasting   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic, hierarchically coherent forecasting is a key problem in many practical forecasting applications -- the goal is to obtain coherent probabilistic predictions for a large number of time series arranged in a pre-specified tree hierarchy. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep probabilistic model for hierarchical forecasting that is motivated by a classical top-down strategy. It jointly learns the distribution of the root time series, and the (dirichlet) proportions according to which each parent time-series is split among its children at any point in time. The resulting forecasts are naturally coherent, and provide probabilistic predictions over all time series in the hierarchy. We experiment on several public datasets and demonstrate significant improvements of up to 26% on most datasets compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we also provide theoretical justification for the superiority of our top-down approach compared to the more traditional bottom-up modeling.

  TL;DR:  We are proposing a method (FLASH), which solves the CASH problem for an FL setting in a decentralized way and do not need any FL training in the solution of CASH   Abstract:   
 In this paper, we present FLASH, a framework which addresses for the first time the central AutoML problem of Combined Algorithm Selection and HyperParameter (HP) Optimization (CASH) in the context of Federated Learning (FL). To limit training cost, FLASH incrementally adapts the set of algorithms to train based on their projected loss rates, while supporting decentralized (federated) implementation of the embedded hyperparameter optimization (HPO), model selection and loss calculation problems. We provide a theoretical analysis of the training and validation loss under FLASH, and their tradeoff with the training cost measured as the data wasted in training sub-optimal algorithms. The bounds depend on the degree of dissimilarity between the datasets of the clients, a result of FL restriction that client datasets remain private. Through extensive experimental investigation on several datasets, we evaluate three variants of FLASH, and show that FLASH performs close to centralized CASH methods.

 Vignesh Ram Somnath, Matteo Pariset, Ya-Ping Hsieh, Maria Rodriguez Martinez, Andreas Krause, Charlotte Bunne  

    Abstract:   
 Diffusion Schrödinger Bridges (DSBs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for recovering stochastic dynamics via their marginal observations at different time points. Despite numerous successful applications, existing algorithms for solving DSBs have so far failed to utilize the structure of aligned data, which naturally arises in many biological phenomena. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework that, for the first time, solves DSBs while respecting the data alignment. Our approach hinges on a combination of two decades-old ideas: The classical Schrödinger bridge theory and Doob's $h$-transform. Compared to prior methods, our approach leads to a simpler training procedure with lower variance, which we further augment with principled regularization schemes. This ultimately leads to sizeable improvements across experiments on synthetic and real data, including the tasks of rigid protein docking and temporal evolution of cellular differentiation processes.

  TL;DR:  We propose to use latent space energy-based model to capture the joint distribution of molecules and their properties and optimize molecule properties by sampling with gradual distribution shifting.   Abstract:   
 Generation of molecules with desired chemical and biological properties such as high drug-likeness, high binding affinity to target proteins, is critical for drug discovery. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model to capture the joint distribution of molecules and their properties. Our model assumes an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space. Conditional on the latent vector, the molecule and its properties are modeled by a molecule generation model and a property regression model respectively. To search for molecules with desired properties, we propose a sampling with gradual distribution shifting (SGDS) algorithm, so that after learning the model initially on the training data of existing molecules and their properties, the proposed algorithm gradually shifts the model distribution towards the region supported by molecules with desired values of properties. Our experiments show that our method achieves competitive performances on various molecule design tasks.

 Ziyu Wang, Binjie Yuan, Jiaxun Lu, Bowen Ding, yunfeng shao, Qibin Wu, Jun Zhu  

    Abstract:   
 Consider the problem of out-of-distribution prediction given data from multiple environments. While a sufficiently diverse collection of training environments will facilitate the identification of an invariant predictor, with an optimal generalization performance, many applications only provide us with a limited number of environments. It is thus necessary to consider adapting to distribution shift using a handful of labeled test samples. We propose a constrained Bayesian approach for this task, which restricts to models with a worst-group training loss above a prespecified threshold. Our method avoids a pathology of the standard Bayesian posterior, which occurs when spurious correlations improve in-distribution prediction. We also show that on certain high-dimensional linear problems, constrained modeling improves the sample efficiency of adaptation. Synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the robust performance of our approach.

    Abstract:   
 Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and Nesterov's Accelerated Stochastic Gradient (ASG) are popular momentum methods in optimization. While the benefits of these acceleration ideas in deterministic settings are well understood, their advantages in stochastic optimization are unclear. Several works have recently claimed that SHB and ASG always help in stochastic optimization. Our work shows that i.) these claims are either flawed or one-sided (e.g., consider only the bias term but not the variance), and ii.) when both these terms are accounted for, SHB and ASG do not always help. Specifically, for \textit{any} quadratic optimization, we obtain a lower bound on the sample complexity of SHB and ASG, accounting for both bias and variance, and show that the vanilla SGD can achieve the same bound.

  TL;DR:  This paper shows that bidirectional attention is equivalent to continuous bag of words with mixture-of-experts weights, and builds on this equivalence to argue about linear structures on the embeddings and give extensions to sequence and tabular data   Abstract:   
 Bidirectional attention has emerged as a key component of modern large language models, which includes self-attention mechanism, position encodings, and the MLM objective. Despite its widespread use, few studies have examined the inductive bias underlying bidirectional attention: What sets bidirectional attention models apart from its non-attention predecessors like CBOW? Are they completely different model classes? In this paper, we show that, upon reparameterization, bidirectional attention---namely training single-head single-layer attention with position encodings using the MLM objective---is equivalent to CBOW with mixture-of-experts weights, hence bidirectional attention as mixture of continuous word experts. This viewpoint enables us to characterize when embeddings from bidirectional attention exhibit a similar linear structure to its non-attention predecessors (e.g., word2vec, GloVe). It also suggests immediate extensions of bidirectional attention beyond text, including general non-textual sequence data and tabular data. Empirically, we demonstrate the attention-based approach to tabular data improves out-of-distribution generalization.

    Abstract:   
 We consider the so-called \emph{Independent Cascade Model} for rumor spreading or epidemic processes popularized by Kempe et al.\ (2003). In this model, a node of a network is the source of a rumor -- it is \emph{informed}. In discrete time steps, each informed node ``infects'' each of its uninformed neighbors with probability $p$. While many facets of this process are studied in the literature, less is known about the inference problem: given a number of infected nodes in a network, can we learn the source of the rumor? In the context of epidemiology this problem is often referred to as \emph{patient zero problem}. It belongs to a broader class of problems where the goal is to infer parameters of the underlying spreading model. In this work we present a maximum likelihood estimator for the rumor's source, given a snapshot of the process in terms of a set of active nodes $X$ after $t$ steps. Our results show that, for acyclic graphs, the likelihood estimator undergoes a phase transition as a function of $t$. We provide a rigorous analysis for two prominent classes of acyclic network, namely $d$-regular trees and Galton-Watson trees, and verify empirically that our heuristics work well in various general networks.

    Abstract:   
 We propose policy gradient algorithms for solving a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning problem in on-policy as well as off-policy settings. We consider episodic Markov decision processes and model the risk using the broad class of smooth risk measures of the cumulative discounted reward. We propose two template policy gradient algorithms that optimize a smooth risk measure in on-policy and off-policy RL settings, respectively. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that quantify the rate of convergence to our proposed algorithms to a stationary point of the smooth risk measure. As special cases, we establish that our algorithms apply to the optimization of mean-variance and distortion risk measures, respectively. 
 ID: 679 | Interpretable Differencing of Machine Learning Models   
  
 Swagatam Haldar, Diptikalyan Saha, Dennis Wei, Rahul Nair, Elizabeth M. Daly  

  TL;DR:  We provide a framework to understand the similarities and differences between two models trained for the same task in an interpretable fashion.   Abstract:   
 Understanding the differences between machine learning (ML) models is of interest in scenarios ranging from choosing amongst a set of competing models, to updating a deployed model with new training data. In these cases, we wish to go beyond differences in overall metrics such as accuracy to identify where in the feature space do the differences occur. We formalize this problem of model differencing as one of predicting a dissimilarity function of two ML models‚Äô outputs, subject to the representation of the differences being human-interpretable. Our solution is to learn a Joint Surrogate Tree (JST), which is composed of two conjoined decision tree surrogates for the two models. A JST provides an intuitive representation of differences and places the changes in the context of the models‚Äô decision logic. Context is important as it helps users to map differences to an underlying mental model of an AI system. We also propose a refinement procedure to increase the precision of a JST. We demonstrate, through an empirical evaluation, that such contextual differencing is concise and can be achieved with no loss in fidelity over naive approaches.

    Abstract:   
 Off-policy methods are the basis of a large number of effective Policy Optimization (PO) algorithms. In this setting, Importance Sampling (IS) is typically employed as a what-if analysis tool, with the goal of estimating the performance of a target policy, given samples collected with a different behavioral policy. However, in Monte Carlo simulation, IS represents a variance minimization approach. In this field, a suitable behavioral distribution is employed for sampling, allowing diminishing the variance of the estimator below the one achievable when sampling from the target distribution. In this paper, we analyze IS in these two guises in the context of PO. We provide a novel view of off-policy PO, showing a connection between the policy improvement and variance minimization objectives. Then, we illustrate how minimizing the off-policy variance can, in some circumstances, lead to a policy improvement, with the advantage, compared with direct off-policy learning, of implicitly enforcing a trust region. Finally, we present numerical simulations on continuous RL benchmarks, with a particular focus on the robustness to small batch sizes. 
 ID: 695 | On the Role of Generalization in Transferability of Adversarial Examples   
  
 Yilin Wang, Farzan Farnia  

    Abstract:   
 Black-box adversarial attacks designing adversarial examples for unseen deep neural networks (DNNs) have received great attention over the past years. However, the underlying factors driving the transferability of black-box adversarial examples still lack a thorough understanding. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate the role of the generalization behavior of the substitute classifier used for generating adversarial examples in the transferability of the attack scheme to unobserved DNN classifiers. To do this, we apply the max-min adversarial example game framework and show the importance of the generalization properties of the substitute DNN from training to test data in the success of the black-box attack scheme in application to different DNN classifiers. We prove theoretical generalization bounds on the difference between the attack transferability rates on training and test samples. Our bounds suggest that operator norm-based regularization methods could improve the transferability of the designed adversarial examples. We support our theoretical results by performing several numerical experiments showing the role of the substitute network's generalization in generating transferable adversarial examples. Our empirical results indicate the power of Lipschitz regularization and early stopping methods in improving the transferability of designed adversarial examples. 
 ID: 696 | Greed is good: correspondence recovery for unlabeled linear regression   
  
 Hang Zhang, Ping Li  

    Abstract:   
 We consider the unlabeled linear regression reading as $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{\Pi}^{*}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{B}^* + \mathbf{W}$, where $\mathbf{\Pi}^{*}, \mathbf{B}^*$ and $\mathbf{W}$ represents missing (or incomplete) correspondence information, signals, and additive noise, respectively. Our goal is to perform data alignment between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$, or equivalently, reconstruct the correspondence information encoded by $\mathbf{\Pi}^*$. Based on whether signal $\mathbf{B}^*$ is given a prior, we separately propose two greedy-selection based estimators, which both reach the mini-max optimality. Compared with previous works, our work $(i)$ supports partial recovery of the correspondence information; and $(ii)$ applies to a general matrix family rather than the permutation matrices, to put more specifically, selection matrices, where multiple rows of $\mathbf{X}$ can correspond to the same row in $\mathbf{Y}$. Moreover, numerical experiments are provided to corroborate our claims.

    Abstract:   
 In many real-world problems, the learning agent needs to learn a problem‚Äôs abstractions and solution simultaneously. However, most such abstractions need to be designed and refined by hand for different problems and domains of application. This paper presents a novel top-down approach for constructing state abstractions while carrying out reinforcement learning (RL). Starting with state variables and a simulator, it presents a novel domain-independent approach for dynamically computing an abstraction based on the dispersion of Q-values in abstract states as the agent continues acting and learning. Extensive empirical evaluation on multiple domains and problems shows that this approach automatically learns abstractions that are finely-tuned to the problem, yield powerful sample efficiency, and result in the RL agent significantly outperforming existing approaches. 
 ID: 704 | Time-Conditioned Generative Modeling of Object-Centric Representations for Video Decomposition and Prediction   
  
 Chengmin Gao, Bin Li  

    Abstract:   
 When perceiving the world from multiple viewpoints, humans have the ability to reason about the complete objects in a compositional manner even when the object is completely occluded from partial viewpoints. Meanwhile, humans can imagine the novel views after observing multiple viewpoints. The remarkable recent advance in multiview object-centric learning leaves some problems: 1) the partially or completely occluded shape of objects can not be well reconstructed. 2) the novel viewpoint prediction depends on expensive viewpoint annotations rather than implicit view rules. This makes the agent fail to perform like humans. In this paper, we introduce a time-conditioned generative model for videos. To reconstruct the complete shape of the object accurately, we enhance the disentanglement between different latent representations: view latent representations are jointly inferred based on the Transformer and then cooperate with the sequential extension of Slot Attention to learn object-centric representations. The model also achieves the new ability: Gaussian processes are employed as priors of view latent variables for generation and novel-view prediction without viewpoint annotations. Experiments on multiple specifically designed synthetic datasets have shown that the proposed model can 1) make the video decomposition, 2) reconstruct the complete shapes of objects, and 3) make the novel viewpoint prediction without viewpoint annotations. 
 ID: 707 | Phase-shifted Adversarial Training   
 [spotlight]  
 Yeachan Kim, Seongyeon Kim, Ihyeok Seo, Bonggun Shin  

  TL;DR:  we present a novel approach to adversarial training, coined phase-shifted adversarial training, to learn the adversarial examples in an efficient manner.   Abstract:   
 While adversarial training (AT) has been considered an imperative component for safely deploying neural network-based applications, it comes with slow convergence and worse performance on clean samples. In this work, we analyze the behavior of neural networks when learning with adversarial samples through the lens of response frequency. Interestingly, we empirically observe that AT causes neural networks to have slow convergence to high-frequency information, resulting in highly oscillated predictions near each data. To learn high-frequency contents efficiently, we first prove that a universal phenomenon of frequency principle, i.e., \textit{lower frequencies are learned first}, still holds in AT. Built upon such theoretical ground, we present a novel approach to adversarial training, coined phase-shifted adversarial training (PhaseAT). In PhaseAT, the high-frequency components, which are susceptible factor for slow convergence, are adaptively shifted into the low-frequency range where the fast convergence occurs. For evaluations, we conduct the extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with the adaptive attack carefully designed for reliable evaluation. Comprehensive results show that PhaseAT substantially improves the convergence for high-frequency information, thereby leading to the improved adversarial robustness in an efficient manner with better accuracy on clean samples. 
 ID: 713 | Regularized Online DR-Submodular Optimization   
  
 Pengyu Zuo, Yao Wang, Shaojie Tang  

  TL;DR:  This paper proposes a regularized online optimization problem with concave and DR-submodular regularizers, and presents efficient algorithms for both cases with theoretical performance guarantees.   Abstract:   
 The utilization of online optimization techniques is prevalent in many fields of artificial intelligence, enabling systems to continuously learn and adjust to their surroundings. This paper outlines a regularized online optimization problem, where the regularizer is defined on the average of the actions taken. The objective is to maximize the sum of rewards and the regularizer value while adhering to resource constraints, where the reward function is assumed to be DR-submodular. Both concave and DR-submodular regularizers are analyzed. Concave functions are useful in describing the impartiality of decisions, while DR-submodular functions can be employed to represent the overall effect of decisions on all relevant parties. We have developed two algorithms for each of the concave and DR-submodular regularizers. These algorithms are easy to implement, efficient, and produce sublinear regret in both cases. The performance of the proposed algorithms and regularizers has been verified through numerical experiments in the context of internet advertising. 
 ID: 722 | Mitigating Transformer Overconfidence via Lipschitz Regularization   
  
 Wenqian Ye, Yunsheng Ma, Xu Cao, Kun Tang  

    Abstract:   
 Though Transformers have achieved promising results in many computer vision tasks, they tend to be over-confident in predictions, as the standard Dot Product Self-Attention (DPSA) can barely preserve distance for the unbounded input domain. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a novel Lipschitz Regularized Transformer (LRFormer). Specifically, we present a new similarity function with the distance within Banach Space to ensure the Lipschitzness and also regularize the term by a contractive Lipschitz Bound. The proposed method is analyzed with a theoretical guarantee, providing a rigorous basis for its effectiveness and reliability. Extensive experiments conducted on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art single forward pass approaches in prediction, calibration, and uncertainty estimation.

    [link to video]   
   
  TL;DR:  We propose a risk-aware curriculum generation algorithm that, given a heavy-tailed distribution over target tasks, generates two curricula: one to maximize the expected discounted return, and another to identify and over-sample rare and risky tasks.   Abstract:   
 Automated curriculum generation facilitates reinforcement learning (RL) by designing a sequence of tasks. It typically aims to optimize a distribution over tasks with exponentially bounded tails. In this setting, the agent might be underexposed to rare tasks, leading to a sub-optimal behavior. This issue is exacerbated in task distributions with heavy tails. To mitigate this issue, we propose a risk-aware curriculum generation algorithm that mixes two curricula: 1) a primary curriculum that aims to maximize the expected discounted return with respect to a distribution over target tasks, and 2) an auxiliary curriculum that identifies and over-samples rare tasks observed in the primary curriculum. Our empirical results in two domains with heavy-tailed distributions evidence that the proposed algorithm achieves higher returns in frequent as well as rare tasks compared to the state-of-the-art curriculum generation methods. 
 ID: 732 | Practical Privacy-Preserving Gaussian Process Regression via Secret Sharing   
  
 Jinglong Luo, Yehong Zhang, Jiaqi Zhang, Shuang Qin, Yue Yu, Hui Wang, Zenglin Xu  

  TL;DR:  This is the first work that considers to protect the privacy of a Gaussian process regression model via secret sharing.   Abstract:   
 Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a non-parametric model that has been used in many real-world applications that involve sensitive personal data (e.g., healthcare, finance, etc.) from multiple data owners. To fully and securely exploit the value of different data sources, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving GPR method based on secret sharing (SS), a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) technique. In contrast to existing studies that protect the data privacy of GPR via homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or federated learning, our proposed method is more practical and can be used to preserve the data privacy of both the model inputs and outputs for various data-sharing scenarios (e.g., horizontally/vertically-partitioned data). However, it is non-trivial to directly apply SS on the conventional GPR algorithm, as it includes some operations whose accuracy and/or efficiency have not been well-enhanced in the current SMPC protocol. To address this issue, we derive a new SS-based exponentiation operation through the idea of ‚Äúconfusion-correction‚Äù and constructing a privacy-preserving matrix inversion algorithm based on Cholesky decomposition. More importantly, we theoretically analyze the communication cost and the security of the proposed SS-based operations. Empirical evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that our proposed method can achieve reasonable accuracy and efficiency under the premise of preserving data privacy.

 Valentin Bieri, Paul Streli, Berken Utku Demirel, Christian Holz  

  TL;DR:  A Belief Propagation method for PPG-based heart rate estimation.   Abstract:   
 We present a novel learning-based method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several heart rate estimation benchmarks extracted from photoplethysmography signals (PPG). We consider the evolution of the heart rate in the context of a discrete-time stochastic process that we represent as a hidden Markov model. We derive a distribution over possible heart rate values for a given PPG signal window through a trained neural network. Using belief propagation, we incorporate the statistical distribution of heart rate changes to refine these estimates in a temporal context. From this, we obtain a quantized probability distribution over the range of possible heart rate values that captures a meaningful and well-calibrated estimate of the inherent predictive uncertainty. We show the robustness of our method on eight public datasets with three-different cross-validation experiments.

 [spotlight]  
 Sakshi Agarwal, Gabriel Hope, Ali Younis, Erik B. Sudderth  
   
    [link to video]   
   
    Abstract:   
 Deep generative models like variational autoencoders (VAEs) are widely used for density estimation and dimensionality reduction, but infer latent representations via amortized inference algorithms that require observations of all data dimensions. VAEs thus lack a key strength of probabilistic graphical models: the ability to infer posteriors for test queries with arbitrary structure. We demonstrate that many prior methods for imputation with VAEs are costly and ineffective, and achieve superior performance via query-adaptive variational inference (QAVI) algorithms based directly on the generative decoder. By analytically marginalizing arbitrary sets of missing features, and optimizing expressive posteriors including mixtures and density flows, our non-amortized QAVI algorithms achieve excellent performance while avoiding expensive model retraining. On standard image and tabular datasets, our approach substantially outperforms prior methods in the plausibility and diversity of imputations. We also show that QAVI effectively generalizes to recent hierarchical VAE models for high-dimensional images. 
 ID: 748 | Incentivizing honest performative predictions with proper scoring rules   
  
 Caspar Oesterheld, Johannes Treutlein, Emery Cooper, Rubi Hudson  

  TL;DR:  Oracle AI, proper scoring rules, self-fulfilling prophecy, performative prediction, AI safety   Abstract:   
 Proper scoring rules incentivize experts to accurately report beliefs, assuming predictions cannot influence outcomes. We relax this assumption and investigate incentives when predictions are performative, i.e., when they can influence the outcome of the prediction, such as when making public predictions about the stock market. We say a prediction is a fixed point if it accurately reflects the expert‚Äôs beliefs after that prediction has been made. We show that in this setting, reports maximizing expected score generally do not reflect an expert‚Äôs beliefs, and we give bounds on the inaccuracy of such reports. We show that, for binary predictions, if the influence of the expert‚Äôs prediction on outcomes is bounded, it is possible to define scoring rules under which optimal reports are arbitrarily close to fixed points. However, this is impossible for predictions over more than two outcomes. We also perform numerical simulations in a toy setting, showing that our bounds are tight in some situations and that prediction error is often substantial (greater than 5-10%). Lastly, we discuss alternative notions of optimality, including performative stability, and show that they incentivize reporting fixed points. 
 ID: 750 | Universal Graph Contrastive Learning with a Novel Laplacian Perturbation   
  
 Taewook Ko, Yoonhyuk Choi, Chong-Kwon Kim  

  TL;DR:  We introcued a novel universal graph contrastive learning by defining a Laplacian peturbation.   Abstract:   
 Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is an effective method for discovering meaningful patterns in graph data. By evaluating diverse augmentations of the graph, GCL learns discriminative representations and provides a flexible and scalable mechanism for various graph mining tasks. This paper proposes a novel contrastive learning framework based on Laplacian perturbation. The framework employs a complex Hermitian adjacency matrix which enables the application of a novel graph Laplacian. Unlike existing GCL methods, the proposed framework is not restricted to specific graph types and enjoys a wider range of applicability. We demonstrate that a spectral graph convolution based on the Laplacian extracts the representations of diverse graph types successfully. Our extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets, covering multiple graph types, show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both node classification and link sign prediction tasks.

  TL;DR:  We show formally why and when incorporating tiered background knowledge into equivalence classes of DAGs leads to considerable gains in informativeness and computational efficiency.   Abstract:   
 Equivalence classes of DAGs (represented by CPDAGs) may be too large to provide useful causal information. Here, we address incorporating tiered background knowledge yielding restricted equivalence classes represented by ‚Äòtiered MPDAGs‚Äô. Tiered knowledge leads to considerable gains in informativeness and computational efficiency: We show that construction of tiered MPDAGs only requires application of Meeks 1st rule, and that tiered MPDAGs (unlike general MPDAGs) are chain graphs with chordal components. This entails simplifications e.g. of determining valid adjustment sets for causal effect estimation. Further, we characterise when one tiered ordering is more informative than another, providing insights into useful aspects of background knowledge. 
 ID: 756 | Structure-aware robustness certificates for graph classification   
  
 Pierre Osselin, Henry Kenlay, Xiaowen Dong  

  TL;DR:  Randomized smooothing with anisotropic noise is introduced in the context of graph classification leading to more flexible robustness certificates.   Abstract:   
 Certifying the robustness of a graph-based machine learning model poses a critical challenge for safety. Current robustness certificates for graph classifiers guarantee output invariance with respect to the total number of node pair flips (edge addition or edge deletion), which amounts to an $l_{0}$ ball centred on the adjacency matrix. Although theoretically attractive, this type of isotropic structural noise can be too restrictive in practical scenarios where some node pairs are more critical than others in determining the classifier's output. The certificate, in this case, gives a pessimistic depiction of the robustness of the graph model. To tackle this issue, we develop a randomised smoothing method based on adding an anisotropic noise distribution to the input graph structure. We show that our process generates structural-aware certificates for our classifiers, whereby the magnitude of robustness certificates can vary across different pre-defined structures of the graph. We demonstrate the benefits of these certificates in both synthetic and real-world experiments. 
 ID: 757 | Scaling Integer Arithmetic in Probabilistic Programs   
  
 William Cao, Poorva Garg, Ryan Tjoa, Steven Holtzen, Todd Millstein, Guy Van den Broeck  

  TL;DR:  A binary encoding combined with knowledge compilation allows for scaled inference on integer distributions.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) allow a program to define a probabilistic model. Within the framework of a programming language, they provide the ability to declare random variables and condition on complex events. Much like traditional programming languages, where integers are perhaps the most common data type, one natural feature of PPLs is their ability to manipulate distributions over integers. Although most PPLs provide the ability to express distributions over integers, their support for inference over these distributions is limited. Most approaches essentially reduce to enumeration of all possible values, a strategy that does not scale well, or to general-purpose sampling. Our insight is that there is structure in arithmetic that these approaches are not using. We present a binary encoding strategy for random integers where binary-number bits are replaced by Boolean functions of random coin flips. This binary encoding then enables the circuit compilation approach to probabilistic inference to naturally exploit the structure behind arithmetic operations. This inference strategy scales to much larger integer distributions with arithmetic, further allowing us to support more language constructs such as parametrised flips and Beta priors, which enables Bayesian parameter learning from incomplete data.

  TL;DR:  This work presents several improvements upon existing computational protein re-design algorithm, AOBB-K*, noticeably improving scalability and leading to schemes that can be generalized to other well known tasks over graphical models.   Abstract:   
 Scientific computing has experienced a boom empowered by advancements in technologies such as neural networks. However, certain important tasks are less amenable to these technologies, benefiting from innovations to traditional inference schemes. One such task is protein re-design. Recently a new re-design algorithm, AOBB-K*, was introduced and was competitive with state-of-the art BBK* on small protein re-design problems that assume rigid backbone and rotamers. However, AOBB-K* suffered scalability issues. In this work, we address issues that limited AOBB-K* and present three new variants: AOBB-K*-b (boosted), AOBB-K*-DH (with dynamic heuristics), and AOBB-K*-UFO (with underflow optimization) that noticeably improve scalability. From their founding principles, we also present generalized schemes useful for other well known inference tasks. 
 ID: 764 | Robust Gaussian Process Regression with the Trimmed Marginal Likelihood   
 [spotlight]  
 Daniel Andrade, Akiko Takeda  

  TL;DR:  Optimizing the marginal likelihood for outlier detection with an efficient projected gradient descent method.   Abstract:   
 Accurate outlier detection is not only a necessary preprocessing step, but can itself give important insights into the data. However, especially, for non-linear regression the detection of outliers is non-trivial, and actually ambiguous. We propose a new method that identifies outliers by finding a subset of data points $T$ such that the marginal likelihood of all remaining data points $S$ is maximized. Though the idea is more general, it is particular appealing for Gaussian processes regression, where the marginal likelihood has an analytic solution. While maximizing the marginal likelihood for hyper-parameter optimization is a well established non-convex optimization problem, optimizing the set of data points $S$ is not. Indeed, even a greedy approximation for optimizing the set of data points $S$ is computationally challenging due to the high cost of evaluating the marginal likelihood. As a remedy, we propose an efficient projected gradient descent method with provable convergence guarantees. Moreover, we also establish the breakdown point when jointly optimizing hyper-parameters and $S$. For various datasets and types of outliers, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can improve outlier detection and robustness when compared with several popular alternatives, like the student-t likelihood. 
 ID: 773 | Finding Invariant Predictors Efficiently via Causal Structure   
  
 Kenneth Lee, Md Musfiqur Rahman, Murat Kocaoglu  

  TL;DR:  We develop a sound algorithm for finding invariant predictors that runs in polynomial time and yields predictive performance that is comparable to the existing work.   Abstract:   
 One fundamental problem in machine learning is out-of-distribution generalization. A method named the surgery estimator incorporates the causal structure in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to find predictors that are invariant across target domains using distributional invariances via Pearl‚Äôs do-calculus. However, finding a surgery estimator can take exponential time as the current methods need to search through all possible predictors. In this work, we first provide a graphical characterization of the identifiability of conditional causal queries. Next, we leverage this characterization together with a greedy search step to develop a polynomial-time algorithm for finding invariant predictors using the causal graph. Given the correct causal graph, our method is guaranteed to find at least one invariant predictor, if it exists. We show that our proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the run-time both in simulated and semi-synthetic data experiments and have predictive performance that is comparable to the existing work that runs in exponential time. 
 ID: 775 | Exploiting Long-Range Influences in Learning Generalized Neural Policies for RDDL Relational MDPs   
  
 Vishal Sharma, Daman Arora, Mausam ., Parag Singla  

  TL;DR:  We propose a novel method for handling long range dependencies in neural policies for RDDL RMDPs   Abstract:   
 We focus on the learning of generalized neural policies for Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) expressed in RDDL. Recent work first converts the instances of a relational domain into an instance graph, and then trains a Graph Attention Network (GAT) of fixed depth with parameters shared across instances to learn a state representation, which can be decoded to get the policy Sharma et al. [2022]. Unfortunately, this approach struggles to learn policies that exploit long-range dependencies -- a fact we formally prove in this paper. As a remedy, we first construct a novel influence graph characterized by edges capturing one-step influence (dependence) between nodes based on the transition model. We then define influence distance between two nodes as the shortest path between them in this graph -- a feature we exploit to represent long-range dependencies. We show that our architecture, referred to as Symbolic Influence Network (SINet), with its distance-based features, does not suffer from the representational issues faced by earlier approaches. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that we are competitive with existing baselines on 12 standard IPPC domains, and perform significantly better on six additional domains (including IPPC variants), designed to test a model's capability in capturing long-range dependencies. Further analysis shows that SINet automatically learns to focus on nodes that have key information for representing policies that capture long-range dependencies. 
 ID: 777 | Heavy-tailed Linear Bandit with Huber Regression   
  
 Minhyun Kang, Gi-Soo Kim  

    Abstract:   
 Linear bandit algorithms have been extensively studied and have shown successful in sequential decision tasks despite their simplicity. Many algorithms however work under the assumption that the reward is the sum of linear function of observed contexts and a sub-Gaussian error. In practical applications, errors can be heavy-tailed, especially in financial data. In such reward environments, algorithms designed for sub-Gaussian error may underexplore, resulting in suboptimal regret. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for linear bandits with heavy-tailed errors. The proposed algorithm utilizes Huber regression. When the $(1+\delta)$-th moment of the error is bounded by a constant, we show that the high-probability upper bound of the regret is $O(\sqrt{d}T^{\frac{1}{1+\delta}}(\log T)^{\frac{\delta}{1+\delta}})$, where $d$ is the dimension of context variables, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\delta\in (0,1]$. This bound improves on the state-of-the-art regret bound of the Median of Means and Truncation algorithm by a factor of $\sqrt{\log T}$ and $\sqrt{d}$ for the case where the time horizon $T$ is unknown. We also remark that when $\delta=1$, the order is the same as the regret bound of linear bandit algorithms designed for sub-Gaussian errors. We support our theoretical findings with synthetic experiments. 
 ID: 780 | Best Arm Identification in Rare Events   
  
 Anirban Bhattacharjee, Sushant Vijayan, Sandeep Kumar Juneja  

  TL;DR:  We consider bandit problems where arms return rewards sporadically, and examine interesting approximations that speed up existing best arm algorithms.   Abstract:   
 We consider the best arm identification (BAI) problem in the stochastic multi-armed bandit framework where each arm has a tiny probability of realizing large rewards while with overwhelming probability the reward is zero. A key application of this framework is in online advertising where click rates of advertisements could be a fraction of a single percent and final conversion to sales, while highly profitable, may again be a small fraction of the click rates. Lately, algorithms for BAI problems have been developed that minimise sample complexity while providing statistical guarantees on the correct arm selection. As we observe, these algorithms can be computationally prohibitive. We exploit the fact that the reward process for each arm is well approximated by a Compound Poisson process to arrive at algorithms that are faster, with a small increase in sample complexity. We analyze the problem in an asymptotic regime as rarity of reward occurrence reduces to zero, and reward amounts increase to infinity. This helps illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm. It also sheds light on the underlying structure of the optimal BAI algorithms in the rare event setting. 
 ID: 789 | Exact Count of Boundary Pieces of ReLU Classifiers: Towards the Proper Complexity Measure for Classification   
  
 Pawel Piwek, Adam Klukowski, Tianyang Hu  

  TL;DR:  We propose a method to count the exact number of boundary pieces of ReLU classifiers and empirically demonstrate distinctive features of such boundary complexity vs other function complexities.   Abstract:   
 Classic learning theory suggests that proper regularization is the key to good generalization and robustness. In classification, current training schemes only target the complexity of the classifier itself, which can be misleading and ineffective. Instead, we advocate directly measuring the complexity of the decision boundary. Existing literature is limited in this area with few well-established definitions of boundary complexity. As a proof of concept, we start by analyzing ReLU neural networks, whose boundary complexity can be conveniently characterized by the number of affine pieces. With the help of tropical geometry, we develop a novel method that can explicitly count the exact number of boundary pieces, and as a by-product, the exact number of total affine pieces. Numerical experiments are conducted and distinctive properties of our boundary complexity are uncovered. First, the boundary piece count appears largely independent of other measures, e.g., total piece count, and $l_2$ norm of weights, during the training process. Second, the boundary piece count is negatively correlated with robustness, where popular robust training techniques, e.g., adversarial training or random noise injection, are found to reduce the number of boundary pieces.

  TL;DR:  In this paper, we leverage constraint generation methods to obtain an efficient learning algorithm for the recently proposed minimax risk classifiers (MRCs).   Abstract:   
 High-dimensional} data is common in multiple areas, such as health care and genomics, where the number of features can be hundreds of thousands. In such scenarios, the large number of features often lead to inefficient learning. Constraint generation methods have recently enabled efficient learning of L1-regularized support vector machines (SVM). In this paper, we leverage such methods to obtain an efficient learning algorithm for the recently proposed minimax risk classifiers (MRC). The proposed iterative algorithm also provides a sequence of worst-case error probabilities and performs feature selection. Experiments on multiple high-dimensional datasets show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in high-dimensional scenarios. In addition, the worst-case error probability provides useful information about the classifier performance, and the features selected by the algorithm are competitive with the state-of-the-art.

 Oliver Ethan Richardson, Joseph Halpern, Christopher De Sa  

  TL;DR:  we give the first inference algorithm for probabilistic dependency graphs, prove that it is correct and runs in polynomial time, implement it, and evaluate its performance.   Abstract:   
 Probabilistic dependency graphs (PDGs) are a flexible class of probabilistic graphical models, subsuming Bayesian Networks and Factor Graphs. They can also capture inconsistent beliefs, and provide a way of measuring the degree of this inconsistency. We present the first tractable inference algorithm for PDGs with discrete variables, making the asymptotic complexity of PDG inference similar that of the graphical models they generalize. The key components are: (1) the observation that PDG inference can be reduced to convex optimization with exponential cone constraints, (2) a construction that allows us to express these problems compactly for PDGs of boundeed treewidth, for which we needed to further develop the theory of PDGs, and (3) an appeal to interior point methods that can solve such problems in polynomial time. We verify the correctness and time complexity of our approach, and provide an implementation of it. We then evaluate our implementation, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines approaches.

 Dongfang Sun, Yingzhen Yang  

  TL;DR:  We propose Support Regularized Sparse Graph (SRSG) and a fast proximal gradient descent method to solve the non-convex optimization problem of SRSG with the convergence matching the Nesterov's optimal convergence rate.   Abstract:   
 Sparse graphs built by sparse representation has been demonstrated to be effective in clustering high-dimensional data. Albeit the compelling empirical performance, the vanilla sparse graph ignores the geometric information of the data by performing sparse representation for each datum separately. In order to obtain a sparse graph aligned with the local geometric structure of data, we propose a novel Support Regularized Sparse Graph, abbreviated as SRSG, for data clustering. SRSG encourages local smoothness on the neighborhoods of nearby data points by a well-defined support regularization term. We propose a fast proximal gradient descent method to solve the non-convex optimization problem of SRSG with the convergence matching the Nesterov's optimal convergence rate of first-order methods on smooth and convex objective function with Lipschitz continuous gradient. Extensive experimental results on various real data sets demonstrate the superiority of SRSG over other competing clustering methods. 

  The list above is provisional. Conference proceedings will be published by PMLR  .
