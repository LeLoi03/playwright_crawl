 The design of next-generation networks and future communication systems will be shaped by improved services, leading to greater management complexity for network providers across diverse technology platforms. Innovative networking technologies are essential to efficiently and effectively handle the complexities of traffic demands, particularly with the rise of over-the-top services offered by network data-center operators and individual companies.  
 The focus of IEEE HPSR 2025 is to asses groundbreaking services and technologies and their impact on networks, telecommunications, and supporting data communication systems. To inspire these discussions, we are seeking original and thought-provoking works on switching, routing, and networking and their applied technologies. Submissions on autonomous networks, 5G/6G, IoT, Industry 4.0, cybersecurity, virtualization, and other advanced topics, including AI/ML for communications and networking, are also encouraged.
