 Long-term Research Interests in Multi-discipline AI  

 I am interested in apply AI technologies (Computer vision, Natural language processing, Data analytics, etc.) to assist/support non-AI background researchers from multi-discipline to find the best solution for their research topics. And target joint grant applications and joint supervision opportunities to  cultivate Ph.D. students with comprehensive abilities who can solve research problems using State-of-the-art Technologies. Areas may include but not limited to health  , education  , agriculture  , astronomy  , and engineering  . I am always open to research questions from Multi-discipline and always stay hungry, and stay foolish to the knowledge I do not know.   

 One Research Question  

 Do Deep Neural Network models have a memory to remember things like humans rather than just comparing features?  

 Time in Anywhere on Earth:
