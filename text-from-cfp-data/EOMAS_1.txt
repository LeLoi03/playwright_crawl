 ANNSIM’25 Call For Papers   
   
 The 2025 Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference (ANNSIM’25) is the annual conference sponsored by The Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS), which covers state-of-the-art developments in Modeling & Simulation (M&S). The conference includes keynote speeches presented by technology and industry leaders, technical sessions, and tutorials for professional development. Scientists, engineers, managers, educators, and business professionals who develop or use M&S methodologies and tools are invited to participate and present original contributions.  
 ANNSIM’25 invites original contributions to the theory, methodology, and practice of modeling and simulation in any scientific or engineering discipline. Original, high-quality technical papers are solicited for peer review, presentation, and subsequent publication in the conference proceedings if accepted. Technical papers are max 12 pages long with single column format. Tutorials and Ph.D. Colloquium submissions are 2 pages long. Papers must not have appeared before (or be pending) in a journal or conference with published proceedings, nor may they be under review or submitted to another forum during the ANNSIM’25 review process.  
 Authors of accepted papers are expected to register by the time of camera-ready submission, attend the conference, and present their work to their peers. Accepted technical papers will be submitted to the appropriate Digital Libraries for archiving and will be indexed in Scopus/DBLP and ACM databases.  
 Evaluation criteria: Double-blind submissions will be assessed with respect to their overall contributions, strengths and weaknesses. Feedback will include qualitative comments on these three dimensions as well as quantitative scores. Both qualitative and quantitative feedback will be used by track chairs to suggest a decision, which will then be reviewed by the organizing committee.  
 For any questions contact scs@scs.org

 Author's Kit Information and Submission Link  
 Author’s Kit Instructions and Forms for Papers    
   
 Below you will find PDF forms including general guidelines for preparing and submitting your paper, the required transfer of copyright and author certification form, tips for writing a quality paper, as well as tips for giving a high-quality presentation (all presenters are encouraged to read this). We encourage all submissions to use LaTeX, and we have provided an Overleaf template to simplify the process of starting your paper. Authors are also able to use Word. Please note that these paper templates have changed significantly from previous versions. Please do not use a template from a previous year, as this will cause your manuscript to not be submitted.  
 LaTeX and Word Template and Guidance 
  Overleaf LaTeX template (preferred) 
  Upon Acceptance: | Author’s Kit Forms-Transfer of Copyright and Author Certification 
  At the Conference: | Guidelines for Writing a Good Paper | for the Proceedings of the Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS) 
  At the Conference: | How to Give a Great Presentation 

 General Process to Prepare and Submit a Paper      
   
 Once you decide on a paper template, the general process for preparing and submitting a conference paper is as follows:   
 Decide on a format (LaTeX is recommended but Word and Overleaf is allowed). The overleaf template is a quick way to start. 
  Modify those files to produce your submission. Remember to stay within the page limit and to remove all identifying information, as submissions are double-blind. 
  If your paper is accepted, you will have to submit to the paper submission site the final material: final version of paper (ZIP file), completed & signed Transfer of Copyright form, completed & signed Author Certification form, and a copy of your registration receipt. At least one author must register in advance for each accepted paper and come present it at the conference.

 Policy on the use of AI in research papers:  The use of Generative AI to help with writing some of the paper must be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an SCS publication. Generative AI includes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT. If this use is specific to certain sections of the paper, we encourage authors to identify such sections (e.g., “We used GPT 4 to draft section 3.2”). The policy applies to conferences such as the Annual Modelling & Simulation Conference (ANNSIM), or extended versions submitted to the Society’s journals (Simulation: Transactions of the SCS, The Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation).  

 Since 1952, SCS has been a multidisciplinary society made up of working scientists, researchers, designers, and managers that are focused on promoting the use of computer simulation. Each year, our organization holds multiple events where M&S professionals from around the world come together to advance their career development, share ideas, benchmark processes, and network with each other.  
 SCS hosts or sponsors a number of conferences each year where participants may do the following:  
  • Present Papers  
  • Attend Technical Sessions  
  • Visit Exhibit Areas  
  • Interface with Vendors  
  • Network with Other M&S Professionals  

 What We Do  
 At any of the SCS-sponsored conferences, you may present a paper or attend technical sessions. Either way, you benefit from the professional exchange of information and camaraderie created by the social environment. The conference locations are picked with the family in mind so that they can enjoy the surroundings while you participate in the event.  
 SCS also publishes the proceedings of each conference for distribution to attendees and resale to other M&S professionals. A listing of all our international publications, provided to members free of charge, can be obtained from our office.
