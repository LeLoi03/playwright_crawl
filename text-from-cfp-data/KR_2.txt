 The topic of the track covers an important field of research in Artificial Intelligence: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning ( KRR  ) is indeed a trending topic, with its subfield of Argumentation theory gaining significant attention. The KRR  track serves as a venue for researchers and practitioners working on the fundamentals and applications of reasoning, fostering cross-fertilization among different approaches such as Argumentation and Belief Revision.  
 KRR  is a crucial area of artificial intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations to capture information about the world, enabling the solution of complex problems. The primary goal is to understand and construct intelligent behaviour from a top-down perspective, determining what an agent needs to know to behave intelligently, how this knowledge can be symbolically represented, and how automated reasoning procedures can utilise this knowledge effectively. A fundamental assumption in KRR  is that an agent's knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated reasoning engines. Topics of interest include argumentation, constraint solving, programming, technologies, belief revision and update, belief merging, commonsense reasoning, contextual reasoning, description logics, diagnosis, abduction, explanation, inconsistency- and exception-tolerant reasoning, para-consistent logics, KR and autonomous agents (intelligent agents, cognitive robotics, multi-agent systems), KR and decision making (game theory, social choice), KR and machine learning (inductive logic programming, knowledge discovery and acquisition), logic programming (answer set programming, constraint logic programming), non-monotonic logics (default logics, conditional logics), preferences (modelling and representation, preference-based reasoning), reasoning about knowledge and belief (dynamic epistemic logic, epistemic and doxastic logics), reasoning systems and solvers, knowledge compilation, spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning (qualitative reasoning), uncertainty, and representations of vagueness (many-valued and fuzzy logics).  
 The KRR  track has been a significant part of the SAC conference for several years, showcasing cutting-edge research and developments in this field. Below is a list of the editions of KRR  :
