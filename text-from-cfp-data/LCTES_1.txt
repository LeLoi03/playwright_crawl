  Welcome to the 18 th  Annual ACM SIGPLAN / SIGBED 2017 Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES 2017).  
 LCTES provides a link between the programming languages and embedded systems engineering communities. Researchers and developers in these areas are addressing many similar problems, but with different backgrounds and approaches. LCTES is intended to expose researchers and developers from either area to relevant work and interesting problems in the other area and provide a forum where they can interact.

 Time Band   
   
 By setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).  
  The time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.   Display full program    Specify a time band   -

 Call for Papers  
  
 Embedded system design faces many challenges both with respect to functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements, many of which are conflicting. They are found in areas such as design and developer productivity, verification, validation, maintainability, and meeting performance goals and resource constraints. Novel design-time and run-time approaches are needed to meet the demand of emerging applications and to exploit new hardware paradigms, and in particular to scale up to multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from multicores.  
   
  LCTES 2017 will take place at the premises of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)  , located in the south of Barcelona, close to the airport and to the city centre.  
 LCTES 2017 solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications.  
   
  Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics in embedded systems:  
 Programming language challenges, including: 
  Domain-specific languages 
  Features to exploit multicore, reconfigurable, and other emerging architectures 
  Features for distributed, adaptive, and real-time control embedded systems 
  Language capabilities for specification, composition, and construction of embedded systems 
  Language features and techniques to enhance reliability, verifiability, and security 
  Virtual machines, concurrency, inter-processor synchronization, and memory management 
  Compiler challenges, including: 
  Interaction between embedded architectures, operating systems, and compilers 
  Interpreters, binary translation, just-in- time compilation, and split compilation 
  Support for enhanced programmer productivity 
  Support for enhanced debugging, profiling, and exception/interrupt handling 
  Optimization for low power/energy, code and data size, and best-effort and real-time performance 
  Parameterized and structural compiler design space exploration and auto-tuning 
  Tools for analysis, specification, design, and implementation, including: 
  Hardware, system software, application software, and their interfaces 
  Distributed real-time control, media players, and reconfigurable architectures 
  System integration and testing 
  Performance estimation, monitoring, and tuning 
  Run-time system support for embedded systems 
  Design space exploration tools 
  Support for system security and system-level reliability 
  Approaches for cross-layer system optimization 
  Theory and foundations of embedded systems, including: 
  Predictability of resource behaviour: energy, space, time 
  Validation and verification, in particular of concurrent and distributed systems 
  Formal foundations of model-based design as basis for code generation, analysis, and verification 
  Mathematical foundations for embedded systems 
  Models of computations for embedded applications 
  Novel embedded architectures, including: 
  Design and implementation of novel architectures 
  Workload analysis and performance evaluation 
  Architecture support for new language features, virtualization, compiler techniques, debugging tools 
  Architectural features to improve power/energy, code/data size, and predictability 
  Mobile systems and IoT, including: 
  Operating systems for mobile and IoT devices 
  Compiler and software tools for mobile and IoT systems 
  Energy management for mobile and IoT devices 
  Memory and IO techniques for mobile and IoT devices 
  Empirical studies and their reproduction, and confirmation 
   
  All accepted papers will appear in the published proceedings. We expect to make a best paper award.   
   
  Important Dates:   

 Paper submission: | 20 February 2017 (11:59 PM EST) 
 Author notification: | 31 March 2017 
 Final version: | 15 April 2017 (tentative) 

 Submission  
  
 Formatting Guidelines:   
  Submissions must be in ACM proceedings format, 9-point type, and may not exceed 10 pages (all inclusive). Word and LaTeX templates for this format are available on the ACM website  . Submissions must be in PDF, printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules:  
 author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, 
  references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). 
  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.  
  
 The submission site is: https://lctes17.hotcrp.com
