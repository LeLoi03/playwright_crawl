 Abstract :  When performing a Tate pairing (or a derivative thereof) on an ordinary pairing-friendly elliptic curve, the computation can be looked at as having two stages, the Miller loop and the so-called final exponentiation. As a result of good progress being made to reduce the Miller loop component of the algorithm (particularly with the discovery of "truncated loop" pairings like the R-ate pairing [18]), the final exponentiation has become a more significant component of the overall calculation. Here we exploit the structure of pairing-friendly elliptic curves to reduce to a minimum the computation required for the final exponentiation.

  TL;DR:  In this paper, the Tate pairing with degree 2, 3, 4, 4 or 6 twist was shown to have faster doubling and addition steps than the original Tate and ate pairing, and it was shown how these faster formulas can be applied to all practical suggestions for eﬃcient pairing implementations over large prime characteristic.
