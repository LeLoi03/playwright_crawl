 PoEM 2015 Short Papers Foreword       
 The  8 th  IFIP  WG  8.1  working  c onference  on  the  Practice  of  Enterprise  Model l    ing     
 ( PoEM  2015 ) was  held in  Valencia ,    Spain,  from  10 to  12  November  2015 . Since  its     
 foundation in 2008, the PoEM  conference series aims at understanding and imp  roving      
 the  practice  of  Enterprise  Modelling  (EM)  by  offering   a  forum  for  sharing   
 experiences and knowledge  between the  academic community  and practitioners  from     
 industry  and  the  public  sector. It  has  traditionally  covered    topics   such  as  EM   and   
 information  system  development,  enterprise  arch  itecture,  business  and  IT  alignment,   
 EM  and business  process  improvement,  Enterprise  modelling  too  ls an  d f  rameworks,    
 quality  issues  in  EM,  change  management  and  organizational  transformation   
 underpinned by information technology approaches.    
 This edition, PoEM received  72 submissions covering a large variety of EM topics.      
 All  submissions  were  subject  to  peer  review  and  were  assessed  by  at  least  3   
 Programme  Commit  tee  members,   who  provided  constructive  recommendations  for    
 further  improvement .  This  CEUR  Proceedings  volume  contains  the  accepted  9  short    
 papers.  Full  papers  are  available  in  the  PoEM  201 5   Proceedings,  published      by   
 Springer on  the  volume  235  of  their  Lecture  Notes  in  Business  Information      
 Processing series  .  The  authors  of  the se  short  papers represent      8  countries:  Brazil,       
 Germany,  Israel  ,  Italy  ,  Luxembourg  ,    Norway  ,  Sweden  and  Swit  zerland .  T he  papers         
 were  presented  in  two  sessions:  Reflecting  on  Practice  and  Experiences ,  and       
 Approaching Enter  prise Modelling  from New Angles .    
 We owe special  thanks  to  the  authors  who  submitted papers,  for  their  trust  in the      
 relev ance  and  rigour  of  this  conference,  and  to  the  members  of  the  i nternational       
 Program Com  mittee and  additional  reviewers,  for prom  oting the  conference,  as  well     
 as for providing valuable reviews for the submitted papers. We are  also grateful to the    
 PoEM  Steer  ing  Committee  Chairs  for  their  continuous  assistanc  e and    to  the  local    
 organising team at the Universi tat Polit è   cnica de Val è    ncia  for their hospitality and the   
 organisation of  the  so cial  events  of  the  conference. Furthermore,  we   appreciate    how   
 the Session C hairs and audience contributed to experience     lively Short Paper sessions.

 PoEM 2015 Doctoral Consortium Foreword    
 PoEM 2015  has  organised  and  held  a  Doctoral  Consortium  for the  first  time  in  this     
 series of conferences. The ambition behind  was to enrich the PoEM conference with  a   
 forum  intended  to  bring  together  PhD   students  working  on  foundations,  methods,   
 tools and appli cations of Enterprise Modelling, and provide them w  ith the opportunity    
 to present and discuss their research  with other academics.    
 In  p  articular,  the  goals  of  the  Doctoral  Consortium   were  to  provide  fruitful   
 feedback  and  advice  to  the  selected PhD  students  on  their  research  studies,  to  meet     
 senior  academics  do  ing  research  on  topics  related  to  the  Enterprise  Modelling   
 discipline,  as  well  as  to  interact w  ith other  PhD   students and  stimulate  exchange  of   
 ideas and suggestions among p  articipants.    
 The  PoEM  2015  D octoral  Consortium  received  8  submissions  from  Belgium,    
 Canada,  France, Germany,  Italy,  Sweden, Tunisia  and  United  Kingdom,  5  of  which   
 were accepted. Eac  h paper was reviewed by t  wo members of the Progra  m Committee,   
 and also assessed by the Doctoral Consort ium Chairs.     
 The  Doctoral  Consortium  included  a  tuto  rial  by  Prof.  Paul  Johannesson  from   
 Stockholm University, “Design Science - a Ritual  for Legitimating Weak Research or     
 a  Tool  for  Making  Research  Relevant?”  In  addition  the  five  accepted  papers  w  ere   
 presented and discussed.    
 We would like to express our  gratitude to the mento  rs of the Doctoral Consor  tium,   
 as  well  as  to  the mem  bers  of  the  Program  Committee for  their   efforts  in  providing   
 very thorough evaluations of the  submitted doctoral papers. We also wish  to thank all     
 PhD  students  who  submitted  papers  for  having  shared  their  work  with  us.  We  owe   
 special  thanks  to  the  Programme  Chairs  and  the  Local  Organisation  Committee  of   
 PoEM 2015 for their support.
