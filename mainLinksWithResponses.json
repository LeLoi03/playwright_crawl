While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. Our field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. We promote the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers but also engineers and practitioners to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice.  \n HCOMP 2024 is colocated with ACM UIST 2024  (October 13-16, 2024).  \n     \n HCOMP 2024 builds on a successful history of past meetings  : eleven HCOMP conferences (2013–2023) and four earlier workshops, held at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2011–2012), and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2009–2010).  \n\n Announcements  \n Registration is now open!   \n The HCOMP Test of Time and Impact Award  will be announced and given out this year!

ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40)  .  \n Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.  \n ANT will be held in Patra Greece. Patra is Greece's third largest, and the regional capital and largest city of western Greece, in the northern Peloponnese, 215 km west of Athens. As of the 2021 census, the municipality of Patras has a population of 215,922, while the urban population is 173.600. Patras and its region are home to various Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monuments including the Roman Odeon, the Fortress of Rio, and the Castle of Patras. Patras is a relatively newly built city, as its medieval buildings were destroyed in the Greek War of Independence. The Patras Carnival is the largest event of its kind in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe, with a heritage reaching back 160 years.  \n Patras is an important educational center in Greece, home to several institutions of higher education, including the prestigious University of Patras, which is the third largest university in Greece with the respect to the size of the student body, the staff, and the number of departments. and most respected universities. The university of Patras is considered one of the top-ranked universities in Greece and has been placed in the top 200 universities in subject areas. In 2019, the student population was more than 33,000 (29,901 at the undergraduate level and 3,931 at the postgraduate level).  \n All ANT 2025 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (https://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/).

Bringing together top researchers and practitioners, CSCW 2025 will explore topics across sociotechnical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, design, entertainment, and ethics, including social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, and technologies for co-located or remote collaboration, communication, education, work articulation, coordination, awareness, and information sharing.  \n Papers are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems; or introduce new approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems. Submissions exploring how computing technologies — including those linked to recent developments in AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR — relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, providing they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues  . Submissions by members of underrepresented groups are particularly welcome. Authors exploring historical and sociotechnical perspectives on CSCW systems are also encouraged to submit.  \n We invite contributions to CSCW across a variety of human-centered research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including:  \n Social and crowd computing. | Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds, or collaborative information behaviors. \n  CSCW and social computing system development. | Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that are explored and discussed within the context of building new social and collaborative systems and experiences. \n  Methodologies and tools. | Novel human-centered methods, or combinations of approaches and tools used in building collaborative systems or studying their use. \n  Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses. | Studies of technologically enabled social, cooperative, and collaborative practices within and beyond work settings illuminating their historical, social, and material specificity, and/or exploring their political or ethical dimensions. \n  Empirical investigations. | Findings, guidelines, and/or studies of social practices, communication, cooperation, collaboration, or use, as related to CSCW and social technologies. \n  Domain-specific social, cooperative, and collaborative applications. | Including applications to healthcare, transportation, design, manufacturing, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains. \n  Ethics and policy implications. | Analysis of the implications of sociotechnical systems in social, cooperative and collaborative practices, as well as the algorithms that shape them. \n  CSCW and social computing systems based on emerging technologies. | Including mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, computer-aided or robotically-supported work, and sensing systems. \n  Crossing boundaries. | Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across fields of research, disciplines, distances, languages, generations, and cultures to help better understand how CSCW and social systems might help transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries. \n  Send queries about paper submissions to papers2025@cscw.acm.org  .  \n To promote work-life balance, we have set all deadlines on Tuesdays to avoid weekends at any time zone.  \n SUBMISSION PROCESS   \n SUBMISSION MODEL   \n To support diverse and high-quality contributions, CSCW uses a two-cycle review process with the opportunity for major revisions reviewed by the same reviewers. Accepted papers are published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction  (PACM HCI) Journal.  \n CSCW 2025 will follow the half-yearly submission model implemented in CSCW 2022. Thus, new paper submissions will be only possible for the July 2024  and October 2024  deadlines. We have four additional deadlines in December, March, April, and July for revisions only. Failure to submit a revised version of a paper by the associated deadline means that the paper has been withdrawn.  \n Below is an overview of the submission timeline. All a  ccepted papers from these two cycles will be invited to present at CSCW 2025.   \n   JULY 2024 CYCLE   \n July 2, 2024: | New paper submissions due 23:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time. | Expected notification date: | Oct 9, 2024 AoE. \n  Possible outcomes: | Major Revisions, Minor Revisions, Reject. \n  October 29, 2024: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Nov 19, 2024. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept or Reject. \n  December 10, 2024: | Resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Feb 12, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept with Minor Revisions, Reject. \n  March 4, 2025: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation after Major Revisions due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Mar 26, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept or Reject. \n  OCTOBER 2024 CYCLE   \n October 29, 2024: | New paper submissions due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Feb 12, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Major Revisions, Minor Revisions, Reject. \n  March 4, 2025: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Mar 26, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept or Reject. \n  April 15, 2025: | Resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Jun 11, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept with Minor Revisions, Reject. \n  Jul 1, 2025: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation after Major Revisions due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Aug 6, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept or Reject. \n  2025 Submissions   \n The next paper submission deadline is expected to be in May 2025. This will be announced by the 2026 Chairs once the submission deadline is finalized.  \n PROCESS DETAILS   \n CSCW 2025 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com  . Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the SIGCHI Submission and Review Policy, including, but not limited to:  \n That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. \n  Occasionally, a paper may have some overlap with a prior publication (for example, there is some overlap with the datasets used, but the analyses in each paper are considered to be a completely different and substantial contribution). This | must | be disclosed to the editorial team at the time of submission. Authors must provide a detailed explanation of the overlap and distinct contribution of each paper in the “Comments (optional)” field on the submission form. Please make sure to refer and adhere to the ACM policy in reuse of content from prior publications available at: | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions \n  Similarly, for parallel submissions (authors submitting multiple papers related to the same study), authors also need to provide information about the relationship between submissions, as well as how they are different from one another in the “Comments (optional)” field of the submission form. Please make sure to refer and adhere to the ACM policy in simultaneous submissions available at: | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions \n  That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. \n  For information about re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to section 1.5.4 of the ACM SIGCHI policy.  \n Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the PACM HCI and the ACM Digital Library.  \n Authors should adhere to the new ACM policy in authorship, available at https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship  .  \n PAPER GUIDELINES REGARDING SCOPE   \n CSCW is a broad and interdisciplinary field, covering many methods, theories, and epistemologies. It is difficult to draw explicit disciplinary boundaries of what counts and what does not count as CSCW research. Nonetheless, in the spirit of welcoming those new and not as familiar to CSCW, we believe it is beneficial to offer some guidelines when deciding whether your submissions are appropriate for CSCW.  \n In general, contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation  and be  properly contextualized   in the CSCW literature  , with clear reference to CSCW concepts and/or theories informing, being affected or being proposed. Please note that papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to individual users will be considered out of scope. For example, this would include papers whose major contribution is on user research findings that inform the design of a system primarily focused on benefiting a sole, individual user. Also, systems-based or algorithmic research not making explicit how it involves aspects of cooperative, collaborative or social computing are not within the scope of CSCW.  \n Therefore, authors should clearly answer yes to the following:  \n Does your work build upon, bridge, discuss, or cite prior CSCW work in a significant manner? Does it make clear how it offers new knowledge of benefit to the CSCW community? \n  Have you clearly elaborated on how the results of your work are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions? \n  Authors must make sure that their submission is within the scope of the conference. During the submission, authors will be asked to write a short paragraph explaining how this is the case. Contributions out of scope will be desk rejected.   The scope statement should be fully anonymized to ensure the double-blind review process – see section on anonymous review policy below. Please ensure your statement does not contain any information that can identify any of the authors, their institutions, partners, or cities.  \n ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   \n Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names  and affiliations  removed, including references to universities, institutional review boards,   companies, labs, and cities  . Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Furthermore, obvious identifying statements and information that might confuse reviewers regarding the authors (e.g., mock authors’ names originally in templates provided to demonstrate formatting) should be removed. Images used in the paper must NOT disclose the authors identity or suggest affiliation. This policy includes all submitted materials, including supplemental materials and the scope statement. Papers that violate this policy will be desk rejected.    \n Please check in particular the first page, headers and footers, images, the acknowledgements section, AND meta-data of all   submitted file   s   .  For resubmissions, make sure that the authors’ identities are not disclosed in the annotated document submitted in addition to the clean version. If possible, check the document with tracked changes in different PDF readers. It is possible that some tracked-change information that is visible in a reader (e.g., Adobe Acrobat) is not visible in others (e.g., Preview).  \n Citations to authors’ own relevant work should NOT be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work…”  \n CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the peer review process, we ask that no authors publicize the work until the review process is complete  . Please do not share any confidential information specific to a current review process publicly or on social media, with the exception of doing public exhibitions, festivals, and performances as part of the research where the name is integral to the work.  \n When submitting your papers to PCS, please also ensure your scope statement follows the anonymous review policy.  \n We also ask reviewers to refrain from taking steps to learn about authors’ identity during the peer review process.  \n FORMATTING AND LENGTH   \n Word authors:  Because CSCW papers are published in PACM HCI, which uses the Sheridan service, authors need to use the old interim ACM Small template,  which is ONLY available at the following link:  \n  https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates   \n LaTeX authors  need to use the template at  \n  https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions  , and insert the acmsmall call.  \n Overleaf authors  need to use the template at  \n  https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf  , and use the acmsmall call.  \n Papers that use a completely different template will be  desk rejected.    Small variance on font styles, which is possible when authors do not have particular fonts installed in their computers, will be tolerated for the initial submission but will have to be fixed in case the paper is accepted for publication.  \n Note:  In preparing revisions, authors should continue using the template they had used for their original submissions. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. If a paper is shorter than 5000 words or exceeds 12,000 words, it will be submitted to additional scrutiny. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be  rejected   .  Note that additional materials can be submitted as appendices but be aware that reviewers are not bound to decide based on these materials.  \n POLICY ON USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs) AND OTHER AI TOOLS   \n If AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were used in the writing of the paper beyond a simple grammar check, their use should be acknowledged and described in the text of the submitted version. ACM policy  states that authors must be the “creator or originator of an idea” and/or work, so relying on AI-tools to generate ideas in the manuscript is not allowed. Note that we will investigate submissions brought to our attention for undeclared use of LLMs or other AI-tools.  \n DECISIONS AND DEADLINES   \n CSCW will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 2-4 months from the initial submission (depending on the cycle). For the July 2024 submission deadline, we hope to send out all final notifications by Mar 26, 2025, i.e., after final acceptance of papers that receive a Major Revisions notification after initial submission. For the October 2024 submission deadline, all final notifications should be out by Aug 6, 2025, i.e., after final acceptance of papers that initially received a Major Revisions recommendation for that cycle.  \n Accept: | Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted for verification by the corresponding Associate Chair (1AC). The submission will appear in an upcoming issue of the PACM HCI. \n  Minor revision: | Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication. The revised submission MUST be submitted along with a brief response to the reviewers’ comments. The revision will be verified by the corresponding Associate Chair (1AC) and if approved, the submission will be promoted to an accepted paper. \n  Major revision: | Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, then re-reviewed. For July 2024 submissions receiving a Major Revision decision must be resubmitted by the December 2024 deadline. For October 2024 submissions, major revisions are due in April 2025. The authors must ensure that the paper has been revised sufficiently to warrant re-review. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same AC and reviewers for re-review. Upon re-review, submissions can receive one of two decisions: Accept with minor revisions or Reject. Unlike most journals, the current CSCW review process does NOT allow for more than one major revision recommendation due to reviewer availability and time constraints. \n  Reject: | Authors of rejected papers are allowed to resubmit their papers under special conditions. Please refer to the section | Resubmission of Rejected and Withdrawn Papers. \n  Desk / Quick Reject: | Authors should only submit completed work of | publishable quality | and | within the scope of ACM CSCW | . Editors will | desk reject | papers that do not comply with such requirements. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will also be | desk rejected | without review. Finally, the ACs, in cooperation with the Editors, may Quick Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. While we endeavor to notify authors early in the process, desk or quick rejects may happen at | any time | throughout the review process up until notifications. \n  RESUBMISSION OF REJECTED AND WITHDRAWN PAPERS   \n Papers in the following categories can be resubmitted at the next submission deadline:  \n Papers that have been desk or quick rejected \n  Papers that got Minor Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn) \n  Papers that gets rejected after resubmitting Major Revisions \n  On the other hand, papers that fall in one of the following categories must wait an extra deadline to be resubmitted:  \n Papers that get rejected in first review round \n  Papers that got Major Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn) \n  For example, if the paper was rejected after the initial submission in July 2024, authors cannot re-submit in the October 2024 cycle, but can resubmit the paper after    the October 2024 cycle.  \n Please notice that all resubmitted papers will be treated as a new submission, meaning they will most likely be assigned to a new Editor, new ACs, and new reviewers. Papers resubmitted with no or marginal changes (except resubmission of minor revisions papers that missed the resubmission deadline) will be desk rejected  without review.  \n Authors must describe the paper’s submission history and briefly outline the changes in a designated field in PCS when resubmitting. Failure to disclose the paper’s submission history may lead to a desk reject  decision. ACs and reviewers will have access to this description of the paper’s submission history and may also request to review the detailed submission history.  \n DECISION APPEAL PROCESS   \n We recognize that authors may sometimes feel a review is unfair, inappropriate, or problematic in other ways. CSCW has implemented the following process for authors who wish to appeal a decision:  \n Either: | Authors directly contact the Papers Chairs to officially appeal a decision \n  A committee member (1AC / 2AC / Editor / Papers Chair) raises an issue about the decision or decision-making process, possibly in response to a communication from an author \n  The appeal involves motivating the case with evidence \n  Papers Chairs assess the situation and make an initial call to bring it up for discussion with the Editors \n  The Editor assigned to the submission reviews the paper, the reviews, and the discussion in PCS to determine if the case is valid. The Editor may choose to involve the ACs at this stage \n  Other Editors weigh in and review the case \n  The Editors come to a collective decision and share their decision with the Papers Chairs \n  The Papers Chairs discuss the Editors’ decision. If a change is agreed, Papers Chairs record the updated decision in PCS \n  The Papers Chairs communicate the final decision to the authors. Decisions are final and further appeals will not be pursued. \n  Appeals must be submitted no later than seven days after the decision notification is out. Any appeal submitted after that time limit will not be pursued.   \n PRIMARY RESEARCH PARADIGM   \n When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be asked to indicate the primary research paradigm of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment. Currently there are six paradigm choices available:  \n Technical/Systems, e.g., building novel CSCW systems, algorithms, implementing novel features in existing systems, etc. \n  Empirical–Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, workplace studies, qualitative user studies, etc. \n  Empirical–Quantitative, e.g., “big data,” quantitative user studies, statistical methods, etc. \n  Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research, design explorations combined with technical feature development, etc. \n  Design, e.g., design implications, guidelines, methods, techniques, etc. \n  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning CSCW studies/domains, theoretical analysis, literature reviews, and essays, etc. \n  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE   \n Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. Authors are encouraged to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors are also encouraged to use open access repositories and make their data and other material FAIR when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to describe efforts to make their work more reproducible. Reviewers are encouraged to support evolving approaches to supporting open and transparent research practices.  \n VIDEO FIGURES   \n Authors may consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission (no more than three minutes long). Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.  \n PRESENTING AT THE CONFERENCE   \n Accepted papers are invited to present at the corresponding conference, and authors can choose whether or not they wish to present. If a situation arises and an author who is scheduled to present at the conference is no longer able to, they should immediately reach out to the Papers Chairs to discuss alternative options. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required.  \n PAPERS CHAIRS   \n Contact:  papers2025@cscw.acm.org   \n Xiaojuan Ma (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR) \n  Xinru Page (Brigham Young University, USA) \n  Chiara Rossitto (Stockholm University, Sweden) \n  Norman Makoto Su (University of California, Santa Cruz, USA) \n  GENERAL CHAIRS   \n Contact:  chairs2025@cscw.acm.org    \n Fabiano Pinatti (University of Oslo, Norway) \n  Jessica Vitak (University of Maryland, USA) \n\n Copyright © 2024 CSCW 2025 | Powered by Astra WordPress Theme   \n\n    Scroll to Top",

This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The new SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field.   \n ACM SenSys 2025  will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, but retaining the current SenSys name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) due to the time required for institutional approvals. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. We are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.   \n\n Latest News  \n 11/07/2024    \n Abstract registration is now optional.     \n\n Abstract registration before paper submission is now optional.

Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  \n OOPSLA 2025 will have two rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline October 15, 2024  and Round 2 submission deadline March 25, 2025  (AoE). All deadlines are firm. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.  \n What’s New   \n There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:  \n Reserve Reviewer Policy \n  Data-Availability Statement \n  Contact   \n You can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email:  \n oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com    Please use this address, not  their personal email addresses, unless  you think they are not getting your messages. Please allow 1–2 working days for a response before assuming they didn’t see your message, and longer right around deadlines.  \n In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one). That makes it easier to track the context (and avoids ambiguity).  \n Review Process   \n PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.  \n At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:  \n Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  \n Reject  : Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.  \n Conditional Accept  : While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.  \n Minor Revision  : While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.  \n Major Revision  : While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.  \n If you receive one of the latter three decisions, please note:  \n If you choose to submit a revised paper, you must also submit both (a) a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and (b) unless impossible, a diff of the PDFs. Independent of the decision, you can submit at the next deadline (either the opening deadline of the next round or the revision deadline of the current round). To the extent possible, your submission will be reviewed by the same reviewers. \n  Unless you explicitly withdraw your paper, it is considered under review  . Therefore, it would violate policy to submit it elsewhere. If you choose to withdraw the paper (e.g., to submit elsewhere), the next time you submit it, it will be treated as a fresh paper: you may get entirely different reviewers, previous reviews and comments will not be available, etc. \n  Until your paper is accepted or rejected, you should maintain the anonymity of your submission. If you believe you need to violate it to respond to the reviews, please first discuss this with the Chairs. \n  If the Artifact Evaluation submission deadline occurs before the decision date, you will be invited to submit artifacts. However, acceptance of artifacts has no impact on the acceptance of the revised papers. \n  Reserve Reviewer Policy   \n To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS  .  \n Instructions  : Log into TPMS with the same email address as for your HotCRP account. The system will ask you to upload (or provide URLs for) 5-10 of your previous papers, to base your matching on. Uploading papers/URLs is pretty straightforward; here’s also a step-by-step video  . You get to choose which papers you want to upload; these determine what papers you are most likely to be asked to review. So please go for both depth and breadth. In particular, please provide papers on topics for which you are a relatively rare expert.  \n  \n The goal of this policy is to uphold the high standard of reviews within the SIGPLAN community. To achieve this, we must ensure manageable review loads, prevent burnout, and encourage reviewers to stay engaged for future rounds. High-quality reviews are one of the community’s greatest assets, playing a crucial role in elevating the quality of research for everyone.  \n Our hope is that these reserve reviewers won’t be needed at all! They will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our projections fall significantly short. Even in that case, their review load will be far lighter than that of RC members, and we will do our best to assign papers that closely match expertise (hence the need for TPMS registration).  \n We define “senior” authors as those who completed their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer policy if:  \n The paper has no senior authors. \n  At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference. \n  Every | senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria: | is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before); \n  is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year; \n  has some other exceptional circumstance that didn’t prevent writing the paper but prevents doing any reviewing. This must be cleared at least three days before submission with the RC Chairs. \n  It is okay for one person to serve as the reserve reviewer for more than one paper. Please enter their information for each such paper (preferably identically).  \n Submissions   \n Template   \n SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the SIGPLAN author information  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  \n Page Limit   \n Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material (such as appendices). However, papers must be self-contained; reviewers are under no obligation to read the supplementary material.  \n Revisions can go up to a maximum of 25 pages  . This includes papers given a minor or major revision in 2024, as well as the final, camera-ready papers. For fairness, there will not be an option to purchase additional pages. For the final paper, we ask you to stick as closely as possible to the final version accepted by reviewers, and only add material that reviewers requested.  \n Anonymity   \n PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must  \n omit author names and institutions, \n  use the third person when referencing your work, \n  anonymize supplementary material. \n  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  \n Novelty   \n Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  \n Data-Availability Statement   \n To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled Data-Availability Statement  in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit, but please limit it to at most a few paragraphs (usually one paragraph suffices).  \n In it, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section should ideally also include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on that reviewers may find useful (but are not obliged to follow). The statement is not meant to be a detailed description of how to use  the artifact; that should accompany the artifact itself.  \n It is understood that some papers have no artifacts but, given the broad range of what constitutes an artifact, it would be helpful to readers to explain why the paper has none.  \n Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain why they did not do so.  \n Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper.  \n Procedure   \n Please submit using HotCRP  .  \n Publication   \n PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.  \n The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than April 1, 2025, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than October 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n ACM Policies   \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID iD  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has made a commitment to collecting ORCID iDs from all of our published authors  . ORCID iDs help improve author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID iD will help in these efforts.  \n The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  \n Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process \n  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors \n  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship \n  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details \n  You can find the updated policy here  .  \n FAQ   \n What are reviewers looking for?   \n We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  \n Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  \n Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  \n Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, and anecdotes.  \n Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology, and results clearly.  \n How are papers from previous years handled?   \n We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we try to assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) we strongly discourage reviewers from giving another “major revision” decision.  \n Are artifacts required?   \n No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the nature of the paper’s content and claims suggest there ought to be an artifact, authors must explain why they will not be providing one. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.  \n Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   \n Yes. Sometimes artifacts are rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the research results (e.g., packaging issues).  \n What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   \n Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity completely undiscoverable (e.g., if a reviewer does a Web search for the text of your paper) but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without knowing who you are. This includes omitting your names from your title page, and referring to your own work in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]”, you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. It is best to suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.  \n Should I change the name of my system?   \n No. However, if it is not a new system and is likely to be known to others, you should refer to it as if it were created by a third party, rather than as your own creation.  \n My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   \n Cite the code in your paper, but replace the URL with text like “link removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  \n I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper. Should I anonymize reference to that work?   \n Yes, you should treat it like any other anonymization. But you should also change the title of the paper to break a direct link between the two.  \n Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?   \n We want to help you navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs. When in doubt about any of these guidelines, please first check in with the Review Committee Chairs: better safe than sorry. (If the Chairs give you permission, they can then also address any subsequent complaints about those actions from reviewers.)  \n Things you may  do:  \n Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites. \n  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. \n  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. \n  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. \n  Things you should not  do  :  \n Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. \n  Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings. For example, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate.

Over the years ISS has been a venue for research and applications of interactive surfaces as well as spaces, which has been acknowledged by the incorporation of 'Space' into our conference identity since 2016.  \n Interactive Surfaces and Spaces increasingly pervade our everyday life, appearing in various sizes, shapes, and application contexts, offering a rich variety of ways to interact.  \n The ISS steering committee members are looking forward to your contribution and participation at the ISS.  \n   \n Upcoming Event  \n    \n Past Events  \n\n Call for bids: Hosting future ISS Conferences  \n   \n We are soliciting expressions of interest for chairing and hosting the ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (formerly ACM Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces) conference in 2025 or 2026.  \n ISS is a successful ACM conference series that consistently attracts up to 200 attendees and high-quality paper submissions. It is celebrating its 19 th  edition in Vancouver, BC, Canada, from October 27-30, 2024 (see https://iss.acm.org/2024/  ).  \n As a first step before submitting a PDF with your bid, you might want to send us a lightweight expression of interest. If you are interested in hosting ISS we just need you to reply with an e-mail that indicates:  \n Main contact person (at least provisionally), and e-mail. \n  Possible geographical location (no need for detail at the moment—a hotel, city, or region is OK). \n  Which of 2025 or 2026 you are interested in organizing (it's okay to indicate one as a backup). \n  We welcome bids from teams hosting other conferences (i.e., we are open to co-location).  \n After your e-mail we will follow up about further details (e.g., putting together an organizing team), selecting dates, etc.  \n  Alternatively, you might also send us the complete bid directly as a PDF document with the content as indicated below.  \n In either case, please get back to us by responding to the ACM ISS steering committee ( steering@iss.acm.org  ).  \n   \n Bidding Process for ACM ISS  \n A call for bids for ACM ISS is issued by the SC Chair (typically, in November) and sent to all the members of the ACM ISS Program Committee and the wider ACM ISS community. Bids will continue to be accepted until the venues are decided. We will begin reviewing bids as they are received. As a formal bid, bidders should submit a single PDF document to the SC with the following information:  \n The proposal should address each aspect outlined below (approx. 5-6 pages). A PDF document providing further details on the content of the bid can be found here  .  Based on the merits of the proposals and when the proposals are submitted, the committee will choose the top candidates and then a finalist will be chosen and announced.   \n Location  \n Since ISS is an international forum, we expect that attendees travel from different parts of the world to the conference location. It is important that the proposed location is conveniently located for all attendees to reach by available means of transportation. Learning from experiences during the worldwide pandemic, we appreciate the inclusion of concepts for running hybrid conferences.  \n   \n Time  \n ISS conferences have been held at various times during around early / mid November. Your bid should include a proposed time within that range with key dates (e.g., paper submission and notification). The choice of time should also take into account the weather conditions of the proposed location to avoid potential weather-caused travel delays and potential conflicts with other conferences and their submission deadlines (e.g., CHI, CSCW and most importantly UIST).  \n   \n Venue  \n ISS officially includes four days with the workshops and tutorials on its first day, which need to be hosted in separate rooms (10-20 people) in parallel. To encourage interaction among the attendees, during the main conference, it is also desirable to have additional space at the venue to put up ISS posters for the attendees to visit during coffee breaks.  \n   \n Accommodation & Travel Costs  \n Most attendees will travel by plane and need accommodation during the conference period. One of the responsibilities of the conference hosts/organizers is to locate and reserve a bulk of affordable lodging for attendees. Please describe the proposed accommodation options, including the price range of the hotel rooms and the distance to the main venue and approximate travel costs, at the time of the conference from major centres in Europe, US, Asia/Pacific.  \n   \n Provisionary Budget Plan  \n The proposal should also include a provisional budget plan, outlining the cost of major items, including the rental of conference venue, cost/per person for the reception and banquet, and the estimated conference registration fee. Please consider including meals for participants into the budget.  \n   \n Hosts/Organizers  \n Conference hosts/organizers should have knowledge of the ISS community (e.g., having attended and published regularly at ISS) and have experience with conference organization. One of the main ISS goals is to bring together people from diverse backgrounds. So ensuring the diversity of the organizing committee is highly encouraged and preferred. Please include short bios of the key hosts/organizers and roles of individuals, including the conference chair(s). Note that ISS uses the PACM HCI journal model of publishing, so Track Chairs are selected separately and are involved in the editorial process across multiple years, though we welcome suggestions.  \n\n The SC will attempt to balance the location of accepted bids to reflect the interests , diversity and geographical location of the community.  \n\n Mission Statement  \n The ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS) Steering Committee promotes and maintains the ACM ISS conference as the premiere venue for researchers and practitioners interested in the design, development and use of new and emerging tabletop, digital surface, and multi-surface technologies as well as interactive spaces.  \n   \n Contact  \n For any questions or early expressions of interest for hosting a future conference please send an email to the following address:  \n Steering Committee | (steering@iss.acm.org) \n\n Structure and People  \n   \n The steering committee (SC) consists of six (6) to eight (8) long-time ISS community members who have strong engagement with the ISS community and have been invited to serve on the committee. Members normally serve on the SC for five (5) years. The SC is lead by a Chair, who is elected by the SC. An outgoing Chair may also advise the Chair to help with knowledge transfer. The SC should represent the diversity of the ISS community.  \n Current Steering Committee Members  \n   \n  Chair  \n Mark Hancock   \n University of Waterloo  \n\n  Member  \n Craig Anslow   \n Victoria University of Wellington  \n\n  Member  \n Jessica Cauchard   \n Ben Gurion University of the Negev  \n\n  Member  \n Eve Hoggan   \n Aarhus University  \n\n  Member  \n Hideki Koike   \n Tokyo Institute of Technology  \n\n  Member  \n Bongshin Lee   \n Microsoft Research  \n\n  Member  \n Anne Roudaut   \n University of Bristol  \n\n  Member  \n Edward Tse   \n NUITEQ  \n\n   Meeting of the ISS steering committee at ACM CHI 2018 in Montreal   \n   \n Former Steering Committee Members (Alumni)  \n Raimund Dachselt | , Technische Universität Dresden \n  Miguel Nacenta | , University of Victoria \n  Johannes Schöning | , University of Bremen \n  Stacey Scott | , University of Guelph \n  Sheelagh Carpendale | , University of Calgary \n  Judy Kay | , University of Sydney \n  Sriram Subramanian | , University of Sussex \n  Andy Wilson | , Microsoft Research \n  Shahram Izadi | , PerceptiveIO Inc. \n  Gerald Morrison | , SMART Technologies UCLC \n  Chia Shen | , Harvard University \n  Bruce Thomas | , University of South Australia \n\n Tasks and Duties  \n Steering Committee Responsibilities  \n The ISS Steering committee is responsible for:  \n soliciting bids for people interested in organizing a future ISS conference and continuity of the conference, \n  making the decision on where the ISS conference is held every year, \n  providing advice to and communicating with each year's ISS conference chairs, \n  developing the spirit and general direction of ISS and specifically the financial sustainability, the publication model and diversity of the conference. \n  ensuring the highest quality for the program of the conference, \n  promoting the ISS conference series to academia, industry and the public, \n  participating in the 10-year best paper selection process, \n  interfacing to ACM SIGCHI and other HCI sister conferences. \n    \n Steering Committee Duties  \n Members of the SC are expected to attend the annual ACM ISS Steering Committee meeting during the annual conference (in person ideally but via video conference in lieu of this). In addition SC members are expected to take part in the three-monthly video conferences. A member of the SC is expected to be actively involved in the conference series which can include, attending the annual conference, submitting papers, organising workshops, running tutorials, contributing to the SC discussion and decision process and attending SC meetings.  \n\n Membership  \n How to become an ACM ISS SC member?  \n The SC will invite future members, by choosing among the past general and program chairs of the ISS conference and people involved in ACM ISS over several years. The SC is expected to have less than 8 members and more than 6. People will drop of the SC after a maximum period of 5 years. Membership of a SC member terminates when (s)he is frequently inactive. Along with participation, the SC mailing list serves as an archive of members' activities and should be reported on by the chair of the SC at the start of each annual steering committee meeting.  \n Steering Committee Chair  \n From January of 2018 the term as SC Chair lasts two years. The SC chair is chosen among members of the SC, following a vote.  \n   \n SC Decision Process  \n Any SC member can raise an issue by sending an e-mail to the list of all SC members. Every SC member must reply to the mail on the list, describing her/his position within 10 days. If no consensus is apparent, the chair calls for a formal vote (Plurality voting) by email. Every SC member must reply sending her/his vote on the list within a week. A SC member is conflicted with voting for a bid to host a conference, if the SC member is general or program chair of the proposed bid. The member can talk part in the discussion, but it not allowed to vote.  \n\n Award Process  \n 10-year Impact Award Selection Process  \n The program chairs of the current year make the selection of the TOP 3-5 papers of the conference and select the 10-years impact award. One program chair assembles the jury and starts the discussion within the jury. The jury typically consists of:  \n 1x PC chair of conference year-1 year \n  2x PC chair of conference year-10 years \n  1x SC member \n  1x ITS \"Senior member\" of the community \n\n ISS Conference Series  \n   \n ISS 2023: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, November 6-8, 2023 \n  ISS 2022: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Wellington, Aotearoa, New Zealand, November 20-23, 2022 \n  ISS 2021: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Łódź, Poland, November 14-17, 2021 \n  ISS 2020: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Lisbon, Portugal, November 8-11, 2020 \n  ISS 2019: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Daejeon, South Korea, November 10-13, 2019 \n  ISS 2018: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Tokyo, Japan, November 25-28, 2018 \n  ISS 2017: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Brighton, UK, October 17-20, 2017 \n  ISS 2016: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, November 6-9, 2016 \n  ITS 2015: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, November 15-18, 2015 \n  ITS 2014: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Dresden, Germany, November 16-19, 2014 \n  ITS 2013: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in St. Andrews, Scotland, October 6-9, 2013 \n  ITS 2012: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Cambridge, MA, USA, November 11-14, 2012 \n  ITS 2011: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Kobe, Japan, November 13-16, 2011 \n  ITS 2010: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Saarbrücken, Germany, November 7-10, 2010 \n  ITS 2009: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Banff, Canada, November 23-25, 2009 \n  TABLETOP 2008: IEEE Tabletops and Interactive Surfaces Workshop 2008   \n in Amsterdam, Netherlands, October 1-3, 2008 \n  TABLETOP 2007: 2nd IEEE Tabletop Workshop 2007   \n in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, October 10-12, 2007 \n  TABLETOP 2006: 1st IEEE Tabletop Workshop 2006   \n in Adelaide, Australia, January 5-7, 2006 \n\n iss.acm.org  ⋅ Website created by the Interactive Media Lab Dresden  and maintained by the ISS steering committee  .",

All accepted long papers will also be presented in the ACM CoNEXT 2024 conference. This is a new model that strives to combine the benefits of both conference and journal based publication. We especially encourage submissions that present novel experimentation, creative use of networking technologies, and new insights made possible using analysis. We invite submissions on a wide range of networking topics. The list of topics includes (in alphabetical order): Content distribution and caching, e.g., CDN, peer-to-peer, overlays Design, analysis, and evaluation of network architectures Energy-efficient computing and networking Experience and lessons learned by deploying large-scale networked systems In-network computing, NFV and network programmability Innovative uses of network data beyond communication Network measurements and modeling Internet economics and policy Mobile and wireless network protocols and applications Machine learning as applied to all layers of networking Networked applications including web, video, and online social networks Network aspects of datacenters, cloud computing, operating systems, virtualization Network aspects of IoT Network control and management, including SDN Network, transport, and application-layer protocols Reliability and availability of networks, protocols, and applications Reproducibility of networking research Routing and traffic engineering Security and privacy aspects of network applications and protocols We are open to other contributions that stretch networking research outside of these topics, present new emerging computing trends, or potentially involve unfamiliar techniques. We emphasize that the focus of CoNEXT is networking and its impact on networked applications. For example, papers focusing on the wireless physical layer without considering the impact on the network (e.g., quantitative performance benefits, deployment challenges) are out of scope. Potential authors who are unsure of the scope are encouraged to contact the PC chairs before submission. The CoNEXT conference will present all papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Networking (PAMCNET), as well as short papers submitted to the conference. There are two deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below).

MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications. MobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand, the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. MobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments. MobiCom 2025 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 as described below in more detail. Topics We invite submissions on a wide range of mobile computing, mobile systems, mobile applications, and wireless networking research, including but not limited to the following: Edge and cloud computing Embedded and energy-harvesting systems Backscatter communication and wireless power Implantable and wearable computing Millimeter-wave and terahertz communications Mobile health Applications of machine learning (on-device ML, federated/decentralized ML) to mobile/wireless research Transfer learning and domain adaptation for mobile applications Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI for mobile and wireless systems Next generation of mobile networks (5G, 6G and beyond) Mobile web, video, virtual reality, augmented reality and other applications Novel applications of wireless signals Practical quantum applications and systems (quantum sensing, quantum programming, quantum machine learning, etc.) Vehicular, robotic and drone-based networking Communication with reconfigurable and intelligent reflective surfaces, meta materials, and flexible surfaces Satellite networks and integrated satellite-terrestrial networks Security and privacy issues/solutions for mobile/wireless systems Sensing with radio, light, sound, and acoustics Smart cities and smart spaces (e.g. smart factories, smart workspace, smart agriculture, urban mobility) Ubiquitous computing

While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.  \n   The conference was held in this new merged format for the very first time from September 8-12, 2013  , in Zurich, Switzerland.  \n The UbiComp 2013 Proceedings  are available via the ACM Digital Library (ISBN 978-1-4503-1770-2).  \n By offering a single venue for the leading worldwide research in Pervasive and Ubiquitous computing, the new format is meant to better serve the needs of the research community by attracting more attendees (including the leading Pervasive/UbiComp researchers worldwide), and enabling more satellite events. UbiComp 2013 was multi-track and featured a program  of 92 scientific paper presentations (acceptance rate 23.4%)  . Topics included any work that one would previously expect to find at either UbiComp or Pervasive.  \n Following several successful collaborations as part of the Pervasive conference series, UbiComp 2013 continued the tradition of collocating with ISWC 2013  .  \n The adjunct program  is available at www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2013/adjunct/starthere.htm  .

Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  \n Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  \n Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  \n Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  \n Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  \n Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  \n Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  \n Tracks   \n This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   \n HOW TO SUBMIT   \n At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  \n https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   \n Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  \n Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  \n In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  \n Double-Anonymous Review Process   \n In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  \n Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. \n  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. \n  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. \n  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. \n  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. \n  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. \n  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . \n  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  \n To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  \n Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  \n Submission Policies   \n The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  \n “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” \n  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” \n  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  \n Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  \n To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  \n All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  \n Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  \n Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.  \n Important Dates   \n All dates are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12h)  \n Paper registration: | September 5, 2024 | (to register a paper, paper title, abstract, author list, and some additional metadata are required; title and abstract | must | contain sufficient information for effective bidding; registrations containing empty or generic title and abstract may be dropped) \n  Full paper submission: | September 12, 2024 \n  Author response: | November 22-26, 2024 \n  Initial notification: January 14, 2024 (long discussion period due to year-end holidays) \n  Revised manuscript submissions (major revisions only): February 25, 2025 \n  Final notification for major revisions: April 1, 2025 \n  Camera ready: April 24, 2025 \n  The official publication date is the date the journal issue is made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be as early as July 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. Please also note that the names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  \n Open Science Policy   \n The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  \n Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  \n Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.  \n Topics of Interest   \n Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  \n Artificial intelligence and machine learning for software engineering \n  Autonomic computing \n  Debugging and fault localization \n  Dependability, safety, and reliability \n  Distributed and collaborative software engineering \n  Embedded software, safety-critical systems, and cyber-physical systems \n  Empirical software engineering \n  Human and social aspects of software engineering \n  Human-computer interaction \n  Mining software repositories \n  Mobile development \n  Model checking \n  Model-driven engineering \n  Parallel, distributed, and concurrent systems \n  Performance engineering \n  Program analysis \n  Program comprehension \n  Program repair \n  Program synthesis \n  Programming languages \n  Recommendation systems \n  Requirements engineering \n  Search-based software engineering \n  Services, components, and cloud \n  Software architectures \n  Software engineering education \n  Software engineering for machine learning and artificial intelligence \n  Software evolution \n  Software processes \n  Software security \n  Software testing \n  Software traceability \n  Symbolic execution \n  Tools and environments \n\n FAQ  \n   \n FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   \n PACMSE Proceedings   \n Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   \n A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  \n Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   \n A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  \n Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  \n Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  \n Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  \n Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  \n Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   \n Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   \n A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  \n Major Revision Process   \n Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   \n A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  \n For Authors   \n Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   \n A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  \n Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   \n A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  \n For Reviewers   \n Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   \n A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  \n Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   \n A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  \n Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   \n A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  \n Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   \n A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  \n Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  \n Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   \n A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  \n Review Process   \n For Authors   \n Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   \n A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  \n Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   \n A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  \n For Reviewers   \n Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   \n A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  \n Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   \n A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  \n Open Science Policy   \n Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  \n A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  \n make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or \n  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and \n  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? \n  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  \n Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   \n Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   \n A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  \n Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   \n A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  \n For Authors   \n Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   \n A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  \n Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   \n A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  \n Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   \n A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  \n Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  \n Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   \n A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  \n Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   \n A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  \n Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   \n A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  \n Things you may do:  \n Put your submission on your home page. \n  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. \n  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. \n  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. \n  Things you should not do:  \n Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. \n  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). \n  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. \n  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  \n Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   \n A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  \n For Reviewers   \n Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  \n Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   \n A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  \n Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   \n A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  \n The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.  \n\n Important Dates   AoE (UTC-12h)     \n\n Tue 14 Jan 2025  \n  Initial notification \n Tue 11 Feb 2025  \n  Camera ready (directly accepted paper) \n Tue 25 Feb 2025  \n  Submission for major-revision papers \n Tue 1 Apr 2025  \n  Final notification for major revisions \n Thu 24 Apr 2025  \n  Camera ready (major revisions) \n Fri 22 - Tue 26 Nov 2024   \n  Author response \n Thu 12 Sep 2024   \n  Full paper submission \n Thu 5 Sep 2024   \n  Paper registration \n\n Submission Link   \n   \n   https://fse2025.hotcrp.com     \n   \n Program Committee    \n   \n Denys Poshyvanyk Program Co-Chair    \n William & Mary   \n United States \n  Dongmei Zhang Program Co-Chair    \n Microsoft Research   \n China \n  Iftekhar Ahmed    \n University of California at Irvine   \n United States \n  Dalal Alrajeh    \n Imperial College London   \n United Kingdom \n  Wesley Assunção    \n North Carolina State University   \n United States \n  Hamid Bagheri    \n University of Nebraska-Lincoln   \n United States \n  Guangdong Bai    \n University of Queensland   \n Australia \n  Luciano Baresi    \n Politecnico di Milano   \n Italy \n  Alexandre Bartel    \n Umeå University   \n Sweden \n  Gabriele Bavota    \n Software Institute @ Università della Svizzera Italiana   \n Switzerland \n  Dirk Beyer    \n LMU Munich   \n Germany \n  Domenico Bianculli    \n University of Luxembourg   \n Luxembourg \n  Amiangshu Bosu    \n Wayne State University   \n United States \n  Víctor Braberman    \n ICC (UBA-CONICET)   \n Argentina \n  John Businge    \n University of Nevada, Las Vegas   \n United States \n  Joanna C.

The 18th ACM International WSDM Conference will take place in Hannover, Germany (in-person conference) between March 10th to 14th, 2025.  \n The Industry Day event will take place on the first day of the WSDM conference, Monday, March 10th, 2025.  \n The WSDM Industry Chairs are inviting submissions for technical talks that cover the usage of web search and data mining in an industrial setting. The talks may address challenges, solutions, and case studies of interesting and innovative systems as well as applied research in relevant areas. The theme this year is: Large Language Models in Industrial Settings. Particular consideration will be given to talk proposals that are relevant to the theme.  \n Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  \n Challenges, applications, and foundational advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for industrial applications \n  User behavior patterns and insights as demonstrated in large-scale web search and data mining applications \n  Building and optimizing modeling pipelines for high throughput and low latency production systems to deliver business impact. \n  Case studies addressing practical challenges such as data, privacy, ethics, integrity, scale, and regulation. \n\n Submission Guidelines  \n\n Presentation proposals should be 1 to 2 pages (including references) and follow the ACM format. Formatting guidelines are available at this ACM publication site  (use the ˮsigconf” proceedings template, two-column format).  \n Please include:  \n Title \n  Abstract \n  Outline of the presentation \n  A brief company portrait (~60 words) \n  A short bio of the main presenter (~100 words) \n  WSDM is a technical conference, so preference will be given to talks describing novel applications of existing or new research in industrial settings, and technical challenges in applying novel research at industrial scale. Please do NOT submit a sales speech or a product description that does not contain any novel research, novel application of existing research, and novel insights into solving challenging problems at industrial scale!  \n Proposals should be submitted electronically via Easychair: https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=wsdmindustrytrack202   \n\n Presentation and Publication  \n\n The presentation format will be decided based on submissions and interest to the wider community, and is likely to be a mix of short and long presentations as well as panels.   \n WSDM 2025 is an in-person conference. At least one author of each accepted presentation needs to register and present the work at the WSDM 2025 Industry Day. All talks should be delivered in person.   \n The authors of accepted proposals will be invited to submit a camera-ready copy to be included in the proceedings.   \n\n © 2024, WSDM 2025.

The format is derived from the ACM template's sample-sigconf.tex file, and is used with an objective of keeping the submission version similar to the camera ready version. In an effort to respect the efforts of reviewers and in the interest of fairness to all prospective authors, we request that all submissions to ISCA 2025 follow the formatting and submission rules detailed below. Submissions that violate these instructions may not be reviewed, at the discretion of the program chairs, in order to maintain a review process that is fair to all potential authors.  \n\n  Paper Evaluation Objectives  \n The committee will make every effort to judge each submitted paper on its own merits. There will be no target acceptance rate. We expect to accept a wide range of papers with appropriate expectations for evaluation – while papers that build on significant past work with strong evaluations are valuable, papers that open new areas with less rigorous evaluation are equally welcome and especially encouraged. We also acknowledge the wide range of evaluation methodologies in ISCA including modeling, simulation, prototyping, experimental implementation, real product evaluation, etc.  \n\n  Paper Formatting  \n Papers must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain a maximum of 11 pages  of single-spaced two-column text, not including references  . You may include any number of pages for references, but see below for more instructions. If you are using LaTeX to typeset your paper, then we suggest that you use the ISCA 2025 ACM template  . The sample paper  was prepared with that template. The general ACM templates (Latex, Microsoft Word or Overleaf) can be accessed here  .  \n Please ensure that you include page numbers with your submission.  This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different parts of your paper when they provide comments. Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the title page, which contains the submission number and the notice of confidentiality.  \n\n  View Sample Paper    \n\n Field | Value \n Page Limit | 11 pages, not including references \n File Format | PDF \n Paper Size | US Letter: 8.5in x 11in \n References | no page limit, list all authors' names \n\n  Content  \n Reviewing will be double blind  : please do not include any author names on any submitted documents except in the space provided on the submission form. You must also ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the authors. If you are improving upon your prior work, refer to your prior work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography. For example, if you are building on your own  prior work in the papers, you would say something like: “While the authors of [x][y] did X, Y, and Z, this paper additionally does W and is therefore much better.” Do NOT omit or anonymize references for blind review. There is one exception to this for your own prior work that appeared in IEEE CAL, arXiv, workshops without archived proceedings, etc., as discussed later in this document.  \n Figures and Tables  \n Ensure that the figures and tables are legible. Please also ensure that you refer to your figures in the main text. Many reviewers print the papers in gray-scale. Therefore, if you use colors for your figures, ensure that the different colors are highly distinguishable in grayscale.  \n References  \n There is no length limit for references. Each reference must explicitly list all authors of the paper. Papers not meeting this requirement will be rejected. Authors of NSF proposals should be familiar with this requirement. Knowing all authors of related work will help find the best reviewers. Since there is no length limit for the number of pages used for references, there is no need to save space here.  \n\n  Paper Submission Instructions  \n Guidelines for Determining Authorship  \n ACM guidelines dictate that authorship should be based on a substantial intellectual contribution.  It is assumed that all authors have had a significant role in the creation of an article that bears their names. In particular, the authorship credit must be reserved only for individuals who have met each of the following conditions:  \n Made a significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical development, system or experimental design, prototype development, and/or the analysis and interpretation of data associated with the work contained in the article; \n  Contributed to drafting the article or reviewing and/or revising it for intellectual content; and \n  Approved the final version of the article as accepted for publication, including references. \n  A detailed description of the ACM authorship guidelines and responsibilities is available here  . Per these guidelines, it is not acceptable to award honorary authorship or gift authorship. Please keep these guidelines in mind while determining the author list of your paper.  \n Declaring Authors  \n Declare all the authors of the paper upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the paper is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment.  \n Areas and Topics  \n Authors should indicate these areas on the submission form as well as specific topics covered by the paper for optimal reviewer match. If you are unsure whether your paper falls within the scope of ISCA, please check with the program chairs – ISCA is a broad multidisciplinary conference and encourages new topics.  \n Declaring Conflicts of Interest  \n Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected.  \n Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper. A conflict occurs in the following cases:  \n Between advisors and advisees, forever. \n  Between family members, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). \n  Between people who have collaborated in the last FIVE years. This collaboration can consist of a joint research or development project, a joint paper, or when there is direct funding from the potential reviewer (as opposed to company funding) to an author of the paper. Co-participation in professional activities, such as tutorials or studies, is not cause for conflict. When in doubt, the author should check with the | program chairs | . \n  Between people from the same institution or who were in the same institution in the last FIVE years. \n  Between people whose relationship prevents the reviewer from being objective in his/her assessment. \n  \"Service\" collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects.  \n On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration which has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The program chairs may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.  \n Most reviews will be solicited among the members of the program committee and the external review committee but other members from the community may also write reviews. Please declare all your conflicts (not just restricted to the PC and ERC)  on the submission form. When in doubt, contact the program chairs.  \n Concurrent Submissions and Workshops  \n By submitting a manuscript to ISCA 2025, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference journal, or the archived proceedings of a workshop (e.g., in the ACM/IEEE digital library) – see exceptions below. The authors also guarantee that no paper that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper will be under review for any other conference or journal or an archived proceedings of a workshop during the ISCA 2025 review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection.  \n The only exceptions to the above rules are for the authors' own papers in (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM/IEEE digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL or arXiv where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. In all such cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the above work to preserve author anonymity. This information must, however, be provided on the submission form – the PC chair will make this information available to reviewers if it becomes necessary to ensure a fair review. If you have already put your manuscript on arXiv, in the interest of double blind review, modify the title for the version you submit to ISCA. As always, if you are in doubt, it is best to contact the program chairs  .  \n Finally, the ACM Plagiarism Policy  and the IEEE Plagiarism Policy  cover a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one's own work.  \n\n  Additional Rules for Authors  \n Authors MUST:  \n Abide by the ACM code of ethics and the IEEE code of ethics. \n  Abide by the criterion for authorship laid out by ACM and IEEE. Authorship is reserved only for individuals making substantial intellectual contributions. Gifting authorship is strictly prohibited. \n  List all legitimate CoIs and only legitimate CoIs. Asking someone for feedback on a draft of the paper or discussing the idea with someone does not create a CoI. \n  Abide by the Concurrent Submission Policy (see above). \n  Anonymize their submission for double-anonymous reviewing. This means not having any author names on any submitted documents, including in PDF metadata, except in the space provided on the submission form. If referring to one’s work, authors must do so in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography. References must not be omitted or anonymized. \n  Fully anonymize any link to artifacts produced by them concerning the submission (e.g., GitHub repository). Remove any links to artifacts that cannot be fully anonymized. \n  Report any allegations of submission or reviewing misconduct to the Program Chairs, who has the responsibility to follow up on them. The only exception is if the complaint is about the Program Chairs; in this case, the Steering Committee should be contacted. \n  Make no assumptions as to whether a particular paper represents a “community paper” and whether its co-authors are or are not conflicted with each other. The decision rests entirely with the Program Chairs, who must be either petitioned explicitly or will be presented with the choice through a conflict-tracking tool. A community paper is defined as a paper presenting a survey, compendium, tool, or artifact to which multiple authors contribute without engaging in an actual project collaboration (e.g., a paper describing an open-source software framework to which the authors have contributed different modules). \n  Authors MUST NOT:  \n Contact reviewers or PC members about any submission, including their own. This includes asking about the outcome of a submission following the online discussion period and the PC meeting. Similarly, authors are not allowed to ask another party to contact the reviewers on their behalf. \n  List potential reviewers as conflicts of interest based solely on fear or suspicion of a negative bias. If an author believes there exists clear and articulable evidence of a negative bias against their work from a potential reviewer, the author may contact the Program Chairs and present such evidence in support of their case. The Program Chairs must acknowledge receipt and may solicit additional information. The Program Chairs are not required to notify the authors of any decision taken. \n  Attempt to sway a reviewer to review any paper positively or negatively. \n  Contact reviewers or PC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted papers. \n  Disclose the content of reviews for one’s paper publicly before the results are announced. Any grievances should be directed to the Program Chairs. \n\n  Acknowledgments  \n This document is derived from previous conferences, in particular ISCA 2024.  \n\n  © International Symposium on Computer Architecture   \n IEEE Privacy Policy",

I.e. a paper rejected at Round 4 of SIGMOD 2024 can only be resubmitted to Round 4 of SIGMOD 2025. A paper rejected at Round 2 can be resubmited to Round 2, 3, and 4 of SIGMOD 2025. \n  ORCIDs: | ORCIDs are required for all authors at the time of abstract submission. See | Submission Guidelines | . \n  Abstract, COIs and Paper Submission Dates: | Abstracts and COIs are submitted a week ahead of the main paper submission on Jan 10, Apr 10, Jul 10 or Oct 10. See | Dates | . \n  No Special Tracks: | Previous data-intensive and data science applications tracks are now folded into the main research track, although they retain unique criteria. See | Topics | . \n  No Author Feedback Phase: | There will be no author feedback phase this year. See | Review Process | . \n  Shepherding in place of Revision Requirements: | Initial feedback from reviews will be an unambiguous Accept or Reject. Accepted papers may have revision requirements from the reviews; a shepherd will assist authors of accepted papers in meeting these requirements. See | Review Process | . \n  Posters and Random Selection for Presentation: | Every accepted paper will be allocated a poster presentation slot. However, due to ever-increasing numbers of accepted papers, there will not be a speaking slot for each accepted paper in 2025.

All papers are strongly encouraged to present a poster at these plenaries.  \n The number of SIGMOD submissions has been growing steadily over many years. To accommodate publication growth while maintaining an engaging and communal in-person conference, SIGMOD 2025 will randomly  select a subset of accepted papers for presentation at the conference. Authors of randomly selected papers will be invited to present their paper in a speaking slot at the conference.  \n A random sample of papers ensures a fair selection process, reflects the main themes of the pool of accepted papers, and maintains the principle that all papers regardless of presentation selection are of full SIGMOD quality.  \n REVIEW PROCESS  \n Each submission will receive three  reviews.  \n  In response to community feedback, there will be no  author feedback this year. Moreover, unlike past years, all papers will receive an initial Accept or Reject decision upon completion of reviews. In lieu of the revision requests from prior years, many accepted papers will be assigned a shepherd  to guide authors through revisions. Final acceptance is contingent upon satisfying shepherding requests.  \n   \n Timeline   \n These are rough timelines that are subject to change.  \n Submission to Notification is 6 weeks   \n  \n Week |  \n 0 | Abstract Bidding & Reviewer Assignment \n 1 | Submission and Review \n 2 | Review \n 3 | Review \n 4 | Discussion \n 5 | Discussion \n 6 | Discussion, Shepherd Selection (for all accepted papers; usually main champion) \n\n Notification to Final Submission is 9 weeks   \n  Rejected papers cannot be submitted to SIGMOD until a full year has passed.  \n\n Week |  \n 1 | Authors create and submit revision plan \n 2 | Shepherd reviews plan and submits feedback \n 3 | Shepherd reviews plan and submits feedback \n 4-8 | Authors revise and resubmit \n 9 | Shepherd, AE, Reviewers make final acceptance/rejection decision \n\n Common revision requests can include  \n justify a crucial assumption, \n  improve motivation of the potential benefits of the work, \n  clean up notation, tighten presentation, \n  compare against specific relevant prior work, \n  show experimental results with better data, such as at larger scale or with richer statistical properties. \n   \n Revision requests must be reasonably achievable in time for resubmission, and will not be requested to address lack of technical depth or novelty or where the revised paper will address a substantially different problem from the original.  \n One extra content page is allowed to accommodate the requested revision items. The revised submission should include a cover letter (up to 4 pages) to summarize how the authors have addressed the requested revisions.  \n In addition to the revised submission and cover letter, authors are encouraged to include a visual diff of the original and revised versions (e.g. via latexdiff or word processing tools that Track Changes).  \n SUBMISSION GUIDELINES  \n\n Submission Link | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2025 \n Submission Paper length | 12 pages excluding references \n Appendix | No Appendix \n Camera Ready Paper length | 13 pages excluding references, no appendix \n File type and size | PDF (<= 10 MB) \n Paper size | Letter (8.5” x 11”) \n Format | 2-column ACM Proceedings format: Latex: | sample-sigconf.tex (version 2e) \n  Word: | Interim layout.docx \n  Overleaf: | ACM’s official 2-column template \n Anonymity | Double-anonymity (see below) \n\n No changes to author lists are allowed after submission. \n  No changes to title are allowed after submission except by AE request. \n  Accepted papers will need to be ported to the PACMMOD format for final publication. Do not use PACMMOD format for submission or review. \n   \n Declaring Conflicts of Interest (COI)   \n   \n Each author | is responsible for entering their | ORCID | , own individual domain and PC conflicts on CMT. You can mark your conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting ''Domain Conflicts'' and ''Individual Conflicts''. We expect authors to have a single unique ORCID: the one used at submission will be used for publication. \n  An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions. \n  Conflicts are | not | declared per submission. \n  Conflict declaration must occur prior to paper submission. \n   \n It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members.  \n Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  \n Definition of Conflict of Interest   \n  A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of the following conditions holds:  \n The PC member is a co-author of the paper. \n  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past five years. | 1 \n  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past five years. | 2 \n  The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. \n  The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. \n  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. \n   \n 1  Short-term associations, such as summer internships do not constitute institutional COIs. E.g., a student who interned at Microsoft should declare as conflicts any individuals in the group they worked with and other collaborators on their projects, but they should not declare a domain conflict with microsoft.com.  \n 2  Collaborations are indicated by prior co-authorships, shared grant funding, and close research relationships, even if those have not yet resulted in common publications. Publications (typically with a large set of authors) that fall outside the traditional sense of research collaborations (e.g., “The Seattle Report on Database Research”, “ Diversity and Inclusion Activities in Database Conferences: A 2021 Report”, etc.) do not in themselves constitute a COI.  \n To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members may be asked to confirm declared conflicts with submitting authors.  \n Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirement   \n  Following the ACM guidelines  a research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 cannot be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for SIGMOD. Furthermore, after you submit a research paper to SIGMOD, you must await the response from SIGMOD and only re-submit elsewhere if your paper is rejected — or withdrawn at your request — from SIGMOD. This restriction applies not only to identical papers but also to papers with a substantial overlap in scientific content and results.  \n To enforce this requirement, the high-level metadata of submissions (title, abstract, list of authors), may be shared with the Program Chairs / Editors of other conferences and journals.  \n Every research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 must present substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. In this context, a prior publication is (a) a paper of five pages or more, presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If a SIGMOD 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication (respecting the double anonymity requirement), and clearly indicate which parts of the work appeared in prior publications and which parts are novel to the current submission.  \n Any violation of this policy will result in the immediate rejection of the submission, as well as in notification to the members of the SIGMOD Executive Committee, the members of the SIGMOD PC, and the editors or chairs of any other forums involved.   \n Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   \n  As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  \n Inclusion and Diversity in Writing   \n  We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and professions. Both are important in our writing as well. Diversity of representation in writing is a simple but visible avenue to celebrate and ultimately help improve our community's diversity. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Be vigilant and guard against unintentionally exclusionary examples.  \n Please visit this page for many examples of both exclusionary writing to avoid and inclusive writing that celebrates diversity to consider adopting: https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html  .  \n Authors are further encouraged to follow the tips and guidelines provided at: https://dbdni.github.io/#materials  .  \n Reviewers will be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise. Going further, also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in writing.  \n Please see https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter  for inclusive alternatives for some of the terms commonly used in the computing profession.  \n Policy on Authorship Requirements   \n  We follow the ACM policy on authorship requirements  . Specifically on the use of generative AI tools and technologies, the guidelines note that: \"Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.\"  \n Anonymity Requirements for all submissions   \n  Research track submissions are subject to the double-anonymity requirement.  \n Every research track paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 will undergo a double-anonymous reviewing process, following the three principles put forward in | (Snodgrass 2007) | : authors should not be required to go to great lengths to anonymize their submissions; comprehensiveness of the review trumps anonymizing efficacy. AEs retain flexibility and authority in managing the reviewing process. \n  PC members and referees, except the Associate Editors, who review the submission will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship from the PC members and referees, authors must at least do the following: Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the submission. \n  Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. \n  Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. \n  The paper’s file name must not identify the authors of the submission. \n  Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors' names in the submission's associated metadata. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file. \n   \n To avoid compromising the double-anonymity requirement, we request that the authors refrain from publicizing and uploading versions of their submitted manuscripts to pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, and other online forums during the reviewing period. If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to SIGMOD.  \n You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:  \n In our previous work [1, 2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, \"A Simple Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10. [2] Jane Smith, \"A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.   \n The solution is to reference one's past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity:  \n In previous work [1, 2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, \"A Simple Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10. [2] Jane Smith, \"A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.   \n Despite the anonymity requirements, you should still include all relevant work of your own in the references, using the above style; omitting them could potentially reveal your identity by negation. However, self-references should be limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced.  \n Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. The goal is to preserve anonymity while still allowing the reader to fully grasp the context (related past work, including your own) of the submitted paper. In past years, this goal has been achieved successfully by thousands of papers.  \n It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.  \n No exceptions will be made to the double anonymity requirement for Research Track papers. If the authors of a submission feel that double anonymity needs to be violated, for example to reveal the identity of a system, they may consider submission to a SIGMOD track that does not impose a double anonymity requirement, such as the Industry Track.  \n Artifacts and Reproducibility   \n  SIGMOD strives to establish a culture where sharing research artifacts (data, results, code, and scripts) is the norm rather than an exception. SIGMOD reproducibility has three goals: (a) Highlighting the impact of database research papers; (b) enabling easy dissemination of research results; and (c) enabling easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In this context, we expect all papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available if this is possible. Although it is not mandatory for acceptance, providing this extra material can help reviewers evaluate your work more thoroughly. Papers published at SIGMOD which have been successfully reproduced are also recognized and highlighted as such in the ACM Digital Library.  \n Please include a link with your materials in the text box provided in the submission form at the time of submission. For all Research Track submissions, the link and materials should preserve anonymity. For example this may be an anonymous GitHub repository. You may want to make sure that the link you provide is not indexed by search engines. On GitHub, you can do so by adding the following to the page head:  \n <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">   \n We recognize that at the time of submission authors focus on fine-tuning the paper, and so we expect this link to be live within one week from submission. Reviewers that may need to look at the materials will not do so earlier than that. We do not expect a fully polished submission in terms of automatically reproducing results, but rather a reasonably clean version of the state of the code when submitting the paper. Please, do not use a shortened link which traces who accesses it.  \n In the event that you are not able to submit your code, data, scripts, and notebooks please explain in the text box provided in the submission form why this is the case.",

Researchers and developers in these areas are addressing many similar problems but with different backgrounds and approaches. LCTES is intended to expose researchers and developers from either area to relevant work and interesting problems in the other area and provide a forum where they can interact.  \n LCTES’23 is co-located with PLDI  and FCRC 2023  , sharing the venue and activities with ten top computer science conferences.  \n Proceedings   \n The proceedings for LCTES 2023 are now available in the ACM Digital Library  .  \n Attendance policy   \n Accepted papers must be presented at LCTES 2023 to appear in the proceedings. Since FCRC is an in-person conference, presentations must be in person and the presenter must register for LCTES. Under special circumstances, pre-recorded presentations are allowed but require three virtual PLDI registrations to help us cover the cost of the proceedings. If you are unable to present your paper in person, contact the general chair  as soon as possible.  \n Registration is open   \n Registrations are now open  . Access to LCTES is possible with a 2-day or single-day (Sunday) pass as part of PLDI. Make sure to tick the “LCTES” box when signing up!  \n Accommodation   \n Visit the FCRC 2023 hotel information  page to book your rooms at a discounted rate.  \n Conference attendance grants for student authors   \n If you are a student and a presenter or co-author of a paper but need money to attend the conference, you can apply for a SIGPLAN grant.

Embedded systems are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore, they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these issues, such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints.  \n The 24th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2023) solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted to https://lctes23.hotcrp.com/  .  \n\n Important Dates   \n Paper submission deadline: March 24, 2023 (extended firm deadline) \n  Paper notification: April 24, 2023 \n  AE submission deadline: May 1, 2023 \n  AE notification: May 12, 2023 \n  Camera-ready deadline: May 15, 2023 \n  Conference: June 18, 2023 \n\n Paper Categories   \n Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work. \n  Work-in-progress paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions. \n  Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, this year’s LCTES introduces two journal modes.  \n All accepted full papers will be invited to be published in a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS). A TECS publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process. \n  Rejected full papers may have the option to submit their work to the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL; 4 pages). IEEE ESL submissions will undergo a separate review process. \n\n Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest including, but not limited to:   \n Programming language challenges   \n Domain-specific languages \n  Features to exploit multicore, reconfigurable, and other emerging architectures \n  Features for distributed, adaptive, and real-time control embedded systems \n  Capabilities for specification, composition, and construction of embedded systems \n  Language features and techniques to enhance reliability, verifiability, and security \n  Virtual machines, concurrency, inter-processor synchronization, and memory management \n  Compiler challenges   \n Interaction between embedded architectures, operating systems, and compilers \n  Interpreters, binary translation, just-in-time compilation, and split compilation \n  Support for enhanced programmer productivity \n  Support for enhanced debugging, profiling, and exception/interrupt handling \n  Optimization for low power/energy, code/data size, and real-time performance \n  Parameterized and structural compiler design space exploration and auto-tuning \n  Tools for analysis, specification, design, and implementation, including: \n  Hardware, system software, application software, and their interfaces \n  Distributed real-time control, media players, and reconfigurable architectures \n  System integration and testing \n  Performance estimation, monitoring, and tuning \n  Run-time system support for embedded systems \n  Design space exploration tools \n  Support for system security and system-level reliability \n  Approaches for cross-layer system optimization \n  Theory and foundations of embedded systems   \n Predictability of resource behavior: energy, space, time \n  Validation and verification, in particular of concurrent and distributed systems \n  Formal foundations of model-based design as the basis for code generation, analysis, and verification \n  Mathematical foundations for embedded systems \n  Models of computations for embedded applications \n  Novel embedded architectures   \n Design and implementation of novel architectures \n  Workload analysis and performance evaluation \n  Architecture support for new language features, virtualization, compiler techniques, debugging tools \n  Architectural features to improve power/energy, code/data size, and predictability \n  Mobile systems and IoT   \n Operating systems for mobile and IoT devices \n  Compiler and software tools for mobile and IoT systems \n  Energy management for mobile and IoT devices \n  Memory and IO techniques for mobile and IoT devices \n\n ACM Publications Policies   \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start, and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n\n Authors take note   \n The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n\n Submission  \n  \n  Submissions must be in ACM SIGPLAN subformat of the acmart format (available at and explained in more detail at https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/  ). Each paper should be in 10pt font and have no more than 10 pages for full papers  or 4 pages for work-in-progress papers  , excluding the bibliography. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al.  ). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Submissions must be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4-sized paper. For papers in the work-in-progress category, add the suffix “(WIP)” to your title, such as “Title (WIP)”  .  \n To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules:  \n author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, \n  references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). \n  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here  . Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.  \n\n ACM Publications Policies   \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .

Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This submission is voluntary but strongly encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.  \n At LCTES, we follow ACM’s artifact review and badging policy, version 1.1  . ACM describes a research artifact as follows:  \n By “artifact” we mean a digital object created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results.  \n  \n Submission of an artifact does not imply automatic permission to make its content public. AEC members will be instructed that they may not publicize any part of the submitted artifacts during or after completing the evaluation, and they will not retain any part of any artifact after evaluation. Thus, you can include models, data files, proprietary binaries, and similar items in your artifact.  \n We expect each artifact to receive three reviews. Papers that pass the Artifact Evaluation process will receive up to three ACM artifact evaluation badge(s) directly printed on the paper and available as meta information in the ACM Digital Library.  \n Artifact evaluation is single-blind. Please take precautions (e.g., turning off analytics and logging) to help prevent accidentally learning the reviewers’ identities.  \n Badging   \n The papers with accepted artifacts will be assigned official ACM artifact evaluation badges based on the criteria defined by ACM  . The AEC awards up to three types of badges that reflect the evaluation (red), availability (green), and validation (blue) of the artifact and the results of the paper. Refer to the ACM website  for detailed badge information. Note that artifacts will be evaluated with respect to the claims and presentation in the submitted version of the paper, not the camera-ready version   .  \n The awarded badges will appear on the first page of the camera-ready version of the paper. Artifact authors will be allowed to revise their camera-ready paper after being notified of their artifact’s publication to include a link to the artifact’s DOI.  \n Note that we only award the “Reproducibility” (dark blue) badge but not the “Replication” (light blue) one.  \n Guidelines   \n Carefully think which badge(s) you seek to receive | . | If your only goal is to publish your code, seek the “Availability” (green) badge. The reviewers will not exercise the artifact for its functionality or validate the paper’s claims. \n  If you wish you have your results reproduced without making your artifact documented, consistent, complete, and exercisable, seek the “Reproducibility” (blue) badge rather than the “Functionality/Reusability” (red) badge. \n  If you do not want to make the artifact available publicly, do not seek the “Availability” (green) badge. \n  Minimize the artifact setup overhead | . | A well-packaged artifact is easily usable by the reviewers and conveys the value of your work. A great way to package an artifact is as a VM image or Docker container that runs “out of the box.” We encourage authors to include pre-built binaries along with the source and build scripts that allow the AEC to regenerate the binaries to guarantee maximum transparency. Pre-built VM or docker images are preferred over scripts that build the image since this alleviates reliance on external dependencies. Make sure to test your artifact on at least one machine different than the one you used to prepare the artifact to identify missing dependencies. \n  Giving AE reviewers remote access to your machines with preinstalled (proprietary) software is possible. \n  Preparing the Artifact   \n You should make your artifact available as a single archive file and use the naming convention <paper #>.<suffix>  , where the appropriate suffix is used for the given archive format. Use a commonly-available compressed archive format such as .tgz, .tbz2, or .zip and open document formats. The link to download your artifact must protect the anonymity of the reviewers (e.g., a Google Drive URL).  \n The compressed archive should consist of three pieces:  \n The submission version of your accepted paper. \n  A | README | file (PDF or plaintext format) that explains your artifact (details below). \n  A folder containing the artifact. \n  The README.txt  should consist of two parts:  \n a | Getting Started Guide | and \n  Step-by-Step Instructions | that detail how your artifact can be evaluated. Include appropriate references to the relevant sections of your paper. \n  The Getting Started Guide  should contain instructions on how to set up (including, for example, a pointer to the VM player software, its version, and passwords if needed) and test your artifact. Anyone following this guide should be able to handle the rest of your artifact easily.  \n The Step by Step Instructions  explain how to reproduce experiments or other activities supporting your paper’s conclusions. Write this for readers who are deeply interested in your work and are studying to improve or compare against it. If your artifact runs for more than a few minutes, point this out and explain how to run it on smaller inputs.  \n Where appropriate, include descriptions of and links to files (included in the archive) that represent the expected outputs   such as log files generated by your tool for a given set of inputs. If there are warnings that can be ignored, explain what they are.  \n Further, include the following:  \n A list of claims from the paper supported by the artifact. Explain how and why the artifact supports those claims. \n  A list of claims from the paper | not | supported by the artifact. Explain why the artifact does not support those claims. Examples: performance claims cannot be reproduced in a VM, authors cannot redistribute specific benchmarks, etc. \n  When preparing your artifact, please keep in mind:  \n How accessible you are making your artifact to other researchers. \n  The AEC members will have a limited time to assess your artifact. \n  Artifact Evaluation Committee   \n Other than the chair, the AEC members are senior graduate students, postdocs, or recent Ph.D. graduates, identified with the help of the LCTES PC and recent artifact evaluation committees. Please check SIGPLAN’s Empirical Evaluation Guidelines  for some methodologies to consider during evaluation.  \n Throughout the review period, reviews will be submitted to HotCRP and continuously visible to authors. AEC reviewers will be able to continuously interact (anonymously) with authors for clarifications, system-specific patches, and other logistics to help ensure that the artifact can be evaluated. Continuous interaction prevents rejecting artifacts for “wrong library version” types of problems.  \n Our goal is that all submitted artifacts successfully pass the artifact evaluation.   \n\n Speaker's Guide  \n   \n LCTES’23 Speaker’s Guide   \n This document is for those presenting a paper at LCTES’23. If you’re presenting at ISMM, PLDI, or a PLDI tutorial or workshop, please see the Speaker’s Guide on the page for the corresponding conference/track.  \n Congratulations on having your paper accepted at LCTES’23! This document will help ensure your presentation runs smoothly and has the best possible audience impact. Please read it in its entirety.  \n Checklist   \n Before LCTES:  \n Prepare and | practice | . \n  Ensure your talk runs for | no more than 15 minutes | . \n  Sign up for Discord | ( | details here | ). \n  Upload a backup copy of your talk slides | (details below). \n  Check the program | to establish when and where your talk will be. \n  Ensure you have a | HDMI adaptor | for your device. \n  Before your talk:  \n Familiarize yourself with the room | you will be speaking in. \n  Find and | introduce yourself to your session chair | . \n  Find the Discord channel | for your session, so you can monitor questions. \n  Attend the mandatory video check | before your session (details below). \n  Ensure that you are in the room no later than 5 minutes before your session. \n  After your talk:  \n Expect | questions from the floor | and session chair. \n  Once you’ve completed your talk and Q&A, | monitor Discord for follow-up questions | . \n  Preparing Your Talk   \n Your work will have a greater impact if you’re well prepared.  \n It is very important that you run to schedule. The LCTES’23 schedule is extremely tight, with hard stops imposed by FCRC scheduling. Session chairs have been asked to stick rigidly to the schedule.  \n Guidelines   \n Your talk should run for no more than 16 minutes | , uninterrupted. This gives you about three minutes for questions and one minute for speaker change-over. \n  Your talk should be prepared for the standard | 16:9 widescreen ratio | . If your talk is in a different ratio, at best it will be | pillarboxed | , wasting screen real estate and diminishing impact, and at worst, it won’t display correctly. \n  You will present your talk from a lectern, using a fixed lectern mic. \n  You will need to provide your talk ahead of time in either pdf or powerpoint. \n  If you have an embedded video in your presentation, please inform the video team via Discord and be sure to test it with them before your session. \n  Uploading Your Presentation   \n As an insurance against technical failures, we ask all speakers to make a backup copy of their presentation available to the video team by uploading it the day before the session. You’re welcome to upload fresh copies at any time.  \n Format: your presentation must be saved as a powerpoint or pdf file (sorry!) \n  Naming: you must use your paper ID as your file name (<LCTES paper ID>.[ppt,pptx,pdf], e.g., LCTES-paper43.pptx) \n  Location: please use this link: | https://bit.ly/pldi23upload \n  This requirement gives you assurance that if some major technical problem were to arise (such as a failure of your laptop), you will still be able to give your talk. If you do not make your presentation available in advance, and significant technical problems arise, we may have to shorten your presentation to keep to our tight schedule.  \n The requirement for you to use pdf or powerpoint for your backup copy is a pragmatic tradeoff. These slides will only be used in case of a technical emergency. We want to have the highest possible assurance that they will work without fuss on a third party device should such an emergency occur. If you use Google slides, Keynote, or some other software, please use the export feature to create either powerpoint or pdf backups.  \n If you elect not to upload a backup copy, please understand that this limits our volunteers’ capacity to assist you if a technical problem arises when you give your presentation.  \n Advice   \n There are many excellent sources of advice on giving good talks, including from Simon Peyton Jones  , Michael Hicks  , Michael Ernst  , and Derek Dreyer  . Make good use of these!  \n Mandatory Video Check   \n All speakers are required to be in the room and check in with their session chair and the video team no later than 5 minutes before their session starts. Please note that due to our very tight schedule, speakers who fail to upload their talk in advance and/or fail to attend the video check 5 minutes before their session may have their talk cut short if technical issues arise  .  \n Q&A   \n If you stick to the above schedule you will have about 3 minutes for questions. The in-room audience will be able to ask questions via a queue at a single microphone on a mic stand in the center of the room. In-room attendees and remote attendees will also be able to ask questions via Discord. Your session chair will monitor questions on Discord and might ask questions as they see them appearing there.  \n It is good practice, as the speaker, to repeat your understanding of the question before providing your answer. This is particularly important when time is tight because it reduces opportunities for time being wasted on account of a misunderstanding.  \n Once your talk is finished, please go on to Discord and respond to any questions or follow-up questions that appear there.  \n Remote Audience   \n Your talk will be streamed to Discord and YouTube with live captioning. Your remote audience will be able to write questions in the Discord channel created for your session (they won’t be able to ask questions via audio or video). They should see your slides, a video feed of you speaking, and live captions. As mentioned above, your session chair may relay questions from Discord.  \n Remote Presenters   \n LCTES’23 authors are expected to be present at the conference. If it is impossible for any of the authors to attend LCTES in person, please let the chairs know immediately.  \n Discord   \n We will use Discord as the virtual platform for this conference. You should familiarize yourself with Discord as an audience member well before your talk. We will use it for: a) the remote audience, b) delivery of remote talks, and c) communicating logistics.  \n Remote speakers will receive instructions on how to present your talk over Discord.  \n Connectivity   \n Please do the best you can to ensure that you have good connectivity at the time of your presentation. To protect against the possibility of a major technical failure, we encourage you to record a 15 minute video version of your talk, and share it with the video team well before your talk (see notes above for sharing slides). The video team can then use your video as a back-up in case of a major problem.  \n Limitations   \n Remote speakers should take care before including embedded audio in their talk. While this is possible, it can be difficult. If you need to do this, please consult directly with the video team and have it tested well in advance.  \n Q&A   \n Your session chair will introduce you and field questions just as for in-person sessions. You do not need to monitor Discord during your talk. Your Q&A will involve answering questions verbally, just as for in-person talks, only you’ll do so via video. As with in-person sessions, timing is very tight, so please be sure to stick to your 15 minute speaking time, or risk losing your Q&A time. You can respond to follow-up questions online after your talk has finished.  \n   \n Attendee's Guide  \n   \n Accessing Papers   \n PLDI papers are all open-access and available from the ACM Digital Library. Just follow the small “DOI” link in the PLDI schedule below the paper.  \n In-Person Attendees   \n The venue for PLDI’23 is Orlando World Center Marriott  .  \n The map here  indicates where you’ll find key events.  \n Registration   \n Please make your way to the FCRC registration desk, which will be in “Palms Registration” until Saturday noon, at which point it will move to \" Cypress 2 Alcove\" for the remainder of FCRC. Both are marked on the map above.  \n Welcome Reception   \n We are holding a joint welcome reception with ISCA in Royal from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm on Sunday. Everyone registered for PLDI (or ISCA) is invited.  \n Catering   \n Lunch and breakfast will be in Cypress 3, with the exception of Monday’s PLDI Awards Lunch, which will be held in Cypress 1.  \n Wi-Fi   \n FCRC provides wifi for the whole event. You should receive information on how to access it at the registration desk.  \n Discord   \n In-person attendees are warmly encouraged to use Discord (details below). You can use it to coordinate with colleagues, get updates on activities, and engage with authors via Q&A. You are very welcome to ask questions via each session’s text channel on Discord, before, during, and after the talk. If the session chair has time, they will ask the question on your behalf. Authors have been asked to check their channel for questions, so you can engage with the authors that way if not in person.  \n Virtual Attendees   \n Watching Talks (YouTube)   \n LCTES will be streamed to YouTube, and accessible to everyone (Tutorials are not streamed by our video team, but organizers may have made their own arrangements).  \n Each session will be streamed separately. The link to LCTES live stream will be visible at the top of the LCTES Discord channel and in the schedule.  \n We have paid for live subtitling of the main PLDI tracks.  \n Engaging in Q&A (Discord)   \n We encourage remote attendees to engage with talks via Discord (details below in the “Using Discord”  section).  \n Using Discord   \n As an affiliated conference, LCTES will use PLDI’s Discord server for virtual engagement. Discord is a social media platform that supports text, voice, and video chats. This section of the guide gives a brief overview of how we’ll use it and pointers to more general tips on how to use Discord.  \n Key information:  \n Our conference is completely | open and free for virtual attendees | , so our Discord server is open to everyone. \n  Please use this link  to join the PLDI’23 Discord server. \n  You can use Discord entirely | from the browser, or via an app | you install. \n  We have | one channel for each technical session | . Use that channel to engage virtually with the authors and other attendees. \n  We ask everyone to | edit their profile | to set their “server nickname” to their preferred name, and their pronouns (if they wish). Updating your avatar with a profile photo can also help improve the virtual experience. \n  Editing Your Profile   \n You first need to open user settings. At the lower left corner, you should see a small icon with your avatar and your Discord username, with a gear symbol to the right of it. If you click on the gear icon, it will open user settings.  \n On the left-hand side, you’ll see menu options. Select “Profiles”.  \n First, update your nickname. Under “Profiles”, select the “Server Profiles” tab, and ensure that the server is “PLDI 2023” under “Choose a server” like this  , and then edit your “Server Nickname” to be your preferred name, including your pronouns if you wish.  \n Next, update your avatar if you wish. Under “Profiles”, select “User Profile” and under “Avatar” select “Change Avatar”.  \n Click on the “X” at the top right to exit the user settings dialogue.  \n PLDI’s Discord Setup   \n The most important thing to know is that we’ll have a text channel for each session, and that’s the place to go to engage with the speakers at that session. You’ll find them listed under “PLDI MAIN TRACK”, “ISMM & LCTES”, and “WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS” respectively, as shown here  . You’ll see one channel per session for PLDI, ISMM, and LCTES and one per event for the workshops and tutorials.  \n You’ll also find links to these channels on the program, such as the link to #pldi-mon-0900-opening-royal in this example screenshot  .  \n We also have a number of other channels, including ones for general questions (#general) and for social events.  \n Discord Etiquette   \n To help make the platform friendly and engaging, we encourage you to clearly identify yourself (see notes above on editing your profile).  \n PLDI is committed to creating a safe and respectful environment for everyone. This includes conversations on Discord. Please be respectful and kind in your interactions on Discord.  \n Discord for talk Q&A   \n You can use Discord to ask questions of the authors, before the talk, during the talk, and after the talk, whether you are on-site or remote. When time permits, during each live post-talk Q&A, session chairs will be able to consult Discord and read questions on behalf of the person who posted it. Authors are encouraged to go to Discord after their talk and respond to follow-up questions.  \n How to Use Discord   \n The basic use of the text channels is quite straightforward.  \n Rather than attempting to provide a first-principles guide on how to use Discord in this document, we encourage you to check out the following references:  \n “How to Use Discord: A Beginner’s Guide” | by Boone Ashworth of Wired. \n  “Beginner’s Guide to Discord” | from Discord. \n  “How to Use Discord: A Beginner’s Guide” | by Marshall Gunnell of PCWorld. \n\n Questions?

The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.  \n Scope   \n In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:  \n Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimization. \n  Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. \n  More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2024 include, but are not limited to:  \n Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. \n  Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. \n  Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. \n  Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. \n  This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the program co-chairs, Guillaume Allais ( guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk  ) and Annie Liu ( liu@cs.stonybrook.edu  ).  \n AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n Supporters   \n\n Call for Papers  \n  \n Three kinds of submissions will be accepted:  \n Regular Research Papers  should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages. \n  Short Papers  may include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages. \n  Talk Proposals  may propose lectures about topics of interest for PEPM, existing work representing relevant contributions, or promising contributions that are not mature enough to be proposed as papers of the other categories. Talk Proposals must not exceed 2 pages. \n  References and appendices are not included in page limits. Appendices may not necessarily be read by reviewers. Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at:  \n http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   \n and submitted electronically via HotCRP: https://pepm25.hotcrp.com   \n Reviewing will be single-blind.  \n Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs).  \n Accepted regular research papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted short papers do not constitute formal publications and will not appear in the proceedings.  \n At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop (physically or virtually) to present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected.  \n\n Invited Speakers  \n\n William Bowman  – University of British Columbia   \n   \n Brigitte Pientka  – McGill University   \n   \n Satnam Singh  – Groq   \n\n Abstracts   \n\n The Ethical Compiler: Addressing the Is-Ought Gap in Compilation    \n   William Bowman    \n The is-ought gap is a problem in moral philosophy observing that ethical judgments (“ought”) cannot be grounded purely in truth judgments (“is”): that an ought  cannot be derived from an is  . This gap renders the following argument invalid: “It is  true that type safe languages prevent bugs and that bugs cause harm, therefore you ought  to write in type safe languages.”. To validate ethical claims, we must bridge the gap between is and ought with some ethical axiom, such as “I believe one ought  not cause harm.”.  \n But what do ethics have to do with manipulating programs? A lot! Ethics are central to correctness! For example, suppose an algorithm infers the type of e  is Bool  , and e  is in fact a Bool  ; the program type checks. Is the program correct—does it behave as it ought  ? We cannot answer this without some ethical axioms: what does the programmer believe ought  to be?  \n I believe one ought to design and implement languages ethically. We must give the programmer the ability to express their ethics—their values and beliefs about a program—in addition to its mere computational content, and build tools that respect the distinction between is and ought. This talk is a guide to ethical language design and implementation possibilities.  \n Bio    \n William J. Bowman is an Assistant Professor of computer science in the Software Practices Lab at University of British Columbia. Broadly speaking, he is interested in making it easier for programmers to communicate their intent to machines, and preserving that intent through compilation. More specifically, their research interests include secure and verified compilation, dependently typed programming, verification, meta-programming, and interoperability. His recent work examines type-preserving compilation of dependently typed programming languages like Coq, a technique that can enable preserving security and correctness invariants of verified software through compilation and statically enforcing those invariants in the low-level (assembly-like) code generated by compilers.  \n\n Cocon: A Type-Theoretic Framework for Meta-Programming    \n   Brigitte Pientka    \n Meta-programming is the art of writing programs that produce or manipulate other programs. This allows programmers to automate error-prone or repetitive tasks, and exploit domain- specific knowledge to customize the generated code. Hence, meta-programming is widely used in a range of technologies: from cryptographic message authentication in secure network protocols to support reflection in proof environments such as Lean.  \n Unfortunately, writing safe meta-programs remains very challenging and sometimes frustrating, as traditionally errors in the generated code are only detected when running it, but not at the time when code is generated. To make it easier to write and maintain meta-programs, tools that allow us to detect errors during code generation - instead of when running the generated code - are essential.  \n This talk revisits Cocon, a framework for certified meta-programming. Cocon is a Martin-Löf dependent type theory for defining logics and proofs that allows us to represent domain-specific languages (DSL) within the logical framework LF and in addition write recursive programs and proofs about those DSLs using pattern matching. It is a two-level type theory where Martin-Löf type theory sits on top of the logical framework LF and supports a recursor over (contextual) LF objects. As a consequence, we can embed into LF STLC or System F, etc. and then write programs about those encodings using Cocon itself.  \n This means Cocon can serve as a target for compiling meta-programming systems -from compiling meta-programming with STLC to System F. Moreover, Cocon supports writing an evaluator for each of these sub-languages. This also allows us to reflect back our encoded sub-language and evaluate their encodings using Cocon’s evaluation strategy.  \n I will conclude with highlighting more recent research directions and challenges that build on the core ideas of Cocon and aim to support meta-programming and intensional code analysis directly in System F and Martin-Löf type theory.  \n Bio    \n Brigitte Pientka a Full Professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill University. Her main research interests lie in developing theoretical foundations of programming languages. A central question of her work is: How can we design programming languages that ensure that programs are safe and have fewer bugs? In 2018, her work on the Beluga programming language has received the Test of Time Award from International Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming (PPDP).  \n Brigitte Pientka is a leader within the programming languages research community, and serves for example on the SIGPLAN executive committee. In particular, she is passionate about working towards overcoming systemic barriers for underrepresented groups. In 2018, she co-founded the Women in Logic workshop which provides valuable networking opportunity to female researchers and as the general chair for POPL in 2020 she introduced Mentoring Breakfasts which now are a fixture at SIGPLAN events.  \n\n The Missing Diagonal: High Level Languages for Low Level Systems    \n   Satnam Singh    \n The computing community has produced many high level languages and tools for programming high level systems (e.g. Java for user interfaces) and it has produced many low level languages and tools for programming low level systems (C for operating systems, Verilog for hardware design) yet there are not many examples of high level systems that have been produced to help develop low level systems. Sometimes this is due to a suspicion that the layers of abstraction that high level systems use incur unacceptable performance overheads. However, this talk attempts to challenge that view, giving examples of high level systems that improve the designer productivity for developing low level systems which also improve the quality of verification for low level systems.  \n The talk will draw examples from the presenter’s own experience, as well as the work of others. Specific examples will include Lava and Bluespec for the design of hardware, the Silver Oak project for the co-design of a high assurance silicon root of trust, a Haskell-based DSL for programming machine learning chips, and recent work on the specification and verification of parts of a new silicon chip produced at Groq which makes use of the same Haskell DSL.  \n Bio    \n Satnam Singh is a Fellow at Groq where he applies the power of functional programming languages to the design of machine learning chips and their programming models. Satnam Singh previously worked at Google (machine learning chips, cluster management), Facebook (Android optimization), Microsoft (parallel and concurrent programming) and Xilinx (Lava DSL for hardware design). He started his career as an academic at the University of Glasgow (FPGA-based application acceleration and functional programming).  \n\n Questions?

Since its inception in 1982, PODC has established itself as the premier annual meeting for researchers interested in the foundations of distributed computing. PODC is a prestigious forum with a long history of more than 40 years, taken place in many different countries to better serve the needs of its community. Prominent researchers of the PODC community have introduced various influential concepts and technologies in research areas such as blockchains and decentralized finances, coding and reliable communication, communication networks, concurrency and synchronization, fault-tolerance and consensus, distributed and cloud storage, distributed computation for large-scale data, distributed machine learning and artificial intelligence, distributed operating systems and middleware, distributed databases, high-performance, cluster, cloud and grid computing, internet applications, mobile computing and autonomous agents, peer-to-peer systems, overlay networks, social networks, security and cryptography in distributed computing, wireless, sensor, mesh, and ad hoc networks, and many others. PODC is the home for cutting-edge research on distributed computing with the power to drive industrial innovation. It usually hosts a number of timely workshops, where researchers can exchange ideas and discuss share results. PODC 2025 will be held at Huatulco, Mexico, on June 16-20, 2025.  \n   \n  PODC attracts leading researchers from both academia and industry. It has around 180 registrants per year with ~35% of them being students. Over the years, PODC has ensured the presence of industry in the conference not only among its attendees but also in the list of its invited speakers and through representation to its committees and activities. In previous years, PODC had support by most of the worldwide influential companies (see last page for a list), as well as by distributed-computing startup companies.  \n Sponsorship Benefits   \n Through PODC, many sponsors have the opportunity to come in touch with promising students and young researchers that have the potential to play a leading role in their company. PODC 2025 will host a school for PhD students and young researchers providing increased recruitment opportunities. Moreover, PODC provides excellent opportunities for networking and connecting with leading researchers and practitionersin the area of distributed systems and networks. We encourage you to sponsor PODC 2025 to ensureyour organization’s presence at a conference that brings together the current and future elite of distributed computing researchers. We hope to have your support in 2025!  \n Sponsorship Schemes   \n PODC supports four types of sponsorship, as illustrated in Table below.
