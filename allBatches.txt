ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40)  .  \n Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.  \n ANT will be held in Patra Greece. Patra is Greece's third largest, and the regional capital and largest city of western Greece, in the northern Peloponnese, 215 km west of Athens. As of the 2021 census, the municipality of Patras has a population of 215,922, while the urban population is 173.600. Patras and its region are home to various Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monuments including the Roman Odeon, the Fortress of Rio, and the Castle of Patras. Patras is a relatively newly built city, as its medieval buildings were destroyed in the Greek War of Independence. The Patras Carnival is the largest event of its kind in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe, with a heritage reaching back 160 years.  \n Patras is an important educational center in Greece, home to several institutions of higher education, including the prestigious University of Patras, which is the third largest university in Greece with the respect to the size of the student body, the staff, and the number of departments. and most respected universities. The university of Patras is considered one of the top-ranked universities in Greece and has been placed in the top 200 universities in subject areas. In 2019, the student population was more than 33,000 (29,901 at the undergraduate level and 3,931 at the postgraduate level).  \n All ANT 2025 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide.

This page links to previous SIGCOMM conferences.   \n Mission   \n SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM), a vital special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).   \n The annual SIGCOMM conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions to the field of computer and data communication networks. We invite submissions on network architecture, design, implementation, operations, analysis, measurement, and simulation.   \n Full papers are no more than 14 pages long and typically report novel results firmly substantiated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. Posters present ongoing work on one 30\" x 40\" (75cm x 100cm) page. Student poster submissions will be favored.   \n Papers are double-blind reviewed (no author identification) by a technical program committee (TPC). Depending on the year and the program chairs, the TPC can have between 20-40 researchers.

      "conferenceText": "Conference ANT_3:\nThe 15th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies  \n  April 23-25, 2024, Hasselt, Belgium   \n\n  to ANT 2024  \n The 15th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2024) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2024 will be held in conjunction with the 7th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40)  .  \n Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.  \n ANT 2024 will be held in the city of Hasselt. Hasselt was founded in approximately the 7th century on the Helbeek, a small tributary of the Demer  river. The name Hasselt came from Hasaluth  , which means hazel wood. During the Middle Ages, it became one of the bigger towns of the county of Loon  , which had borders approximately the same as the current province of Limburg. Hasselt is an old yet modern city which is home to multiple academic institutions and where visitors can enjoy a variety of activities and entertainment.  \n ANT 2024 is co-organized & co-hosted by the Hasselt University, Belgium  . Since 1973 Hasselt University is located on the Campus Diepenbeek, which occupies an attractive 150 acre site in the middle of Limburg's green belt. It is 2 kms west of the town centre of Diepenbeek, a residential town of 17.717 inhabitants, and 4 kms east of Hasselt which has a population of about 69.529 and is the administrative and commercial centre of the province. Brussels is 90 kms away (to the South-West), Antwerp lies 90 kms to the West, Liege (in the French-speaking part of Belgium) 45 kms to the South, Maastricht (in the Netherlands) 25 kms to the East, Aachen (in Germany) 60 kms to the South-East.  \n   \n All ANT 2024 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (http://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/). All papers in Procedia will also be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Engineering Village (Ei) (www.engineeringvillage.com). This includes EI Compendex (www.ei.org/compendex). Moreover, all accepted papers will be indexed in DBLP (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/). The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers. You will be able to provide a hyperlink to all delegates and direct your conference website visitors to your proceedings.  \n (optional) Social Event @ ANT 2024  \n     \n Visit to the C-mine expedition :  (located in the nearby city of Genk)  \n C-mine expedition starts in the energy building of the C-mine site. First you descend to 6 meter deep where you get to see a lot of surprising installations. Famous artists such as Stijn Meuris and Pascale Platel made unique stories about the mine in combination with creative image projections. In the interactive sound cell you are going to get busy. Produce your own 'sound ' by levers, buttons and wheels to operate. Or sample the atmosphere while you're wondering around in the maze on the way to the topsoil.The highlight of the expedition is to climb the giant and authentic mine tower on the square. That is more than 60 meters high! Perhaps you reach the top exhausted, but the reward is greater: gorgeous views of the green surroundings of Limburg. For the slightly less ' big ' daredevil, there is a stop at 15 metres height. If you don't like heights, stay comfortable with both feet firmly on the ground. Just enjoy the open feeling on the beautifully renovated square.  \n\n  ===================================================================  \n In Conjunction with   \n\n  The 7th International Conference on  \n   Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40)       \n\n Copyright ©.

We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.  \n  Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.  \n Program Chairs  \n Michail Maniatakos (New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE) \n  Yinqian Zhang (Southern University of Science and Technology, China) \n  Important Dates  \n Cycle 1 Deadline   \n Paper Submission: | 20 September 2024 (AoE) \n  Early Rejection: | 25 October 2024 \n  Author Notification: | 13 December 2024 \n  Camera Ready: | 11 January 2025 \n  Cycle 2 Deadline   \n Paper Submission: | 20 January 2025 (AoE) \n  Early Rejection: | 28 February 2025 \n  Author Notification: | 19 April 2025 \n  Camera Ready: | 25 May 2025 \n  Submission Instructions  \n Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org  for any questions regarding the submissions.  \n  \n SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE   Paper Formatting   \n Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template (available here  ). All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  \n Conflicts of Interest   \n When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:  \n Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission. \n  Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past. \n  Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years. \n  PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.  \n Anonymous Submissions   \n  \n ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.  \n Double and Concurrent Submissions   \n Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.  \n Ethical Considerations   \n The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.  \n Early Rejection and Appeals   \n There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  \n Paper Revision and Resubmission   \n Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2. A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.  \n Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation   \n If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.  \n Contact  \n For any questions related to paper submissions, please contact the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org  .  \n\n © ACM ASIACCS 2025.

Bringing together top researchers and practitioners, CSCW 2025 will explore topics across sociotechnical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, design, entertainment, and ethics, including social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, and technologies for co-located or remote collaboration, communication, education, work articulation, coordination, awareness, and information sharing.  \n Papers are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems; or introduce new approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems. Submissions exploring how computing technologies — including those linked to recent developments in AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR — relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, providing they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues  . Submissions by members of underrepresented groups are particularly welcome. Authors exploring historical and sociotechnical perspectives on CSCW systems are also encouraged to submit.  \n We invite contributions to CSCW across a variety of human-centered research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including:  \n Social and crowd computing. | Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds, or collaborative information behaviors. \n  CSCW and social computing system development. | Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that are explored and discussed within the context of building new social and collaborative systems and experiences. \n  Methodologies and tools. | Novel human-centered methods, or combinations of approaches and tools used in building collaborative systems or studying their use. \n  Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses. | Studies of technologically enabled social, cooperative, and collaborative practices within and beyond work settings illuminating their historical, social, and material specificity, and/or exploring their political or ethical dimensions. \n  Empirical investigations. | Findings, guidelines, and/or studies of social practices, communication, cooperation, collaboration, or use, as related to CSCW and social technologies. \n  Domain-specific social, cooperative, and collaborative applications. | Including applications to healthcare, transportation, design, manufacturing, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains. \n  Ethics and policy implications. | Analysis of the implications of sociotechnical systems in social, cooperative and collaborative practices, as well as the algorithms that shape them. \n  CSCW and social computing systems based on emerging technologies. | Including mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, computer-aided or robotically-supported work, and sensing systems. \n  Crossing boundaries. | Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across fields of research, disciplines, distances, languages, generations, and cultures to help better understand how CSCW and social systems might help transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries. \n  Send queries about paper submissions to papers2025@cscw.acm.org  .  \n To promote work-life balance, we have set all deadlines on Tuesdays to avoid weekends at any time zone.  \n SUBMISSION PROCESS   \n SUBMISSION MODEL   \n To support diverse and high-quality contributions, CSCW uses a two-cycle review process with the opportunity for major revisions reviewed by the same reviewers. Accepted papers are published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction  (PACM HCI) Journal.  \n CSCW 2025 will follow the half-yearly submission model implemented in CSCW 2022. Thus, new paper submissions will be only possible for the July 2024  and October 2024  deadlines. We have four additional deadlines in December, March, April, and July for revisions only. Failure to submit a revised version of a paper by the associated deadline means that the paper has been withdrawn.  \n Below is an overview of the submission timeline. All a  ccepted papers from these two cycles will be invited to present at CSCW 2025.   \n   JULY 2024 CYCLE   \n July 2, 2024: | New paper submissions due 23:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time. | Expected notification date: | Oct 9, 2024 AoE. \n  Possible outcomes: | Major Revisions, Minor Revisions, Reject. \n  October 29, 2024: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Nov 19, 2024. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept or Reject. \n  December 10, 2024: | Resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Feb 12, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept with Minor Revisions, Reject. \n  March 4, 2025: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation after Major Revisions due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Mar 26, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept or Reject. \n  OCTOBER 2024 CYCLE   \n October 29, 2024: | New paper submissions due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Feb 12, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Major Revisions, Minor Revisions, Reject. \n  March 4, 2025: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Mar 26, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept or Reject. \n  April 15, 2025: | Resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Jun 11, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept with Minor Revisions, Reject. \n  Jul 1, 2025: | Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation after Major Revisions due 23:59 AoE. | Expected notification date: | Aug 6, 2025. \n  Possible outcomes: | Accept or Reject. \n  2025 Submissions   \n The next paper submission deadline is expected to be in May 2025. This will be announced by the 2026 Chairs once the submission deadline is finalized.  \n PROCESS DETAILS   \n CSCW 2025 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: https://new.precisionconference.com  . Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the SIGCHI Submission and Review Policy, including, but not limited to:  \n That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work. \n  Occasionally, a paper may have some overlap with a prior publication (for example, there is some overlap with the datasets used, but the analyses in each paper are considered to be a completely different and substantial contribution). This | must | be disclosed to the editorial team at the time of submission. Authors must provide a detailed explanation of the overlap and distinct contribution of each paper in the “Comments (optional)” field on the submission form. Please make sure to refer and adhere to the ACM policy in reuse of content from prior publications available at: | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions \n  Similarly, for parallel submissions (authors submitting multiple papers related to the same study), authors also need to provide information about the relationship between submissions, as well as how they are different from one another in the “Comments (optional)” field of the submission form. Please make sure to refer and adhere to the ACM policy in simultaneous submissions available at: | https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions \n  That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue. \n  For information about re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to section 1.5.4 of the ACM SIGCHI policy.  \n Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that is or will be proprietary and/or confidential at the time of publication and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the PACM HCI and the ACM Digital Library.  \n Authors should adhere to the new ACM policy in authorship, available at https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship  .  \n PAPER GUIDELINES REGARDING SCOPE   \n CSCW is a broad and interdisciplinary field, covering many methods, theories, and epistemologies. It is difficult to draw explicit disciplinary boundaries of what counts and what does not count as CSCW research. Nonetheless, in the spirit of welcoming those new and not as familiar to CSCW, we believe it is beneficial to offer some guidelines when deciding whether your submissions are appropriate for CSCW.  \n In general, contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation  and be  properly contextualized   in the CSCW literature  , with clear reference to CSCW concepts and/or theories informing, being affected or being proposed. Please note that papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to individual users will be considered out of scope. For example, this would include papers whose major contribution is on user research findings that inform the design of a system primarily focused on benefiting a sole, individual user. Also, systems-based or algorithmic research not making explicit how it involves aspects of cooperative, collaborative or social computing are not within the scope of CSCW.  \n Therefore, authors should clearly answer yes to the following:  \n Does your work build upon, bridge, discuss, or cite prior CSCW work in a significant manner? Does it make clear how it offers new knowledge of benefit to the CSCW community? \n  Have you clearly elaborated on how the results of your work are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions? \n  Authors must make sure that their submission is within the scope of the conference. During the submission, authors will be asked to write a short paragraph explaining how this is the case. Contributions out of scope will be desk rejected.   The scope statement should be fully anonymized to ensure the double-blind review process – see section on anonymous review policy below. Please ensure your statement does not contain any information that can identify any of the authors, their institutions, partners, or cities.  \n ANONYMOUS REVIEW POLICY   \n Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names  and affiliations  removed, including references to universities, institutional review boards,   companies, labs, and cities  . Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Furthermore, obvious identifying statements and information that might confuse reviewers regarding the authors (e.g., mock authors’ names originally in templates provided to demonstrate formatting) should be removed. Images used in the paper must NOT disclose the authors identity or suggest affiliation. This policy includes all submitted materials, including supplemental materials and the scope statement. Papers that violate this policy will be desk rejected.    \n Please check in particular the first page, headers and footers, images, the acknowledgements section, AND meta-data of all   submitted file   s   .  For resubmissions, make sure that the authors’ identities are not disclosed in the annotated document submitted in addition to the clean version. If possible, check the document with tracked changes in different PDF readers. It is possible that some tracked-change information that is visible in a reader (e.g., Adobe Acrobat) is not visible in others (e.g., Preview).  \n Citations to authors’ own relevant work should NOT be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work…”  \n CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the peer review process, we ask that no authors publicize the work until the review process is complete  . Please do not share any confidential information specific to a current review process publicly or on social media, with the exception of doing public exhibitions, festivals, and performances as part of the research where the name is integral to the work.  \n When submitting your papers to PCS, please also ensure your scope statement follows the anonymous review policy.  \n We also ask reviewers to refrain from taking steps to learn about authors’ identity during the peer review process.  \n FORMATTING AND LENGTH   \n Word authors:  Because CSCW papers are published in PACM HCI, which uses the Sheridan service, authors need to use the old interim ACM Small template,  which is ONLY available at the following link:  \n  https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates   \n LaTeX authors  need to use the template at  \n  https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions  , and insert the acmsmall call.  \n Overleaf authors  need to use the template at  \n  https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf  , and use the acmsmall call.  \n Papers that use a completely different template will be  desk rejected.    Small variance on font styles, which is possible when authors do not have particular fonts installed in their computers, will be tolerated for the initial submission but will have to be fixed in case the paper is accepted for publication.  \n Note:  In preparing revisions, authors should continue using the template they had used for their original submissions. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. If a paper is shorter than 5000 words or exceeds 12,000 words, it will be submitted to additional scrutiny. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be  rejected   .  Note that additional materials can be submitted as appendices but be aware that reviewers are not bound to decide based on these materials.  \n POLICY ON USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs) AND OTHER AI TOOLS   \n If AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were used in the writing of the paper beyond a simple grammar check, their use should be acknowledged and described in the text of the submitted version. ACM policy  states that authors must be the “creator or originator of an idea” and/or work, so relying on AI-tools to generate ideas in the manuscript is not allowed. Note that we will investigate submissions brought to our attention for undeclared use of LLMs or other AI-tools.  \n DECISIONS AND DEADLINES   \n CSCW will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 2-4 months from the initial submission (depending on the cycle). For the July 2024 submission deadline, we hope to send out all final notifications by Mar 26, 2025, i.e., after final acceptance of papers that receive a Major Revisions notification after initial submission. For the October 2024 submission deadline, all final notifications should be out by Aug 6, 2025, i.e., after final acceptance of papers that initially received a Major Revisions recommendation for that cycle.  \n Accept: | Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted for verification by the corresponding Associate Chair (1AC). The submission will appear in an upcoming issue of the PACM HCI. \n  Minor revision: | Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication. The revised submission MUST be submitted along with a brief response to the reviewers’ comments. The revision will be verified by the corresponding Associate Chair (1AC) and if approved, the submission will be promoted to an accepted paper. \n  Major revision: | Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, then re-reviewed. For July 2024 submissions receiving a Major Revision decision must be resubmitted by the December 2024 deadline. For October 2024 submissions, major revisions are due in April 2025. The authors must ensure that the paper has been revised sufficiently to warrant re-review. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same AC and reviewers for re-review. Upon re-review, submissions can receive one of two decisions: Accept with minor revisions or Reject. Unlike most journals, the current CSCW review process does NOT allow for more than one major revision recommendation due to reviewer availability and time constraints. \n  Reject: | Authors of rejected papers are allowed to resubmit their papers under special conditions. Please refer to the section | Resubmission of Rejected and Withdrawn Papers. \n  Desk / Quick Reject: | Authors should only submit completed work of | publishable quality | and | within the scope of ACM CSCW | . Editors will | desk reject | papers that do not comply with such requirements. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will also be | desk rejected | without review. Finally, the ACs, in cooperation with the Editors, may Quick Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. While we endeavor to notify authors early in the process, desk or quick rejects may happen at | any time | throughout the review process up until notifications. \n  RESUBMISSION OF REJECTED AND WITHDRAWN PAPERS   \n Papers in the following categories can be resubmitted at the next submission deadline:  \n Papers that have been desk or quick rejected \n  Papers that got Minor Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn) \n  Papers that gets rejected after resubmitting Major Revisions \n  On the other hand, papers that fall in one of the following categories must wait an extra deadline to be resubmitted:  \n Papers that get rejected in first review round \n  Papers that got Major Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn) \n  For example, if the paper was rejected after the initial submission in July 2024, authors cannot re-submit in the October 2024 cycle, but can resubmit the paper after    the October 2024 cycle.  \n Please notice that all resubmitted papers will be treated as a new submission, meaning they will most likely be assigned to a new Editor, new ACs, and new reviewers. Papers resubmitted with no or marginal changes (except resubmission of minor revisions papers that missed the resubmission deadline) will be desk rejected  without review.  \n Authors must describe the paper’s submission history and briefly outline the changes in a designated field in PCS when resubmitting. Failure to disclose the paper’s submission history may lead to a desk reject  decision. ACs and reviewers will have access to this description of the paper’s submission history and may also request to review the detailed submission history.  \n DECISION APPEAL PROCESS   \n We recognize that authors may sometimes feel a review is unfair, inappropriate, or problematic in other ways. CSCW has implemented the following process for authors who wish to appeal a decision:  \n Either: | Authors directly contact the Papers Chairs to officially appeal a decision \n  A committee member (1AC / 2AC / Editor / Papers Chair) raises an issue about the decision or decision-making process, possibly in response to a communication from an author \n  The appeal involves motivating the case with evidence \n  Papers Chairs assess the situation and make an initial call to bring it up for discussion with the Editors \n  The Editor assigned to the submission reviews the paper, the reviews, and the discussion in PCS to determine if the case is valid. The Editor may choose to involve the ACs at this stage \n  Other Editors weigh in and review the case \n  The Editors come to a collective decision and share their decision with the Papers Chairs \n  The Papers Chairs discuss the Editors’ decision. If a change is agreed, Papers Chairs record the updated decision in PCS \n  The Papers Chairs communicate the final decision to the authors. Decisions are final and further appeals will not be pursued. \n  Appeals must be submitted no later than seven days after the decision notification is out. Any appeal submitted after that time limit will not be pursued.   \n PRIMARY RESEARCH PARADIGM   \n When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be asked to indicate the primary research paradigm of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment. Currently there are six paradigm choices available:  \n Technical/Systems, e.g., building novel CSCW systems, algorithms, implementing novel features in existing systems, etc. \n  Empirical–Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, workplace studies, qualitative user studies, etc. \n  Empirical–Quantitative, e.g., “big data,” quantitative user studies, statistical methods, etc. \n  Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research, design explorations combined with technical feature development, etc. \n  Design, e.g., design implications, guidelines, methods, techniques, etc. \n  Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning CSCW studies/domains, theoretical analysis, literature reviews, and essays, etc. \n  OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SCIENCE   \n Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. Authors are encouraged to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors are also encouraged to use open access repositories and make their data and other material FAIR when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to describe efforts to make their work more reproducible. Reviewers are encouraged to support evolving approaches to supporting open and transparent research practices.  \n VIDEO FIGURES   \n Authors may consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission (no more than three minutes long). Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.  \n PRESENTING AT THE CONFERENCE   \n Accepted papers are invited to present at the corresponding conference, and authors can choose whether or not they wish to present. If a situation arises and an author who is scheduled to present at the conference is no longer able to, they should immediately reach out to the Papers Chairs to discuss alternative options. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required.  \n PAPERS CHAIRS   \n Contact:  papers2025@cscw.acm.org   \n Xiaojuan Ma (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR) \n  Xinru Page (Brigham Young University, USA) \n  Chiara Rossitto (Stockholm University, Sweden) \n  Norman Makoto Su (University of California, Santa Cruz, USA) \n  GENERAL CHAIRS   \n Contact:  chairs2025@cscw.acm.org    \n Fabiano Pinatti (University of Oslo, Norway) \n  Jessica Vitak (University of Maryland, USA) \n\n Copyright © 2024 CSCW 2025 | Powered by Astra WordPress Theme   \n\n    Scroll to Top"

This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The new SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field.   \n ACM SenSys 2025  will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, but retaining the current SenSys name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) due to the time required for institutional approvals. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. We are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.   \n\n Latest News  \n 11/07/2024    \n Abstract registration is now optional.     \n\n Abstract registration before paper submission is now optional.

The list of tracks and content areas can be found below. \n  EC’25 is continuing the forward-to-journal option as in previous years. \n  EC’25 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event. \n   \n Policy for Accepted Papers  \n At least one author  of each accepted paper must attend and present the paper. We are willing to make exceptions in rare cases such as severe illness, visa denial, or a death in the family. If no author(s) will be able to attend, please write back to us (the General Chair, PC Chairs, and Virtual Chair) and explain the reason(s) for your absence. In approved instances, the authors will have the opportunity to present their work in the online preview week, either live or self-recorded. The presentation time will be as in the conference 18 minutes.  \n Background  \n Since 1999, the ACM Special Interest Group on Economics and Computation (SIGecom) has sponsored the leading scientific conference on advances in theory, empirics, and applications at the interface of economics and computation. The 26th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC’25) will feature invited speakers, a technical program of submitted paper presentations, workshops, and posters. EC’25 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event, taking place from July 7 through July 12, 2025 at Stanford University  .  \n  We solicit paper submissions for presentation in the technical program.  \n  \n Timetable for Authors  \n Monday, February 3, 2025 (11:59 pm AoE): Abstract submission deadline. \n  Monday, February 10, 2025 (11:59 pm AoE): Paper submission deadline. \n  Thursday, March 27, 2025: First-round decisions sent to authors. \n  Tuesday, April 22, 2025: Second-round reviews sent to authors for feedback. \n  Friday, April 25, 2025 (11:59pm AoE): Author responses due. \n  Saturday May 17, 2025: Paper accept/reject notifications. \n  TBA (11:59pm AoE): Camera-ready versions of accepted papers due. \n  July 7-12, 2025: Conference technical program. \n   \n Submission Instructions  \n Submit a Paper   \n Identifiers.  Authors must submit abstracts by February 3 and full papers by February 10. The submission server will open mid-January.  \n Format.  The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long. The title page should only contain the title, submission number, and the abstract. In addition, an appendix of arbitrary length may be included at the end of the paper only for the review process (i.e., an appendix will not appear if the paper is published). This appendix will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. To add the submission number to the title page, one must first submit a paper without a number, see what number was assigned, and then revise the submission to include this number. The body of the submission should contain a clear presentation of the contributions of the paper, including a discussion of prior work and an outline of the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission as a whole should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the paper. Submitted papers will be evaluated on significance of the contribution, originality, relation to prior research, technical quality, and exposition.  \n LaTex style files.  Authors will be required to format their submissions using the EC’25 LaTex style files   , which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’25 LaTex style files or violate the page limit may be rejected without review.  \n Tracks.  Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions. The reviewing process of each track will be overseen by the corresponding Track Chair(s), who are primarily responsible for ensuring that consistent reviewing standards are applied to all papers in the same track. Authors should consider the description of the tracks to select which track best captures the research community according to whose standards their paper should be evaluated. Authors from any research community are welcome to submit to any of the tracks. EC’25 will use the following four tracks:  \n Theory: | Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly. | Track chairs: Nima Haghpanah, Annie Liang,  Ruta Mehta, Mallesh Pai, Grant Schoenebeck | . \n  Applied Modeling: | Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. | Track chairs: Nick Arnosti, Eduardo Azevedo, Sigal Oren | . \n  Empirics: | Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources or experiments. | Track chairs: Chiara Farronato, Denis Nekipelov | . \n  AI: | Typical papers in this track apply the methods and models of artificial intelligence, including both theoretical and computational approaches, to topics at the intersection of economics and computing. | Track chairs: Annie Liang, Grant Schoenebeck, Nisarg Shah | . \n  Areas.  Each submission must select at least one content area from the list provided below. Note that the areas are partially overlapping; if in doubt, authors are advised to select those area(s) that best fit their paper. Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Senior Program Committee (SPC) who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. SPCs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Track and Program Chairs.  \n Agent-based modeling \n  Algorithmic fairness and data privacy \n  Auctions and pricing \n  Behavioral economics and bounded rationality \n  Blockchain and cryptocurrencies \n  Contract design \n  Crowdsourcing and information elicitation \n  Decision theory \n  Econometrics \n  Economic aspects of learning algorithms \n  Economic aspects of neural networks and large language models \n  Equilibrium analysis, including price of anarchy \n  Equilibrium computation and complexity \n  Fair division \n  Industrial organization \n  Information design \n  Laboratory and field experiments \n  Market design & matching markets \n  Market equilibria \n  Mechanism design \n  Online algorithms \n  Online platforms and applications \n  Social good and ethics \n  Social choice & voting theory \n  Social networks and social learning \n  Alternative venues.  In addition, we will ask the authors to specify alternative venues to which they would consider submitting the paper. We understand that different communities have different ways of highlighting the contribution and will use this information to match papers to reviewers familiar with the appropriate context.  \n Review process.  Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees.  \n  There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 27 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 17 after a second round of reviews. Between April 22-25, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.  \n  The review process is double blind. Authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”).  \n Submission of code and data.  In the interest of reproducibility, authors are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data, if any. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.  \n One-page extended abstract option.  To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. Authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted electronically and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.  \n Submission of publicly available work (e.g., papers on arXiv).  (e.g., papers on arXiv). It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.  \n Simultaneous submissions to journals.  As in prior years, it is acceptable to simultaneously submit papers to EC’25 and to a journal, or to submit papers that are already under review at a journal, including papers that have already received a “revise and resubmit”, as long as the paper has not been accepted for publication prior to the EC submission deadline, and provided that the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in EC. Papers that are accepted at EC’25 and appear as a one-page abstract can subsequently be submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other archival conference (i.e., with published proceedings).  \n No other simultaneous submissions.  The following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’25 submission deadline, (c) papers in which one or more of the contributions have previously been published or accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference.  \n Highlights beyond EC.  Papers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’25 called “Highlights beyond EC”, which is intended to highlight some of the best work in economics and computation that has appeared elsewhere. The corresponding call for nominations will be announced soon.  \n Forward to journal:  As in prior years, authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice. The decision to select or decline this option will take place when authors are submitting the camera-ready version of the paper (or one-page abstract) for the conference proceedings and additional instructions for authors will be provided at that time. Our partner journals are:  \n ACM Transactions on Economics and Computatio | n \n  American Economic Journal: Microeconomics \n  Algorithmica \n  Econometrica | Notes: | A submission would require the standard submission fee. Authors should clearly state in the cover letter that the paper is a forward to journal from EC 25. This would allow editors to get access to the reviews. In addition, | authors should submit the paper together with a short revision plan, instead of the detailed response letter that is submitted to reviewers in a revision. The Editor in charge could then use any subset of the EC reviewers he/she would find useful. The short “revision plan” is intended to prevent authors from spending significant time responding to comments and then having the paper dismissed if the Editor in charge doesn’t think there’s a path forward. \n  Games and Economic Behavior \n  International Economic Review \n  International Journal of Game Theory \n  Journal of Political Economy \n  Management Science | , Market Design, Platform, and Demand Analytics area \n  Marketing Science \n  Mathematics of Operations Research | , Game Theory area | Notes: The journal is open to considering forward-to-journals to other areas, if the authors believe a different area is a better fit. Please contact the Editor. \n  Operations Research | , Markets, Platforms, and Revenue Management area | Notes: Please read carefully the conference to journal submission policy. | https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/opre/conference-to-journal-submission-policy | When utilizing the forward-to-journal from EC to Operations Research, adding a response document discussing the reviewer comments and whether/how they have been addressed is recommended. \n  Quantitative Marketing and Economics \n  RAND Journal of Economics \n  Review of Economic Studies \n  Social Choice and Welfare \n  TheoretiCS \n  Theoretical Economics \n  We emphasize that the ultimate disposition of the paper is within the editorial discretion of each journal; in particular, there is no guarantee of acceptance if the forward-to-journal option is chosen. However, we do anticipate that this process should result in a faster decision from the journal.  \n  \n Feature at INFORMS.  Authors of accepted papers can indicate if they wish to be considered for presenting their papers in special sessions at the 2025 INFORMS Annual Meeting, organized and sponsored by the INFORMS Auctions and Market Design (AMD) Section. To be considered for this fast-track selection process conducted by the AMD cluster chairs, authors will need to provide a short non-technical abstract (at most 500 characters) and indicate whether the intended presenter is an INFORMS job market candidate. The exact deadline to submit this information will be announced soon.  \n Conflict of interest.  Authors will have the opportunity to declare conflicts of interest (COIs) with Program Committee members. This must be done separately for each submission. Declaring COIs prevents the specified people from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship. Instead, when declaring COIs, authors are asked to follow the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy  . Program Committee members can also declare a conflict of interest with authors as well as with specific papers.  \n AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy  will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n Questions?  \n Contact the PC chairs at ecchairs2025@gmail.com   \n\n Papers \n  Workshops & Tutorials \n  Posters \n  Highlights Beyond EC \n  Sponsorship Opportunities \n\n Papers \n  Workshops & Tutorials \n  Posters \n  Highlights Beyond EC \n  Sponsorship Opportunities \n\n Copyright © 2024 EC 2025.

Similar to full papers, accepted short papers will be presented orally at the conference.   \n   \n Submission Guidelines:  \n Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be at most 12 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages  with 10-pt font size (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables.  As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here  . LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font (override default font of 9-pt). Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system.  \n   \n  Papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library and presented in person at the conference.   \n SenSys 2025 Conference Submission System   \n   \n Important Dates:  \n Abstract Registration:  November 7, 2024 23:59 AoE  November 14, 2024 23:59 AoE  \n Paper Submission Deadline:  November 14, 2024 23:59 AoE  \n Acceptance Notification:  January 21, 2025  \n\n © ACM SenSys 2025: The 23rd ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems  \n  Template by Xiaoying Riley"

We believe in respect, compassion, understanding and inclusion. We expect all community members to act in accordance with these values. Fostering the free exchange of ideas requires building a conference that welcomes people of all backgrounds. Diversity of opinion and background is a fundamental strength of our community. The members of our community must have the freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas. Toward that goal, ACM CSCW conferences aim to create spaces where every participant can express themselves without fear of judgement or harassment.  \n The ACM CSCW Codes of Conduct guides the expected, professional behavior of conference participants, including:  \n Treating everyone with respect and consideration; under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person and online. \n  Communicating openly and thoughtfully with others and being considerate of the multitude of views and opinions that may be different than your own. \n  Being respectful and mindful in your critique of ideas. \n  Being mindful of your fellow participants. \n  Respecting participants wishes to not be photographed, respecting their gender pronouns, respecting their space, and their right to engage or disengage in conversation. \n  We believe disagreement and differences of opinion are a natural part of social and academic life and are important to work through when building community and learning from one another. At the same time, we acknowledge that societal power structures are even more challenging in academia, which is an inherently hierarchical community. In order to foster an environment of inclusion, we do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or abuse in any form. Participants who engage in harassment may be removed from the conference at the discretion of the organizers.  \n Harassment includes, but is not limited to:  \n Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices \n  Deliberate intimidation or antagonism \n  Exclusionary jokes or comments \n  Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact \n  Sustained disruption of presentations, events, or online discussion \n  Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease \n  Comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion) \n  Threats of violence. \n\n Copyright © 2024 CSCW 2025 | Powered by Astra WordPress Theme   \n\n    Scroll to Top"

Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  \n OOPSLA 2025 will have two rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline October 15, 2024  and Round 2 submission deadline March 25, 2025  (AoE). All deadlines are firm. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.  \n What’s New   \n There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:  \n Reserve Reviewer Policy \n  Data-Availability Statement \n  Contact   \n You can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email:  \n oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com    Please use this address, not  their personal email addresses, unless  you think they are not getting your messages. Please allow 1–2 working days for a response before assuming they didn’t see your message, and longer right around deadlines.  \n In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one). That makes it easier to track the context (and avoids ambiguity).  \n Review Process   \n PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.  \n At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:  \n Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  \n Reject  : Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.  \n Conditional Accept  : While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.  \n Minor Revision  : While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.  \n Major Revision  : While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.  \n If you receive one of the latter three decisions, please note:  \n If you choose to submit a revised paper, you must also submit both (a) a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and (b) unless impossible, a diff of the PDFs. Independent of the decision, you can submit at the next deadline (either the opening deadline of the next round or the revision deadline of the current round). To the extent possible, your submission will be reviewed by the same reviewers. \n  Unless you explicitly withdraw your paper, it is considered under review  . Therefore, it would violate policy to submit it elsewhere. If you choose to withdraw the paper (e.g., to submit elsewhere), the next time you submit it, it will be treated as a fresh paper: you may get entirely different reviewers, previous reviews and comments will not be available, etc. \n  Until your paper is accepted or rejected, you should maintain the anonymity of your submission. If you believe you need to violate it to respond to the reviews, please first discuss this with the Chairs. \n  If the Artifact Evaluation submission deadline occurs before the decision date, you will be invited to submit artifacts. However, acceptance of artifacts has no impact on the acceptance of the revised papers. \n  Reserve Reviewer Policy   \n To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS  .  \n Instructions  : Log into TPMS with the same email address as for your HotCRP account. The system will ask you to upload (or provide URLs for) 5-10 of your previous papers, to base your matching on. Uploading papers/URLs is pretty straightforward; here’s also a step-by-step video  . You get to choose which papers you want to upload; these determine what papers you are most likely to be asked to review. So please go for both depth and breadth. In particular, please provide papers on topics for which you are a relatively rare expert.  \n  \n The goal of this policy is to uphold the high standard of reviews within the SIGPLAN community. To achieve this, we must ensure manageable review loads, prevent burnout, and encourage reviewers to stay engaged for future rounds. High-quality reviews are one of the community’s greatest assets, playing a crucial role in elevating the quality of research for everyone.  \n Our hope is that these reserve reviewers won’t be needed at all! They will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our projections fall significantly short. Even in that case, their review load will be far lighter than that of RC members, and we will do our best to assign papers that closely match expertise (hence the need for TPMS registration).  \n We define “senior” authors as those who completed their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer policy if:  \n The paper has no senior authors. \n  At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference. \n  Every | senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria: | is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before); \n  is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year; \n  has some other exceptional circumstance that didn’t prevent writing the paper but prevents doing any reviewing. This must be cleared at least three days before submission with the RC Chairs. \n  It is okay for one person to serve as the reserve reviewer for more than one paper. Please enter their information for each such paper (preferably identically).  \n Submissions   \n Template   \n SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the SIGPLAN author information  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  \n Page Limit   \n Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material (such as appendices). However, papers must be self-contained; reviewers are under no obligation to read the supplementary material.  \n Revisions can go up to a maximum of 25 pages  . This includes papers given a minor or major revision in 2024, as well as the final, camera-ready papers. For fairness, there will not be an option to purchase additional pages. For the final paper, we ask you to stick as closely as possible to the final version accepted by reviewers, and only add material that reviewers requested.  \n Anonymity   \n PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must  \n omit author names and institutions, \n  use the third person when referencing your work, \n  anonymize supplementary material. \n  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  \n Novelty   \n Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy  . Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  \n Data-Availability Statement   \n To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled Data-Availability Statement  in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit, but please limit it to at most a few paragraphs (usually one paragraph suffices).  \n In it, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section should ideally also include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on that reviewers may find useful (but are not obliged to follow). The statement is not meant to be a detailed description of how to use  the artifact; that should accompany the artifact itself.  \n It is understood that some papers have no artifacts but, given the broad range of what constitutes an artifact, it would be helpful to readers to explain why the paper has none.  \n Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain why they did not do so.  \n Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper.  \n Procedure   \n Please submit using HotCRP  .  \n Publication   \n PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.  \n The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than April 1, 2025, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than October 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n ACM Policies   \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID iD  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has made a commitment to collecting ORCID iDs from all of our published authors  . ORCID iDs help improve author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID iD will help in these efforts.  \n The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  \n Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process \n  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors \n  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship \n  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details \n  You can find the updated policy here  .  \n FAQ   \n What are reviewers looking for?   \n We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  \n Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  \n Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  \n Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, and anecdotes.  \n Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology, and results clearly.  \n How are papers from previous years handled?   \n We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we try to assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) we strongly discourage reviewers from giving another “major revision” decision.  \n Are artifacts required?   \n No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the nature of the paper’s content and claims suggest there ought to be an artifact, authors must explain why they will not be providing one. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.  \n Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?   \n Yes. Sometimes artifacts are rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the research results (e.g., packaging issues).  \n What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   \n Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity completely undiscoverable (e.g., if a reviewer does a Web search for the text of your paper) but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without knowing who you are. This includes omitting your names from your title page, and referring to your own work in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]”, you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. It is best to suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.  \n Should I change the name of my system?   \n No. However, if it is not a new system and is likely to be known to others, you should refer to it as if it were created by a third party, rather than as your own creation.  \n My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   \n Cite the code in your paper, but replace the URL with text like “link removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  \n I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper. Should I anonymize reference to that work?   \n Yes, you should treat it like any other anonymization. But you should also change the title of the paper to break a direct link between the two.  \n Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?   \n We want to help you navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs. When in doubt about any of these guidelines, please first check in with the Review Committee Chairs: better safe than sorry. (If the Chairs give you permission, they can then also address any subsequent complaints about those actions from reviewers.)  \n Things you may  do:  \n Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites. \n  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. \n  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. \n  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. \n  Things you should not  do  :  \n Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. \n  Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings. For example, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post with paper details to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. \n  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. \n\n Important Dates   AoE (UTC-12h)     \n\n Tue 3 - Fri 6 Dec 2024  \n  Author Response R1 \n Wed 18 Dec 2024  \n  Author Notification R1 \n Tue 4 Feb 2025  \n  Submission of Revisions R1 \n Tue 18 Feb 2025  \n  Author Notification of Revisions R1 \n Fri 28 Feb 2025  \n  Camera Ready R1 \n Tue 25 Mar 2025  \n  Submission R2 \n Tue 15 Oct 2024   \n  Submission R1 \n\n OOPSLA Review Committee    \n   \n Shriram Krishnamurthi Co-chair    \n Brown University   \n United States \n  Sukyoung Ryu Co-chair    \n KAIST   \n South Korea \n  Işıl Dillig Associate Chair    \n University of Texas at Austin   \n United States \n  Sebastian Erdweg Associate Chair    \n JGU Mainz   \n Germany \n  Matthias Hauswirth Associate Chair    \n USI Lugano   \n Switzerland \n  Zhenjiang Hu Associate Chair    \n Peking University   \n China \n  Limin Jia Associate Chair    \n Carnegie Mellon University \n  Alexandra Silva Associate Chair    \n Cornell University   \n United States \n  KC Sivaramakrishnan Associate Chair    \n Tarides; IIT Madras   \n India \n  Tobias Wrigstad Associate Chair    \n Uppsala University   \n Sweden \n  Coşku Acay Committee Member    \n Observe, Inc.   \n United States \n  Eddie Aftandilian Committee Member    \n GitHub Next   \n United States \n  Alejandro Aguirre Committee Member    \n Aarhus University   \n Denmark \n  Dalal Alrajeh Committee Member    \n Imperial College London   \n United Kingdom \n  Dan Barowy Committee Member    \n Williams College   \n United States \n  Guillaume Baudart Committee Member    \n Inria   \n France \n  Rohan Bavishi Committee Member    \n Amazon   \n United States \n  Julia Belyakova Committee Member    \n Purdue University   \n United States \n  Dorra Ben Khalifa Committee Member    \n University of Toulouse - ENAC   \n France \n  Jasmin Blanchette Committee Member    \n Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München   \n Germany \n  Joanna C.

This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The new SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field.   \n ACM SenSys 2025  will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, but retaining the current SenSys name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) due to the time required for institutional approvals. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. We are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.   \n\n Latest News  \n 11/07/2024    \n Abstract registration is now optional.     \n\n Abstract registration before paper submission is now optional.

Submissions must be prepared using the following ACM proceedings template and must use US Letter page size (215.9 x 279.4 mm / 8.5 x 11 inches):  \n The ACM proceedings template for LaTeX can be found at | Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - SIG Proceedings Template | . \n  Please look at | ACM Primary Article Template | for further information on ACM proceedings templates. \n  Full, short, and SoK papers  \n Full paper submissions to ACM WiSec 2025 can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind reviewing.  \n Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches.  \n In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  \n Posters and demos  \n WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  \n Artifact Evaluation label  \n In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.  \n Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  \n Double submissions  \n It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed.  \n Workshops and Tutorial  \n ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.  \n Research Ethics  \n Ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices were not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no “one size fits all” approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication.  \n While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm.  \n Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as “human subjects.” For WiSec, “human subject research” is defined as “research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans.” Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met.  \n Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advances tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties  \n Policy for Peer-Review Integrity  \n All SIGSAC sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities ( https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment  ) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ( https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)  . Also all authors, PC members and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc)  . Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations)  . If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.  \n\n Follow us  \n  @acm_wisec    \n   \n Important Dates  \n First Cycle deadline | Submission: Nov 21, 2024 \n  Author Notification: Jan 15, 2025 \n  Camera-ready: Feb 05, 2025 \n  Second Cycle deadline | Submission: Mar 12, 2025 \n  Author Notification: Apr 23, 2025 \n  Camera-ready: May 12, 2025 \n  Posters/Demo | Submission: Early May 2025 \n  Notifications: Mid-May 2025 \n  Camera-Ready: Late May 2025 \n\n Sponsored by  \n\n Past Conferences  \n WiSec 2024 | / | WiseML 2024 \n  WiSec 2023 | / | WiseML 2023 \n  WiSec 2022 | / | WiseML 2022 \n  WiSec 2021 | / | WiseML 2021 \n  WiSec 2020 | / | WiseML 2020 \n  WiSec 2019 | / | WiseML 2019 \n  WiSec 2018 \n  WiSec 2017 \n  WiSec 2016 \n  WiSec 2015 \n  WiSec 2014 \n  WiSec 2013 \n  WiSec 2012 \n  WiSec 2011 \n  WiSec 2010 \n  WiSec 2009 \n  WiSec 2008 \n\n ↑ \n  Home \n  Follow-Us \n\n Copyright © 2025 ACM"

The conference generally runs mid-day Thursday through mid-day Saturday. Calls for papers to this conference generally go out in February with papers being due in the Spring.  \n Published Papers  \n Average paper acceptance rate recently (2006-2010) has been 54%. Papers published in the Proceedings of the SIGITE Information Technology Education Conference  primarily address issues around teaching and learning (pedagogy) of IT but also have focused on traditional research. Authors consist of IT faculty, professionals, as well as graduate and undergraduate students.  \n Publication Archive   \n See our publication archive for past SIGITE conferences.   \n See Archive    \n\n Depending on the conference organizers, these conferences also sometimes have tours of local IT facilities (campus labs or local IT companies) and/or pre or post-conference workshops relating to IT or education.  \n Department Chairs Meeting  \n Preceding the conference, a special meeting is held for Department Chairs of IT academic departments within academic institutions. These IT Department Chairs’ meetings have been growing in popularity each year as they discuss issues related to leading academic IT departments.  \n Student Stipends  \n Travel stipends are available to undergraduate or graduate students whose papers are accepted for publication in the proceedings.  \n Upcoming Conferences  \n SIGITE 2013   \n  Central Florida  \n  Hosted by the University of South Florida  \n\n Recent Posts   \n\n March 4, 2024   \n SIGITE 2024 – 25nd Annual Conference on IT Education – Call for Papers    \n\n March 28, 2023   \n SIGITE 2023 – 24nd Annual Conference on IT Education: Call For Papers    \n\n September 11, 2022   \n SIGITE 2022 Event Schedule    \n\n Testimonials   \n Bryan Goda    \n United States Military Academy, Deputy Head, Dept of EE&CS   \n\n SIGITE has allowed me to meet educators in the IT community. Because of SIGITE, I was able to start an IT program from scratch and get it accredited in a 4 year span because of wealth of knowledge of its members and their willingness to help. It is also a great venue for my IT faculty to publish and present their accomplishments.    \n\n Dr. Amber Settle    \n Associate Professor, DePaul University   \n\n This past weekend I attended and presented at the SIGITE Conference located in Midland, Michigan. It was the second weekend in a row that I was going to be gone, and all of that in the middle of the quarter, so I wasn’t as enthusiastic going into it as I normally am about conferences. As it turns out it was the best conference experience I’ve had in a long time!   \n The sessions at the conference are scheduled so that each talk has a 45-minute slot, with 30 minutes for the presentation and 15 minutes for questions. In most of the sessions I attended, including my own, the questions were in fact intermixed with the presentation. And what a difference it makes to have more time and a more interactive environment. I got excellent feedback on my work and was able to provide a lot more background information than was on my slides because of the questions. The questions themselves were also terrific. I was impressed by the insight that the audience members had into the work. I also got good questions and offers for collaborations after the talk, but it was the interactive presentations that really had me hooked.   \n On top of that, I met friendly, intelligent, and insightful people during the breaks, meals, and the reception. I had some of the best conference conversations ever, and I’m hoping that I’ll get a chance to stay in touch with the people I met.  So overall, I highly recommend SIGITE as a conference. Next year it will be at West Point in New York, and they’ve promised private tours of things that even tourists don’t get to see. That combined with the lively and friendly experience make it don’t miss opportunity.    \n\n Dr. Yan Bai    \n Assistant Professor Institute of Technology University of Washington Tacoma   \n\n I attended SIGITE’10 held in midland, MI. I really enjoy every session I attended! The conference presenters at SIGITE’10 provide valuable information about the IT program, curricula, courses, and accreditation. Everything about IT education! In particular, I appreciate the opportunity to network IT educators from around the US, and learn many new ideas for laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of IT instruction in the areas of cyber security and information networking. I’m certainly looking forward to SIGITE’11.   \n\n Ryan Kazmerik    \n Undergraduate Student Mount Royal University, Calgary   \n\n I am really glad that my paper was accepted and I was able to present at SIGITE 2010 as it gave me a peak into the process of IT education. Often students sometimes think that courses topics and curriculum are picked out of a hat, but the topic I chose exposed me to the same tough problems that the IT community has been dealing with for years.   \n\n Lani Fraizer    \n Synergies in Sync | iWE Project Pepperdine University   \n\n SIGITE’s growing community of ACM faculty, alumni and students provided me with a strong resource of experts and enthusiasts who champion IT education. What I loved most about SIGITE is that the community and its officers are welcoming and keen on both national, as well as global issues regarding IT education.   \n\n Dr. Glenn Wilson    \n Associate Research Professor of Technology Director, Information and Innovation University of Maine   \n\n Having been a long-time member of ACM, I was curious about SIGITE, so I attended the conference in Midland, Michigan this fall. It was a wonderful experience in three aspects. First, and foremost, the quality of presentations and the professional camaraderie among presenters and members was excellent. Secondly, the keynote speaker, CIO of Dow Chemical, was exceptionally informative, particularly as regards the way Dow recruits and situates its IT new-hires. And finally, I felt quite welcome and quickly accepted as new member of SIGITE, and look forward to becoming more involved in this dynamic and high-quality SIG.   \n\n ←  →    \n\n About SIGITE   \n SIGITE is the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Information Technology Education.

Novel uses of AI models to aid in the design and programming of FPGAs. \n  Research submissions can be in either of two categories:  \n Regular | — at most 10 pages (excluding references), for a regular presentation at the conference. \n  Short | — at most 6 pages (excluding references), for a brief presentation. \n  A paper submitted as either regular or short will only be considered in that category and may include artifacts if desired (see below for more details on artifact submission and evaluation).  \n   \n Submission Process   \n Submissions of all types should be made in the form of an English language PDF file. Papers should use the sigconf ACM format template posted at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template/  . LaTeX users should use the format used in the sample-sigconf.pdf file under the Samples folder of the zipped master file (available through the LaTeX link). Microsoft Word users can download the file Interim layout.docx under the Word Authors section of the page. Abstract and paper submissions in PDF must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (Anywhere-on-Earth time zone).  \n Submissions will be considered for acceptance as regular or short papers. A paper submitted to the regular or short category will only be considered in that category. Regular or short submissions will also be considered for acceptance as a poster. Once a paper has been submitted, its authorship list is considered to be fixed and final.  \n By submitting articles to an ACM Publication, authors are hereby acknowledging that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of their paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n Authors should ensure that they and their co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  (https://orcid.org/register), so that they can complete the publishing process for accepted papers. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and ACM has recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of their published authors  (https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2023. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; authors’ ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n   \n Double Blind Policy   \n The FPGA Symposium uses a double-blind reviewing system. Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered. References to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person, in the same way one would reference work by others. If necessary to maintain anonymity, citations may be shown as “Removed for blind review,” but consider that this may impede a thorough review if the removed citation is crucial to understanding the submission. When necessary, authors should cite widely-available Open Source software website(s) without claiming ownership. Grant numbers and other government markings should also be blinded during the review process. Placing a preliminary version of the unpublished paper on arXiv is not disqualifying, but it is also not encouraged. Similarly, if a paper can be unblinded by active search, this is not considered to undermine the spirit of the double-blind review. However, there are resources to blind open-source repositories for review, including: https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github  .  \n If you have questions about how to meet these guidelines, please contact the program chair before the submission deadline.  \n   \n Reviewer Conflict Policy   \n During paper submission, all author(s) conflicts must be registered with all possible program committee members. Conflicts are defined as all relationships that would prevent a reviewer from objectively evaluating the submitted work. This includes, but is not limited to, having within the past 5 years, 1) co-authored a publication, or 2) shared a funding award, and 3) shared at least one institutional affiliation. Note: if a conflict is left undeclared or a nonexistent conflict is declared in an attempt to manipulate the review process, the submission may be rejected.  \n For more information about the ACM Conflict of Interest Policy, see: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest   \n   \n Originality of Submissions   \n Papers submitted are guaranteed by the authors to be unique manuscripts and not previously published, currently accepted or under consideration for acceptance at another venue. They cannot be substantially similar to any other current/future conference, journal, or workshop submission(s) unless the content appeared at a venue that does not have archived proceedings.  \n   \n Rebuttal Process   \n The conference review process includes a rebuttal phase for authors to provide an optional response to reviewers’ questions and comments. This information is considered during the final deliberation process.  \n   \n Author participation   \n For inclusion in the ACM digital library, at least one of the authors of each accepted submission is required to present the work. Accommodations will be made for the authors who face travel restrictions or unforeseen difficulties with travel (more instruction will be available after the camera-ready submission).  \n   \n Best Paper Award   \n Authors of this year’s best manuscripts will be eligible for the conference’s best paper awards. They will also be invited to extend their work for consideration in a special issue of ACM’s Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS).  \n   \n Artifact Evaluation   \n The conference will allow authors to submit accompanying artifacts for their paper submissions for evaluation. This process will allow ACM recognized badges to be associated with the final publication. The inclusion of artifacts with a submission is not required for a paper submission nor will any preference be given to submissions with artifacts over those without. Papers and artifacts will be subjected to separate and independent review processes. Artifact evaluation must NOT interfere with the double blind reviewing process of their accompanying papers, so all accompanying links in the paper to the artifacts should be blinded. All authors will be required at the time of paper submission to indicate if there will also be associated artifacts for evaluation. If artifacts will be included, a descriptor of their nature will be required.  \n For more information, see: https://isfpga.org/artifact-evaluation/   \n   \n Diversity and Inclusion   \n The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of the conference. The organizers aim and commit to providing a harassment-free accessible and pleasant conference experience with equity in rights for all. We want every participant to feel welcome, included and safe at the conference.  \n For more information, see: https://isfpga.org/statement-on-diversity-and-inclusion/   \n   \n Important Dates   \n All submission deadlines are with respect to 11:59 pm Anywhere on Earth (UTC -12)    \n  \n Abstracts Due (All Papers) | October 1, 2024 (No Extensions) \n Submissions Due (All Papers) | October 8, 2024  (No Extensions) \n Rebuttal Period (All Papers) | November 11 – November 18, 2024 \n Notification of Acceptance (All Papers) | November 30, 2024 \n Camera-Ready Submission Due | December 31, 2024 \n Conference | February 27 - March 1, 2025 \n\n Visa Application   \n Prospective authors and participants requiring a B-2 visa to enter the US should check the visa appointment wait time using this link: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html  , and consider applying IMMEDIATELY for a visa, scheduling an appointment in December 2024. By then, notification of acceptance will have been sent out (if applicable), registrations will have been opened, and ACM will be able to deliver letters of support. To the best of our knowledge, the letter of support will never be required before the interview.  \n   \n Organizing Committee   \n  \n General Chair | Andrew Putnam | Microsoft \n Program Chair | Jing Li | University of Pennsylvania \n Publications Chair | Grace Zgheib | Intel \n Finance Chair | Zhiru Zhang | Cornell University \n Workshop Chair | Dustin Richmond | UC Santa Cruz \n Publicity and Website Chair | Aman Arora | Arizona State University \n Artifact Evaluation Co-Chair | Miriam Leeser | Northeastern University \n Artifact Evaluation Co-Chair | Suhaib Fahmy | KAUST \n Artifact Evaluation Co-Chair | Sitao Huang | UC Irvine \n\n © All right reserved  \n Event Star by Acme Themes    \n\n ×"

Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modelling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.  \n OOPSLA 2024 will have two separate rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline on the 20th of October 2023  (note that SPLASH/OOPSLA 2023  is 22-27 October 2023) and the Round 2 submission deadline on the 5th of April 2024 (Anywhere on Earth)   .  \n In each round, papers will have a final outcome of Accept, Revise, or Reject—see Review Process for details. Papers accepted at either of the rounds will be published in the 2023 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to be presented at the SPLASH conference in October 2024.  \n Review Process   \n PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing with submission deadlines around October and April each year. As you submit your paper you will receive around three reviews and an opportunity to provide an author response that will be read and addressed by the reviewers in the final decision outcome summary. There are 5 possible outcomes at the end of the round:  \n Accept  : Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).  \n Conditional Accept  : You will receive a list of required revisions that you will need to address. You must submit a revised paper, a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and — if possible — a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. Assuming you meet the listed requirements, after further review by the same reviewers, your paper will very likely be accepted. This process has to be completed within two months of the initial decision  for the paper to be accepted, so we encourage timely turnaround in case revisions take more than one cycle to be accepted. Please note that when resubmitting the paper for a conditional accept review it should remain anonymous until fully accepted.  \n Minor Revision  : The reviewers have concerns that go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Therefore, while you may receive a list of revisions suggested by the reviewers, this will not necessarily be comprehensive. You will have the opportunity to resubmit your revised paper and have it re-reviewed by the same reviewers, which may or may not result in your paper’s acceptance. When you resubmit, you should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers, by including a document describing the changes and — if possible — a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. This process has to be completed within two months of the initial decision  for the paper to be accepted in the current round, so we encourage timely turnaround in case revisions take more than one cycle to be accepted. Please note that when resubmitting the paper for a minor revision review it should remain anonymous until fully accepted.  \n IMPORTANT NOTE FROM AEC:  A minor revision is also invited to submit the artefact in case the paper is accepted for this year’s publication. Note that AEC and OOPSLA RC are different sets of people, so the paper will remain blinded to the OOPSLA RC reviewers.  \n Major Revision  : You will receive a list of revisions suggested by the reviewers. Papers in this category are invited to submit a revision to the next round of submissions  with a specific set of expectations to be met. When you resubmit, you should clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers, by including a document describing the changes and — if possible — a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. The revised paper will be re-evaluated in the next round. Resubmitted papers will retain the same reviewers throughout the process to the extent possible. Please note that when resubmitting the paper for a major revision review in the next round it should remain anonymous.  \n IMPORTANT NOTE FROM SIGPLAN:  A major revision decision also says that the paper is considered under submission to OOPSLA and cannot be resubmitted elsewhere unless the paper is explicitly withdrawn from consideration for OOPSLA.  \n Reject  : Rejected papers will not be included in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Papers in this category are not guaranteed a review if resubmitted less than one year from the date of the original submission. A paper will be judged to be a resubmission if it is substantially similar to the original submission. The Chairs will decide whether or not a paper is a resubmission of the same work.  \n Submissions   \n Submitted papers (including resubmissions) must be at most 23 pages  using the template below. The references do not count towards this limit. No appendices are allowed on the main paper, instead, authors can upload supplementary material with no page or content restrictions, but reviewers may choose to ignore it. The PACMPL templates used for SPLASH (Microsoft Word and LaTeX) and the instructions for their use can be found on the SIGPLAN author information page  and the ACM Primary Article Template  pages.  \n As of late 2023, the ACM LaTeX Template was located here  with the relevant file in the samples folder and called sample-acmsmall.tex .  \n Papers may use either numeric or author-year citations. In LaTeX, use \\citestyle{acmauthoryear} to select author-year citations; nothing needs to be done to use numeric citations, which are the default.  \n PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must  \n omit author names and institutions, \n  use the third person when referencing your work, \n  anonymise supplementary material. \n  Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission; see the DBR FAQ. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  \n Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.  \n Artifacts   \n Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. Please note that the artifact submission deadline will be following closely the paper notification deadline so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper to PACMPL(OOPSLA).   \n Data-Availability Statement   \n To help readers find data and software, OOPSLA recommends adding a section just before the references titled Data-Availability Statement  . If the paper has an artifact, cite it here. If there is no artifact, this section can explain how to obtain relevant code. The statement does not count  toward the OOPSLA 2023 page limit. It may be included in the submitted paper, in fact we encourage this, even if the DOI is not ready yet.  \n Example:   \n \\section{Conclusion} .... \\section*{Data-Availability Statement} The software that supports~\\cref{s:design,s:evaluation} is available on Software Heritage~\\cite{artifact-swh} and Zenodo~\\cite{artifact-doi}. \\begin{acks} ....  Expert PC Members   \n During the submission, we will ask you to list up to 3 non-conflicted PC members who you think are experts on the topic of this submission, starting with the most expert. This list will not be used as an input during the paper assignment and it will not be visible to the PC. It may be used by the PC Chair and Associate Chairs for advice on external experts if the paper lacks expert reviews.  \n Publication   \n PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, all papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge ($400 USD), but payment is not required. The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library.  \n The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than the 1st of April 2024, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than the 1st of October 2024. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:  \n Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process \n  Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors \n  Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship \n  Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details \n  You can find the updated policy here:  \n https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship   \n Camera Ready Requirements   \n The page limit for the camera-ready version is 27 pages plus references  (note the 4-page increase compared to the reviewed version to accommodate any further changes requested by the reviewers), there are no page charges for this extension to 27 pages excluding references.  \n We prefer if the authors stay within the original reviewed 23 page limit as that was fully reviewed and go over the limit only if requested by the reviewers. We allow this increase to be applied to accepted papers, as well as conditionally accepted and minor revision papers as part of the resubmission. This increase does not normally apply to the major revisions.   \n FAQ   \n Selection Criteria   \n We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:  \n Novelty  : The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.  \n Importance  : The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.  \n Evidence  : The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.  \n Clarity  : The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.  \n Papers Resubmitted from previous year OOPSLA R2 to this year OOPSLA R1   \n Q: What process is followed for “major revisions” papers between different years? We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) getting another “major revision” is not an option given to the reviewers.  \n Artifacts   \n Q: Are artifacts required? No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. But if an artifact is not provided when the claims in the paper refer to an artifact, the authors must explain why their work is not available for repetition.  \n Q: Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected? Yes! The reasons for rejecting an artifact are multiple and often stem from the quality of the packaging.  \n Double-Blinding Submissions (Authors)   \n Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper? Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity.  \n Q: Should I change the name of my system? No.  \n Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this? Cite the code in your paper, but remove the URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.  \n Q: I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper, should I anonymize reference to that work? No. But we recommend you do not use the same title so that it clearly distinguishes the papers.  \n Q: Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv? send it to colleagues? give a talk about it? on social media? We have developed guidelines to help navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs.  \n Things you may do  :  \n Put your submission on your home page. \n  Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict. \n  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. \n  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc. \n  Things you should not do  :  \n Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. \n  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. \n  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Review Committee Chairs. \n\n Speakers and Session Chairs  \n   \n Session Chair Instructions   \n Please assemble in the room at least 15 minutes before the session starts, ensure that at least one presenter is present for each paper, and have at least one question ready for each paper in case there are none from the audience. We advise you to look at or read the papers in your session! Please get in touch with the RC chairs via email or other means if any of the presenters are missing 10 minutes before the start of the session.  \n Presenter/Speaker Instructions   \n Please be at the designated room 15 minutes before your entire session starts to check your AV equipment setup and introduce yourself to the session chair. Your slot is 20 minutes long, which means we expect your talk to last only 15 minutes and leave 5 minutes for Q&A chaired by the session chair.

The conference began as a series of symposia and workshops starting in 1993 with the aim of bringing together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners in relation to novel systems based on geospatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary discussions and research in all aspects of geographic information systems. The conference provides a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation aspects of geospatial data ranging from applications, user interfaces, and visualization to data storage and query processing and indexing. The conference is the premier annual event of the ACM Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (ACM SIGSPATIAL). Researchers, students, and practitioners are invited to submit their contributions to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024.  \n\n Latest News and Updates  \n  \n Oct. 08, 2024 | Poster and Demo Instructions have been posted here  . \n Oct. 05, 2024 | The 2nd SIGSPATIAL RUN:  A no-pressure, fun and networking event starts before the conference!

As an annual conference series starting in 2006, ACM ISS (formerly known as ACM ITS, International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces) is the premier venue for research addressing the design, development and use of new and emerging tabletop, digital surface, interactive spaces and multi-surface technologies. Over the years ISS has been a venue for research and applications of interactive surfaces as well as spaces, which has been acknowledged by the incorporation of 'Space' into our conference identity since 2016.  \n Interactive Surfaces and Spaces increasingly pervade our everyday life, appearing in various sizes, shapes, and application contexts, offering a rich variety of ways to interact.  \n The ISS steering committee members are looking forward to your contribution and participation at the ISS.  \n   \n Upcoming Event  \n    \n Past Events  \n\n Call for bids: Hosting future ISS Conferences  \n   \n We are soliciting expressions of interest for chairing and hosting the ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (formerly ACM Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces) conference in 2025 or 2026.  \n ISS is a successful ACM conference series that consistently attracts up to 200 attendees and high-quality paper submissions. It is celebrating its 19 th  edition in Vancouver, BC, Canada, from October 27-30, 2024 (see https://iss.acm.org/2024/  ).  \n As a first step before submitting a PDF with your bid, you might want to send us a lightweight expression of interest. If you are interested in hosting ISS we just need you to reply with an e-mail that indicates:  \n Main contact person (at least provisionally), and e-mail. \n  Possible geographical location (no need for detail at the moment—a hotel, city, or region is OK). \n  Which of 2025 or 2026 you are interested in organizing (it's okay to indicate one as a backup). \n  We welcome bids from teams hosting other conferences (i.e., we are open to co-location).  \n After your e-mail we will follow up about further details (e.g., putting together an organizing team), selecting dates, etc.  \n  Alternatively, you might also send us the complete bid directly as a PDF document with the content as indicated below.  \n In either case, please get back to us by responding to the ACM ISS steering committee ( steering@iss.acm.org  ).  \n   \n Bidding Process for ACM ISS  \n A call for bids for ACM ISS is issued by the SC Chair (typically, in November) and sent to all the members of the ACM ISS Program Committee and the wider ACM ISS community. Bids will continue to be accepted until the venues are decided. We will begin reviewing bids as they are received. As a formal bid, bidders should submit a single PDF document to the SC with the following information:  \n The proposal should address each aspect outlined below (approx. 5-6 pages). A PDF document providing further details on the content of the bid can be found here  .  Based on the merits of the proposals and when the proposals are submitted, the committee will choose the top candidates and then a finalist will be chosen and announced.   \n Location  \n Since ISS is an international forum, we expect that attendees travel from different parts of the world to the conference location. It is important that the proposed location is conveniently located for all attendees to reach by available means of transportation. Learning from experiences during the worldwide pandemic, we appreciate the inclusion of concepts for running hybrid conferences.  \n   \n Time  \n ISS conferences have been held at various times during around early / mid November. Your bid should include a proposed time within that range with key dates (e.g., paper submission and notification). The choice of time should also take into account the weather conditions of the proposed location to avoid potential weather-caused travel delays and potential conflicts with other conferences and their submission deadlines (e.g., CHI, CSCW and most importantly UIST).  \n   \n Venue  \n ISS officially includes four days with the workshops and tutorials on its first day, which need to be hosted in separate rooms (10-20 people) in parallel. To encourage interaction among the attendees, during the main conference, it is also desirable to have additional space at the venue to put up ISS posters for the attendees to visit during coffee breaks.  \n   \n Accommodation & Travel Costs  \n Most attendees will travel by plane and need accommodation during the conference period. One of the responsibilities of the conference hosts/organizers is to locate and reserve a bulk of affordable lodging for attendees. Please describe the proposed accommodation options, including the price range of the hotel rooms and the distance to the main venue and approximate travel costs, at the time of the conference from major centres in Europe, US, Asia/Pacific.  \n   \n Provisionary Budget Plan  \n The proposal should also include a provisional budget plan, outlining the cost of major items, including the rental of conference venue, cost/per person for the reception and banquet, and the estimated conference registration fee. Please consider including meals for participants into the budget.  \n   \n Hosts/Organizers  \n Conference hosts/organizers should have knowledge of the ISS community (e.g., having attended and published regularly at ISS) and have experience with conference organization. One of the main ISS goals is to bring together people from diverse backgrounds. So ensuring the diversity of the organizing committee is highly encouraged and preferred. Please include short bios of the key hosts/organizers and roles of individuals, including the conference chair(s). Note that ISS uses the PACM HCI journal model of publishing, so Track Chairs are selected separately and are involved in the editorial process across multiple years, though we welcome suggestions.  \n\n The SC will attempt to balance the location of accepted bids to reflect the interests , diversity and geographical location of the community.  \n\n Mission Statement  \n The ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS) Steering Committee promotes and maintains the ACM ISS conference as the premiere venue for researchers and practitioners interested in the design, development and use of new and emerging tabletop, digital surface, and multi-surface technologies as well as interactive spaces.  \n   \n Contact  \n For any questions or early expressions of interest for hosting a future conference please send an email to the following address:  \n Steering Committee | (steering@iss.acm.org) \n\n Structure and People  \n   \n The steering committee (SC) consists of six (6) to eight (8) long-time ISS community members who have strong engagement with the ISS community and have been invited to serve on the committee. Members normally serve on the SC for five (5) years. The SC is lead by a Chair, who is elected by the SC. An outgoing Chair may also advise the Chair to help with knowledge transfer. The SC should represent the diversity of the ISS community.  \n Current Steering Committee Members  \n   \n  Chair  \n Mark Hancock   \n University of Waterloo  \n\n  Member  \n Craig Anslow   \n Victoria University of Wellington  \n\n  Member  \n Jessica Cauchard   \n Ben Gurion University of the Negev  \n\n  Member  \n Eve Hoggan   \n Aarhus University  \n\n  Member  \n Hideki Koike   \n Tokyo Institute of Technology  \n\n  Member  \n Bongshin Lee   \n Microsoft Research  \n\n  Member  \n Anne Roudaut   \n University of Bristol  \n\n  Member  \n Edward Tse   \n NUITEQ  \n\n   Meeting of the ISS steering committee at ACM CHI 2018 in Montreal   \n   \n Former Steering Committee Members (Alumni)  \n Raimund Dachselt | , Technische Universität Dresden \n  Miguel Nacenta | , University of Victoria \n  Johannes Schöning | , University of Bremen \n  Stacey Scott | , University of Guelph \n  Sheelagh Carpendale | , University of Calgary \n  Judy Kay | , University of Sydney \n  Sriram Subramanian | , University of Sussex \n  Andy Wilson | , Microsoft Research \n  Shahram Izadi | , PerceptiveIO Inc. \n  Gerald Morrison | , SMART Technologies UCLC \n  Chia Shen | , Harvard University \n  Bruce Thomas | , University of South Australia \n\n Tasks and Duties  \n Steering Committee Responsibilities  \n The ISS Steering committee is responsible for:  \n soliciting bids for people interested in organizing a future ISS conference and continuity of the conference, \n  making the decision on where the ISS conference is held every year, \n  providing advice to and communicating with each year's ISS conference chairs, \n  developing the spirit and general direction of ISS and specifically the financial sustainability, the publication model and diversity of the conference. \n  ensuring the highest quality for the program of the conference, \n  promoting the ISS conference series to academia, industry and the public, \n  participating in the 10-year best paper selection process, \n  interfacing to ACM SIGCHI and other HCI sister conferences. \n    \n Steering Committee Duties  \n Members of the SC are expected to attend the annual ACM ISS Steering Committee meeting during the annual conference (in person ideally but via video conference in lieu of this). In addition SC members are expected to take part in the three-monthly video conferences. A member of the SC is expected to be actively involved in the conference series which can include, attending the annual conference, submitting papers, organising workshops, running tutorials, contributing to the SC discussion and decision process and attending SC meetings.  \n\n Membership  \n How to become an ACM ISS SC member?  \n The SC will invite future members, by choosing among the past general and program chairs of the ISS conference and people involved in ACM ISS over several years. The SC is expected to have less than 8 members and more than 6. People will drop of the SC after a maximum period of 5 years. Membership of a SC member terminates when (s)he is frequently inactive. Along with participation, the SC mailing list serves as an archive of members' activities and should be reported on by the chair of the SC at the start of each annual steering committee meeting.  \n Steering Committee Chair  \n From January of 2018 the term as SC Chair lasts two years. The SC chair is chosen among members of the SC, following a vote.  \n   \n SC Decision Process  \n Any SC member can raise an issue by sending an e-mail to the list of all SC members. Every SC member must reply to the mail on the list, describing her/his position within 10 days. If no consensus is apparent, the chair calls for a formal vote (Plurality voting) by email. Every SC member must reply sending her/his vote on the list within a week. A SC member is conflicted with voting for a bid to host a conference, if the SC member is general or program chair of the proposed bid. The member can talk part in the discussion, but it not allowed to vote.  \n\n Award Process  \n 10-year Impact Award Selection Process  \n The program chairs of the current year make the selection of the TOP 3-5 papers of the conference and select the 10-years impact award. One program chair assembles the jury and starts the discussion within the jury. The jury typically consists of:  \n 1x PC chair of conference year-1 year \n  2x PC chair of conference year-10 years \n  1x SC member \n  1x ITS \"Senior member\" of the community \n\n ISS Conference Series  \n   \n ISS 2023: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, November 6-8, 2023 \n  ISS 2022: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Wellington, Aotearoa, New Zealand, November 20-23, 2022 \n  ISS 2021: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Łódź, Poland, November 14-17, 2021 \n  ISS 2020: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Lisbon, Portugal, November 8-11, 2020 \n  ISS 2019: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Daejeon, South Korea, November 10-13, 2019 \n  ISS 2018: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Tokyo, Japan, November 25-28, 2018 \n  ISS 2017: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n in Brighton, UK, October 17-20, 2017 \n  ISS 2016: ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces   \n Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, November 6-9, 2016 \n  ITS 2015: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, November 15-18, 2015 \n  ITS 2014: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Dresden, Germany, November 16-19, 2014 \n  ITS 2013: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in St. Andrews, Scotland, October 6-9, 2013 \n  ITS 2012: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Cambridge, MA, USA, November 11-14, 2012 \n  ITS 2011: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Kobe, Japan, November 13-16, 2011 \n  ITS 2010: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Saarbrücken, Germany, November 7-10, 2010 \n  ITS 2009: ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces   \n in Banff, Canada, November 23-25, 2009 \n  TABLETOP 2008: IEEE Tabletops and Interactive Surfaces Workshop 2008   \n in Amsterdam, Netherlands, October 1-3, 2008 \n  TABLETOP 2007: 2nd IEEE Tabletop Workshop 2007   \n in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, October 10-12, 2007 \n  TABLETOP 2006: 1st IEEE Tabletop Workshop 2006   \n in Adelaide, Australia, January 5-7, 2006 \n\n iss.acm.org  ⋅ Website created by the Interactive Media Lab Dresden  and maintained by the ISS steering committee  ."

We recently published an article that reviews the series of GeoAI workshops held at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL) since 2017. These workshops have provided researchers a forum to present GeoAI advances covering a wide range of topics, such as geospatial image processing, transportation modeling, public health, and digital humanities. We provide a summary of these topics and the research articles presented at the 2017, 2018, and 2019 GeoAI workshops.

Since 1992, it has successfully brought together leading researchers and developers from the three communities, with the purpose of identifying challenging problems facing the development of advanced knowledge and information systems, and shaping future research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings.  \n It provides an international forum for presentation and discussion of research on information and knowledge management, as well as recent advances on data and knowledge bases. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future directions of research by soliciting and reviewing high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. An important part of the conference is the Workshops program which focuses on timely research challenges and initiatives.  \n Student Travel Endowment: The goal of the CIKM Student Travel Endowment is to help young people become part of the CIKM community by providing funds to support student travel, especially when those students are the authors of accepted papers.  \n Conference History:  \n The 36th CIKM 2027 will be held in Sydney, Australia  \n (TBC) 35th CIKM 2026, October 26-30, 2026, Rome, Italy  \n 34th ACM International CIKM 2025, November 10-14, 2025, Seoul, South Korea  \n (Organizer: TBD)  \n Conference Program TBD  \n 33rd ACM International CIKM 2024, October 21-25, 2024, Boise, ID, USA  \n (Organizer: Boise State University, College of Engineering, Computer Science Department)  \n Pre-conference Tutorials:  \n  Systems for Scalable Graph Analytics and Machine Learning  \n  Fairness in Large Language Models: Recent Advances and Future  \n  Unifying Graph Neural Networks across Spatial and Spectral Domains  \n  Tabular Data-centric AI: Challenges, Techniques and Future Perspectives  \n  Frontiers of Large Language Model-Based Agentic Systems  \n  Hands-On Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning  \n  On the Use of Large Language Models for Table Tasks  \n  Data Quality-aware Graph Machine Learning  \n  Towards Efficient Temporal Graph Learning: Algorithms, Frameworks, and Tools  \n  Landing Generative AI in Industrial Social and E-commerce Recsys  \n  Transforming Digital Forensics with Large Language Models  \n  Collecting and Analyzing Public Data from Mastodon  \n Post-conference Workshops:  \n  AI Agent for Information Retrieval  \n  DCAI: The 4th International Workshop on Data-Centric AI  \n  GenAI and RAG Systems for Enterprise  \n  Knowledge Graphs for Responsible AI  \n  LLMs Beyond The Cutoff 2024 Workshop – 1st International Workshop on Computational Methods Beyond the Temporal Borders of Training Data  \n  1st Workshop on Multimodal Search and Recommendations (CIKM MMSR ‘24)  \n  3rd International Workshop on Industrial Recommendation Systems  \n  4th International Workshop on Online and Adaptive Recommender Systems  \n  8th Workshop on Graph Techniques for Adversarial Activity Analytics (GTA³ 2024)  \n  Trustworthy and Responsible AI for Information and Knowledge Management System  \n  Workshop on Generative AI for E-Commerce  \n AnalytiCup Competition: AI Aided Advanced Aerodynamics-Streamlining Automobile Design for Optimal Performance  \n  Industry Day  \n  PhD Symposium  \n Sessions:  \n  Search and Retrieval  \n  Recommendation  \n  Anomaly Detection  \n  Explainability  \n  Graph Recommendation  \n  Performance  \n  Biomedical & Health  \n  Urban Systems  \n  Large Language Models  \n  Knowledge Graphs  \n  Graph Data Mining  \n  Neural Recommendation  \n  Misinformation  \n  Time Series Data  \n  Content Understanding  \n  Stream Data  \n  Search and Retrieval  \n  Recommender Systems  \n  Social Networks  \n  Medical Domain  \n  Privacy, News, Specialized Applications  \n  Graphs  \n  Forecasting, Spatial and Temporal  \n  Knowledge Discovery  \n  Fairness  \n  Natural Language Processing  \n  Computer Vision  \n  Federated Learning  \n  Detection  \n  Reinforcement Learning Optimization  \n  Conversational Interactions  \n  IR & LLM  \n  Question Answering  \n  FP:  \n  Data Quality  \n  Users & Behaviors  \n  Data Mining  \n  Prediction  \n  Machine Learning & AI  \n  Databases  \n  Privacy & Security  \n  Multimodal Dataset Curation and Knowledge Representation  \n  CTR & Ads  \n  Vision & Others  \n  Personalization  \n  LLMs  \n  Spatio-Temporal Data  \n  Graph Learning  \n  Systems & Privacy  \n  LLMs, Contrastive Learning, & Others  \n  Transfer Learning  \n  Graph Neural Networks  \n  Knowledge Representation  \n  Data Retrieval, matching & prediction  \n  Robust & Resilient AI  \n  AI-driven approaches  \n  LLMs applications & Sentiment Analysis  \n Keynotes:  \n  Traversing the Journey of Data and AI: From Convergence to Translation  \n  Is the Search Engine of the Future a Chatbot?  \n  Ensembles for Outlier Detection and Evaluation  \n  \n 32nd ACM International CIKM 2023, October 21-25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom  \n (Organizer: University of Wolverhampton, School of Engineering, Computing and Mathematical Sciences;

All accepted long papers will also be presented in the ACM CoNEXT 2024 conference. This is a new model that strives to combine the benefits of both conference and journal based publication. We especially encourage submissions that present novel experimentation, creative use of networking technologies, and new insights made possible using analysis. We invite submissions on a wide range of networking topics. The list of topics includes (in alphabetical order): Content distribution and caching, e.g., CDN, peer-to-peer, overlays Design, analysis, and evaluation of network architectures Energy-efficient computing and networking Experience and lessons learned by deploying large-scale networked systems In-network computing, NFV and network programmability Innovative uses of network data beyond communication Network measurements and modeling Internet economics and policy Mobile and wireless network protocols and applications Machine learning as applied to all layers of networking Networked applications including web, video, and online social networks Network aspects of datacenters, cloud computing, operating systems, virtualization Network aspects of IoT Network control and management, including SDN Network, transport, and application-layer protocols Reliability and availability of networks, protocols, and applications Reproducibility of networking research Routing and traffic engineering Security and privacy aspects of network applications and protocols We are open to other contributions that stretch networking research outside of these topics, present new emerging computing trends, or potentially involve unfamiliar techniques. We emphasize that the focus of CoNEXT is networking and its impact on networked applications. For example, papers focusing on the wireless physical layer without considering the impact on the network (e.g., quantitative performance benefits, deployment challenges) are out of scope. Potential authors who are unsure of the scope are encouraged to contact the PC chairs before submission. The CoNEXT conference will present all papers that have been accepted to appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Networking (PAMCNET), as well as short papers submitted to the conference. There are two deadlines to submit your work in time for a presentation at the conference (see below).

A paper should either be submitted to the Research Track or the Applied Data Science Track but not    both.  \n KDD has multiple submission cycles per year  . KDD 2025 will have two deadlines, one on August 1, 2024 and another on February 1, 2025 (with full paper deadlines a week after the abstract submission deadlines). Likewise, the KDD Proceedings will have two installments. Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  \n The conference will take place in Toronto, Canada, expected in August 2025.  \n Important Dates   \n Abstract Deadline: Aug 1, 2024 \n  Paper Deadline: Aug 8, 2024 \n  Author Rebuttal Period: Oct 4-18, 2024 \n  Notification: Nov 16, 2024 \n  Camera-ready: Dec 19, 2024 \n  Conference: TBD \n  All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE)  time zone.  \n Submission Site   \n We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.  \n All listed authors must  have an up-to-date  OpenReview profile. Here is information on how to create  an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:  \n New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that | can take up to two weeks | . \n  New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. \n  The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Incomplete OpenReview profile is sufficient ground for desk rejection. To be considered complete  , each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory  fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP, ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications. In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be indicated wherever applicable.  \n Abstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview  .  \n   \n  Scope   \n   \n  For the research track, we invite submission of papers describing innovative research on all aspects of knowledge discovery and data science, ranging from theoretical foundations to novel models and algorithms for data science problems in science, business, medicine, and engineering. Visionary papers on new and emerging topics are also welcome, as are application-oriented papers that make innovative technical contributions to research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  \n Data Science: | Methods for analyzing social networks, time series, sequences, streams, text, web, graphs, rules, patterns, logs, IoT data, spatio-temporal data, biological data, scientific and business data; recommender systems, computational advertising, multimedia, finance, bioinformatics. \n  Big Data: | Large-scale systems for data analysis, machine learning, optimization, sampling, summarization; parallel and distributed data science (cloud, map-reduce, federated learning); novel algorithmic and statistical techniques for big data; algorithmically-efficient data transformation and integration. \n  Foundations: | Models and algorithms, asymptotic analysis; model selection, dimensionality reduction, relational/structured learning, matrix and tensor methods, probabilistic and statistical methods; deep learning, transfer learning, representation learning, meta learning, reinforcement learning; classification, clustering, regression, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, few shot learning and unsupervised learning; personalization, security and privacy, visualization; fairness, interpretability, ethics and robustness. \n  Submission Guidelines  \n Deadlines  . The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder or dummy abstracts are forbidden.  \n Authorship  . The ACM has an authorship policy  stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools  . Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper. Any use of generative AI tools must be disclosed and elaborated in the submission form.  \n Maximum authorship. In the research track, the number of submissions allowed per author is limited to | 7 | (seven) | maximum. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 7 by submission id, will be desk-rejected. \n  Authorship changes. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized | by submission deadline | . There | cannot | be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation. \n  Anonymity  . The review process will be double-blind  . The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to refer to your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools.  \n Formatting Requirements  . Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format  (also available  in Overleaf); Word users may use the Word Interim Template. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:  \n \\documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}   Submissions must be a single  PDF file: 8  (eight)  content pages as main paper, followed by references and an optional Appendix that has no page limits. The Appendix can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc. The first 8 pages should be self-contained  , since reviewers are not required to read past that. Note that different limits will apply to camera-ready (see below).  \n Originality and Concurrent Submissions  . Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification  that applies to all publications.  \n Resubmission Guidelines  . A paper that receives a Resubmit  decision during the Feb 2024 submission cycle may submit a revised version to the Aug 2024 deadline. A paper that was rejected during the Feb 2024 deadline could not  submit a revision, and could not  be re-submitted as a fresh submission to the Aug 2024 deadline. Please also refer to the FAQ for Resubmission  .  \n Resubmission must be indicated upon submission, along with the OpenReview forum id  of the previous submission. The resubmission should also include a summary of changes (limited to 5000 characters) in the submission form. The reviewers/AC/SAC will have visibility of the previous submission and reviews. We anticipate that Resubmit  papers that address the previously noted concerns appropriately would have a higher acceptance rate than fresh submissions, owing to the former’s selectivity and potential improvements.  \n Correspondingly, some of the fresh submissions to the Aug 2024 deadline may receive a Resubmit  decision for Feb 2025 deadline.  \n Serving as Reviewer  . To ensure that all papers receive a sufficient number of high quality reviewers, every submission must nominate at least one author who is a qualified reviewer (i.e., authors with at least three papers in KDD or other related conferences). Being named as a reviewer in the submission constitutes an acceptance and a commitment to carry out the regular reviewing load responsibly. Only if no qualified reviewer exists in the author list, nominate the best-qualified author for consideration by the PC chairs. Failure to provide a qualified reviewer when one exists in the author list, or failure to carry out the assigned reviewing duty properly, is sufficient ground for desk rejection.  \n Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent  . Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies.  \n Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. Note that submitting your research for approval by such may not always be sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by your IRB, the program committee might raise additional concerns about the ethical implications of the work and include these concerns in its review.  \n Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.   \n Reviewing Process  \n Reviewing  . Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews, overseen by an Area Chair (AC). At least one author per submission must commit to be a reviewer, carry the regular load, and submit all their reviews on time. If any author of a submission does not carry out the reviewing task in a proper  and timely  manner, no author of that submission will see the reviews of that submission during the rebuttal stage.  \n Any use of generative AI tools during the reviewing process must be disclosed in the review form. In particular, verbatim uploading of any passage from the paper being reviewed to any generative AI tool is forbidden.  \n Rebuttal  . Authors will have the chance to provide a response to each review during the rebuttal period. The ACs will consider the authors’ response to the points raised by the reviewers, as well as discussion among reviewers, to inform acceptance decisions.  \n Withdrawal  . Authors may request to withdraw their submissions only  during the rebuttal period. Such requests must be made in written form to the PC Chairs and are completed only upon their acknowledgment.  \n Decision  . A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.  \n Transparency  . By submitting paper(s) to KDD 2025, the authors agree that the original submission, reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.  \n Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy  \n All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. A domain conflict  (entered in Education & Career History) must be declared for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. A personal conflict  should be declared when the following associations exist:  \n candidate for employment at the same institution or company \n  co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months \n  active collaborator \n  family relationship or close personal relationship \n  graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation \n  deep personal animosity \n  In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere to ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy  as well as the ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  .  \n Any transgression that falls short of ethical standards will be investigated and may face disciplinary actions. Such transgressions include, but are not limited to, falsification, dual submission, collusion, pressuring any member of the program committee. Convicted misconduct may result in a 3-year ban from SIGKDD events for all  the authors.  \n Publication and Presentation Policies  \n Publication  . All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings ( 12  pages, of which 9  are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. That is, while we allow one more content page for accepted papers, we limit the references and Appendix to only 3 pages. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. The rights retained by authors who transfer copyright to ACM can be found here  . Authors of accepted papers from the August 2024 deadline must opt in for early publication  on the rights form in order for their papers to be included in the first installment.  \n Reproducibility  . Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. We are encouraging the (optional) use of the “Artifacts Available” badge in ACM’s Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.  \n Registration  . To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two multi-authored papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the specified deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.  \n Presentation  . Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.  \n Official Publication Date.  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date for KDD 2025 will be confirmed at a later stage. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n Program Committee Co-Chairs  \n Email: KDD25-pc-chairs@acm.org   \n   \n  Yizhou Sun  (University of California, Los Angeles)  \n  Flavio Chierichetti  (Sapienza University of Rome)  \n  Hady W.

RecSys brings together leading international research groups and industry experts, including many of the world’s top companies in e-commerce and related domains. It is the most important annual event for the discussion and advancement of recommender systems research.  \n RecSys 2025, the nineteenth conference in this series, will be held in Prague, Czech Republic. It will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their latest findings and identify new trends and challenges in providing recommendation components across a range of innovative application contexts. In addition to the main technical track, the RecSys 2025 program will feature keynote and invited talks, tutorials on state-of-the-art topics, workshops, an industrial track, and a doctoral symposium.  \n\n Statement on Inclusion and Safety  \n As the organizers of RecSys 2025, we are committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and respectful conference environment for all attendees. As we increasingly realize the impact of our community’s work on society, we appreciate now more than ever the importance of providing an inclusive and accessible conference that brings together a diverse recommender systems community.  \n  As an ACM conference, RecSys and its organizers, speakers, and attendees are bound by the ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment  , which applies to both the conference venue and social media. As organizers, this is a policy that we fully endorse.  \n  RecSys has made efforts over the last several years to be an accessible and inclusive community, across various perspectives, and we have sought throughout our planning of RecSys 2025 to continue and expand those efforts. The General Chairs (Maria Bielikova, Pavel Kordik, and Markus Schedl) welcome your input.  \n Accessibility and Inclusion at RecSys.  The RecSys conference values and cares about diversity, accessibility and inclusion. We have always been diverse in terms of disciplinary backgrounds (e.g. including both HCI- and data-focused work), professional affiliations (e.g. strong representation from both academia and industry), and application domains of our work. We are aware that members in our community may come from historically underrepresented groups, for which we wish to pro-actively encourage and support increased participation. To ensure the conference and its activities are accessible to all, we also explicitly seek to address the visible or invisible support needs members of our community may have.  \n Publications and Presentations.  RecSys hosts a variety of scientific discussions. Historically, we have prepared guidelines for accessible and inclusive presentations. We would like to emphasize that inclusive, safe and respectful addressing does not only apply to conference presentations, but also to the whole process leading towards these presentations, including the way in which research is presented and reviewed. We therefore would like to encourage our community members to already keep our best practice guidelines on inclusive language in mind, when preparing their manuscripts and peer reviewing.  \n Contact.  Should you experience or witness a violation of the anti-harassment policy, or have any other concerns regarding your ability to fully and safely participate in the conference, please email the RecSys General Chairs; you can also directly reach them at the conference venue.  \n We hope you have an amazing RecSys.  \n Maria Bielikova, Pavel Kordik, and Markus Schedl   \n\n RecSys 2025 (Prague)  \n About the Conference \n  Committees \n\n About this site  \n This site contains information about the ACM Recommender Systems community, the annual ACM RecSys conferences, and more.  \n\n RecSys 2025  \n About the Conference \n\n Shortcuts to Conferences RecSys 2025 (Prague) \n  RecSys 2024 (Bari) \n  RecSys 2023 (Singapore) \n  RecSys 2022 (Seattle) \n  RecSys 2021 (Amsterdam) \n  RecSys 2020 (Online) \n  RecSys 2019 (Copenhagen) \n  RecSys 2018 (Vancouver) \n  RecSys 2017 (Como) \n  RecSys 2016 (Boston) \n  RecSys 2015 (Vienna) \n  RecSys 2014 (Silicon Valley) \n  RecSys 2013 (Hong Kong) \n  RecSys 2012 (Dublin) \n  RecSys 2011 (Chicago) \n  RecSys 2010 (Barcelona) \n  RecSys 2009 (New York) \n  RecSys 2008 (Lausanne) \n  RecSys 2007 (Minnesota) \n  Workshops \n  Submission Statistics \n\n © 2012- 2024  \n  RecSys Community.

MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications.  \n   \n  MobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand, the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.  \n   \n  MobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments, especially in settings that is not easy for most in the community to duplicate (e.g., due to scale). MobiCom 2025 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 as described below in more detail.  \n   \n  Important Dates  \n  \n Summer | Winter \n Abstract Registration | August 29, 2024 23:59 AoE | March 11, 2025 23:59 AoE \n Paper Submission | September 5, 2024 23:59 AoE | March 18, 2025 23:59 AoE \n Early Notification | October 25, 2024 | May 10, 2025 \n Final Notifications | December 10, 2024 | June 24, 2025 \n\n  Topics  \n  \n  We invite submissions on a wide range of mobile computing, mobile systems, mobile applications, and wireless networking research, including but not limited to the following: Edge and cloud computing \n  Embedded and energy-harvesting systems \n  Backscatter communication and wireless power \n  Implantable and wearable computing \n  Millimeter-wave and terahertz communications \n  Mobile health \n  Applications of machine learning (on-device ML, federated/decentralized ML) to mobile/wireless research \n  Transfer learning and domain adaptation for mobile applications \n  Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI for mobile and wireless systems \n  Next generation of mobile networks (5G, 6G and beyond) \n  Mobile web, video, virtual reality, augmented reality and other applications \n  Novel applications of wireless signals \n  Practical quantum applications and systems (quantum sensing, quantum programming, quantum machine learning, etc.) \n  Vehicular, robotic and drone-based networking \n  Communication with reconfigurable and intelligent reflective surfaces, meta materials, and flexible surfaces \n  Satellite networks and integrated satellite-terrestrial networks \n  Security and privacy issues/solutions for mobile/wireless systems \n  Sensing with radio, light, sound, and acoustics \n  Smart cities and smart spaces (e.g. smart factories, smart workspace, smart agriculture, urban mobility) \n  Ubiquitous computing and mobile human-computer interaction \n  Underwater networking and sensing \n  Visible light communications \n  Wireless localization and tracking \n  Reducing carbon footprint of wireless networks and mobile devices \n   \n  Two Deadlines, Early Notification, and One-shot Revision  \n  \n  MobiCom 2025 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community.

The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted. \n  Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom. \n  One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. \n   \n  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers  \n The authors of accepted MobiCom 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here.  \n   \n  Submission Instructions  \n  \n  All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom 2025 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. Experience submissions should prefix ‘Experience Paper:’ to their title. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers.  \n   \n  Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed.  . You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked.  \n   \n  Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:  \n   \n  Contain no more than | twelve (12) | single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. \n  Submissions may include appendices (following bibliography references) and they will not count towards the 12 pages. However, reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is self-contained. \n  Font size no smaller than | 10 points | . \n  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. \n  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). \n  Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. \n  Authors' names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDFfile must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. \n  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. \n  You may find these templates  useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use \\documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}  . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify (manually or through the above online paper checker) that your submission is format-compliant.  \n\n  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n   \n  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n\n  Submission Policy  \n  \n  In addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are ​expected to make sure that their paper complies with the following submission policies.  \n   \n  Previous Publications  \n We allow submissions that extend a previous work published as a poster, demo, or workshop paper such as HotMobile or HotNets. However, in such case, the author(s) should (1) acknowledge their own previous workshop publication with an anonymous citation (e.g., \"[7] Anonymized workshop paper\") and (b) explain the differences between the MobiCom submission and the prior workshop paper (e.g. \"This paper extends a prior workshop paper [7] and differs in the following aspects ...\"). In addition, the online submission form will require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper. The PC will review such extended versions of previously-published workshop papers in accordance with the ACM Plagiarism Policy.  \n   \n  No Simultaneous Submissions  \n All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy ( ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous Submissions  ) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected  from all conferences/journals involved.  \n   \n  The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publications or submissions.  \n   \n   Double-blind Submissions  \n All submissions will be evaluated through double-blind reviewing. Please do not violate this requirement by explicitly or implicitly leaking the identity of any co-author or institution. They include but not limited to the below requirements: Please be sure your name and affiliation do not appear on the paper or in the submitted PDF file. This means that before submission, you must remove from the paper the authors' names, authors' affiliations, acknowledgments of funding sources, etc. \n  Please be cautious and careful how you refer to your own prior work in the paper. For example, do not describe your prior work with phrases like: | “In prior work[3], we presented a routing protocol that …” | Instead, refer to your work in the third person, such as | “In prior work, Smith[3] presented a routing protocol that …” | With this method, the full citation to Smith can still be given, such as | [3] Smith, J., \"Analysis of … \" | In particular, it is not acceptable to say | [3] Reference deleted for double-blind review. \n  Experience submissions should also be anonymous and not include the name of the authors and their affiliations. However, they may reveal the name of the deploying organization. \n  Please avoid advertising the paper with the same or similar title on your webpage, social media, or through large mailing lists. Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. The link in the paper, however, must be anonymized. Reviewers are not obliged to review such supplementary materials and such links must not be used to provide additional text that does not fit within the 12-page limit of the paper. \n  Authors are allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to MobiCom during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper on a preprint server before the MobiCom decisions are made, the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version. MobiCom strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media, personal web pages or in the press while under submission to MobiCom. Finally, any reviewer aware of the authorship of a specific submission, may not be allowed to review the paper, at the discretion of the PC chairs. \n  We will not review any paper that violates our double-blind policy.  \n   \n  Submissions will be kept confidential until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.  \n   \n   Conflict of Interest (CoI)  \n For a fair review process, program committee members who are COIs to any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion and decision-making of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark COIs in the submission website.  \n   \n  We generally follow the ACM policy ( Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  ) and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define COIs of one submission at MobiCom ’25 as:  \n  (1) any PC member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months  or reasonably expected within the next 12 months  ;  \n  (2) any PC member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  \n  (3) any PC member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  \n  (4) any PC member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author;  \n  (5) any PC member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;  \n  (6) any PC member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);  \n  (7) any PC member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;  \n  (8) others perceivable conflicts.  \n   \n  A potential COI must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  \n   \n  The author(s) must identify every COI out of all PC members (including chairs) with any  author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  \n   \n  Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated COI, and knowingly and falsely asserting a COI — e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another — are both considered as a violation of this COI policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews.  \n   \n   Previous Submissions  \n In case of any similarity between a current submission and a submission that has been previously rejected at MobiCom or other relevant conferences within the last 12 months, the authors are requested to do the following in three cases: For a one-shot revision, please carefully follow the instructions on the notification. Along with the resubmission, the authors must report the major concerns and requested items from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the revision. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. \n  For submissions that have been recently rejected by MobiCom, it is | required | for the authors to do the same as in case 1. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. \n  For submissions that have been previously rejected by a conference other than MobiCom (such as Mobisys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, SenSys, UbiComp, etc.), it is | strongly encouraged | , although not required, for the authors to do the same items as in case 2. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure your anonymity is retained in this summary. \n   \n   Processes for Conditionally Accepted Papers  \n  \n  Anonymous and Rigorous Shepherding   \n  Conditionally accepted papers will be shepherded through a review process by a TPC member. Based on the feedback written in the reviews, authors of shepherded papers will submit a revision of their paper to the shepherd. The shepherd will collaborate with the reviewers from TPC to review the revised paper and provide the authors with additional comments. Note that the shepherding process could last 4-6 weeks and the authors might be asked to produce new experimental results and/or add new material. When the shepherding process results in final acceptance, the authors will upload their camera-ready file to the submissions system.  \n   \n  Video Presentation   \n  The authors of each accepted paper will be asked to submit a one-minute video to introduce the research presented in their paper to the general public. These videos will be placed on the conference website and conference YouTube channel up to two weeks before the conference. A selected set will be featured by the social media channels related to the conference.  \n   \n  Registration and Presentation   \n  By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present it.  \n\n  Awards  \n  \n  All accepted regular  papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award  .  \n\n  Contact Us  \n  \n  For questions, please contact the Program Co-Chairs, Ganesh Ananthanarayanan  and Kate Lin  , at mobicom25-pc-chairs@acm.org  ."

MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications. MobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand, the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work. MobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments. MobiCom 2025 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 as described below in more detail. Topics We invite submissions on a wide range of mobile computing, mobile systems, mobile applications, and wireless networking research, including but not limited to the following: Edge and cloud computing Embedded and energy-harvesting systems Backscatter communication and wireless power Implantable and wearable computing Millimeter-wave and terahertz communications Mobile health Applications of machine learning (on-device ML, federated/decentralized ML) to mobile/wireless research Transfer learning and domain adaptation for mobile applications Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI for mobile and wireless systems Next generation of mobile networks (5G, 6G and beyond) Mobile web, video, virtual reality, augmented reality and other applications Novel applications of wireless signals Practical quantum applications and systems (quantum sensing, quantum programming, quantum machine learning, etc.) Vehicular, robotic and drone-based networking Communication with reconfigurable and intelligent reflective surfaces, meta materials, and flexible surfaces Satellite networks and integrated satellite-terrestrial networks Security and privacy issues/solutions for

RecSys brings together the major international research groups working on recommender systems, along with many of the world’s leading companies active in e-commerce and other adjacent domains. It has become the most important annual conference for the presentation and discussion of recommender systems research. RecSys 2024, the eighteenth conference in this series, will be held in Bari, Italy. It will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their latest results and identify new trends and challenges in providing recommendation components in a range of innovative application contexts. In addition to the main technical track, the RecSys 2024 program will feature keynote and invited talks, tutorials covering state-of-the-art in this domain, a workshop program, an industrial track and a doctoral symposium.  \n\n Statement on Inclusion and Safety  \n As the organizers of RecSys 2024, we are committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and respectful conference environment for all attendees. As we increasingly realize the impact of our community’s work on society, we appreciate now more than ever the importance of providing an inclusive and accessible conference that brings together a diverse recommender systems community.  \n  As an ACM conference, RecSys and its organizers, speakers, and attendees are bound by the ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment  , which applies to both the conference venue and social media. As organizers, this is a policy that we fully endorse.  \n  RecSys has made efforts over the last several years to be an accessible and inclusive community, across various perspectives, and we have sought throughout our planning of RecSys 2024 to continue and expand those efforts. The General Chairs ( Pasquale Lops and Tommaso Di Noia  ) welcome your input.  \n Accessibility and Inclusion at RecSys.  The RecSys conference values and cares about diversity, accessibility and inclusion. We have always been diverse in terms of disciplinary backgrounds (e.g. including both HCI- and data-focused work), professional affiliations (e.g. strong representation from both academia and industry), and application domains of our work. We are aware that members in our community may come from historically underrepresented groups, for which we wish to pro-actively encourage and support increased participation. To ensure the conference and its activities are accessible to all, we also explicitly seek to address the visible or invisible support needs members of our community may have.  \n Publications and Presentations.  RecSys hosts a variety of scientific discussions. Historically, we have prepared guidelines for accessible and inclusive presentations. We would like to emphasize that inclusive, safe and respectful addressing does not only apply to conference presentations, but also to the whole process leading towards these presentations, including the way in which research is presented and reviewed. We therefore would like to encourage our community members to already keep our best practice guidelines on inclusive language in mind, when preparing their manuscripts and peer reviewing.  \n Contact.  Should you experience or witness a violation of the anti-harassment policy, or have any other concerns regarding your ability to fully and safely participate in the conference, please email the RecSys General Chairs; you can also directly reach them at the conference venue.  \n We hope you have an amazing RecSys.  \n Pasquale Lops and Tommaso Di Noia   \n\n RecSys 2024 (Bari)  \n About the Conference \n  Program \n  Registration \n  Call for Contributions \n  Important Dates \n  Keynotes \n  Accepted Contributions \n  Challenge \n  Workshops \n  Tutorials \n  Committees \n  Location \n  Inclusion \n  Grants \n  Student Volunteers \n  Summer School \n  Women in RecSys \n\n Sapphire Supporter  \n\n Diamond Supporter  \n\n Platinum Supporter  \n\n Gold Supporter  \n\n Silver Supporter  \n\n Bronze Supporter  \n\n Women in RecSys’s Event Supporter  \n\n Challenge Sponsor  \n\n Special Supporters  \n\n Become a sponsor!    \n\n About this site  \n This site contains information about the ACM Recommender Systems community, the annual ACM RecSys conferences, and more.  \n\n RecSys 2024  \n About the Conference \n\n Shortcuts to Conferences RecSys 2024 (Bari) \n  RecSys 2023 (Singapore) \n  RecSys 2022 (Seattle) \n  RecSys 2021 (Amsterdam) \n  RecSys 2020 (Online) \n  RecSys 2019 (Copenhagen) \n  RecSys 2018 (Vancouver) \n  RecSys 2017 (Como) \n  RecSys 2016 (Boston) \n  RecSys 2015 (Vienna) \n  RecSys 2014 (Silicon Valley) \n  RecSys 2013 (Hong Kong) \n  RecSys 2012 (Dublin) \n  RecSys 2011 (Chicago) \n  RecSys 2010 (Barcelona) \n  RecSys 2009 (New York) \n  RecSys 2008 (Lausanne) \n  RecSys 2007 (Minnesota) \n  Workshops \n  Submission Statistics \n\n About the photos on this site The image  of Bari used in several headers is courtesy of Domenico Lacava licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0  and adapted to fit.  \n\n © 2012- 2024  \n  RecSys Community.

In early 1997, we had 21 members and were a relatively unknown organization. Since then, we have grown both in size and stature, with members who span the entire world. Our members work in academia, industry, and government. They are students, teachers, practioners, policy makers, and scientists. Our organization boasts one of the most remarkable retention rates among all ACM SIGs.  \n  \n The single identifying characteristic of our members is that we are a very passionate bunch. We believe we are changing the world, and we are. Our interests range from building commercially viable handheld devices with powerful communications and computing ability, to lightweight wearables that are part of a soldier's battle gear, connecting him to the rest of his platoon or division. We are interested in providing computing and Internet access in automobiles, trains, ships, planes, and spacecraft. We build satellites that connect to each other and to the Internet. We work on problems related to connectivity and functionality of millions of sensors, which we believe will become pervasive. We are interested in personal and body-area networks. Most of all, we are interested in enabling the reliable flows of useful bits in the air, the computing power in your hand, and anywhere and anytime ubiquitous communications.  \n Deadline  : TBD | Date  : TBD  \n Place/Country  : TBD/TBD  \n The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2026 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2025 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2024 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2023 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2022 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2021 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2020 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2019 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2018 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2017 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2016 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2015 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2014 \n  The 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking MobiCom2013 - MobiCom \n  18th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking(MobiCom2012) - MobiCom \n  The 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking MobiCom 2011 - MobiCom 2011 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2010 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2009 \n  MobiCom 2008, the 14th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2008 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2007 \n  The 12th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2006 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2005 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2004 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2003 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2002 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2001 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 2000 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 1999 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 1998 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 1997 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 1996 \n  The Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking - MobiCom 1995 \n   Keywords  : Accepted papers list.

While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.  \n   The conference was held in this new merged format for the very first time from September 8-12, 2013  , in Zurich, Switzerland.  \n The UbiComp 2013 Proceedings  are available via the ACM Digital Library (ISBN 978-1-4503-1770-2).  \n By offering a single venue for the leading worldwide research in Pervasive and Ubiquitous computing, the new format is meant to better serve the needs of the research community by attracting more attendees (including the leading Pervasive/UbiComp researchers worldwide), and enabling more satellite events. UbiComp 2013 was multi-track and featured a program  of 92 scientific paper presentations (acceptance rate 23.4%)  . Topics included any work that one would previously expect to find at either UbiComp or Pervasive.  \n Following several successful collaborations as part of the Pervasive conference series, UbiComp 2013 continued the tradition of collocating with ISWC 2013  .  \n The adjunct program  is available at www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2013/adjunct/starthere.htm  .

Applied improvisation techniques can be used in teaching of technical concepts such as cybersecurity, agile development, database design, programming concepts, and most importantly, how to better one’s communication and teamwork skills. This workshop is designed for those who want to learn more about some of the various techniques used and how they can be incorporated into the IT curriculum. Nearly 20 years ago, the National Academy of Sciences Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) recognized the importance of improvisation as tool to help IT practitioners become more creative. Creative problem-solving methodologies such as design thinking all tie into the use of improvisation. Companies such as Twitter, IDEO, and Google are using improvisation methods as a way of creating better collaborative teams and a work environment that says YES before NO. Improvisation training can help students and faculty to become better listeners, communicators, collaborators, innovators and those who can better focus on the organization or team story and not their own story.  \n\n SESSION: Session 2: Keynote Talk 1  \n Technology Leadership in Today’s World   \n Daren Thayne \n  The world needs innovative technology leaders. Virtually every organization relies on technology. And those organizations need innovative technology leaders who not only know how to wear the many and necessary hats, but who also are strategic partners who are fully aligned with the goals of the organization. How has the role of technology leadership changed over time? What are the attributes that define innovative technology leaders? To stay competitive in this world, why is it becoming more and more critical that organizations hire and develop innovative technology leaders?  \n\n SESSION: Session 3A: Curriculum  \n CC2020: An IT-Centric Overview   \n Barry M. Lunt \n  In 2005, the ACM, together with the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Information Systems, released Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report[1]. This document has proven to be one of the most widely circulated and influential documents ever produced on the topic of computing curricula, and included computing programs in computer engineering (CE), computer science (CS), information systems (IS), information technology (IT), and software engineering (SE). This document was recently updated and released as Computing Curricula 2020: Paradigms for Global Computing Education[2], and included the first 5 computing programs as well as cybersecurity (CSEC) and some of data science (DS). This paper takes an IT-centric look at this updated document highlighting the changes and the additional insights this significant reference provides the computing educational community.  \n\n Revisiting Syntax Exercises in CS1   \n Anna Ly \n  John Edwards \n  Michael Liut \n  Andrew Petersen \n  Previous work has suggested that adopting a “syntax-first pedagogy” in introductory programming (CS1) improved student retention and performance. To confirm these results we added syntax exercises to an existing CS1 course. A quasi-experimental design was used, with topics with and without a syntax exercise introduction being compared. Data collected includes performance (number of submissions and time spent) on weekly exercises and assignments as well as student evaluations collected weekly and at the end of the term. Our observations suggest that a syntax-first approach improves student performance in the short-term. Students generally performed better on weekly exercises introduced using the syntax exercises, in terms of both the number of submissions required and time spent, than they did on exercises that were not. Furthermore, the reductions in time required to solve the existing weekly exercises partially offset the time required by the new syntax-focused exercises, and students, particularly those with less prior experience, valued the new syntax exercises. Our results suggest that adopting a syntax-first approach may have benefits for students with lower prior experience, and we encourage additional work, both to evaluate a fully-converted syntax-first course and to assess syntax exercises in a more controlled setting.  \n\n Strategies for Integrating Two-Year Information Technology and Cybersecurity Programs   \n Markus Geissler \n  Cara Tang \n  To meet the high demand for trained Cybersecurity professionals, many two-year colleges which have been offering degree programs in Information Technology (IT) are expanding or revising their course offerings to include Cybersecurity courses. The increasing importance of Cybersecurity skills has led to an increase in Cybersecurity requirements for IT majors. Due to considerations related to competency overlap, vendor-based academy content, government designations, faculty qualifications, general education requirements enrollment capacity, and other factors, two-year colleges are evaluating various options for how to effectively offer both IT and Cybersecurity content. Options include separate IT and Cybersecurity degrees, IT and Cybersecurity concentrations using a common core of general Computing courses, and multiple IT degree concentrations based on a common IT core. Colleges should evaluate the competencies expected of completers to determine how to best structure their programs.  \n\n SESSION: Session 3B: Panel 1  \n Equipping and Empowering Faculty through Professional Development to Create a Future-Ready Workforce in Emerging Technologies   \n Farzana Rahman \n  Elodie Billionniere \n  Ann Quiroz Gates \n  Felesia Stukes \n  Tech industry, especially, some areas within tech fields, such as Emerging Technology (EmTech), like cybersecurity, data science, mobile development, machine learning AI, and cloud computing, are expected to experience immense increases in job opportunities in coming years. While a variety of solutions are necessary to address the growing workforce needs in the EmTech industry, one of the largest untapped talent pools is women and underrepresented students. Clearly, HBCU and MSI hold great potential to broaden participation in EmTech because of their more diverse student populations access to a large number of underrepresented students, and closer faculty-to-student interaction. However, faculties at these institutions, who are at the forefront of developing required skills in students are often overlooked. Faculties at these institutions need help designing and implementing effective and evidence-based instruction materials to develop skills that are in high-demand in the EmTech industry. The goal of this panel is to offer a platform that can provide insight into the development of faculty professional development programs in EmTech in traditional institutions and within the context of HBCU and MSI.  \n\n SESSION: Session 4A: Cybersecurity  \n UCLP: A Novel UAV Cybersecurity Laboratory Platform   \n Ashok Raja \n  Julio Galvan \n  Yanyan Li \n  Jiawei Yuan \n  Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their applications in various fields. At the same time, the utilization of UAVs also raises serious security and safety concerns. Given a large number of UAV-related jobs to be created in the near future, it is pressing to educate and train current and next-generation cybersecurity professionals towards UAVs and their applications. However, there is a lack of education and training materials on UAV cybersecurity especially for hands-on practice. In this paper, we propose a novel UAV cybersecurity laboratory platform (UCLP), which provides efficient and effective hands-on practice. UCLP offers not only a cost-effective UAV cybersecurity practice environment, but also a series of designed and pre-configured lab modules. UCLP adopts a plug-in based design and hence supporting flexible customization of existing and new lab modules. UCLP uses technical solutions to overcome non-technical limitations in UAV cybersecurity practice (e.g., regulations of UAV operations). Our evaluation results demonstrated the efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness of UCLP and indicated UCLP is promising to be integrated into the education and training of UAV, cybersecurity, and related fields.  \n\n An Online Gamified Learning Platform for Teaching Cybersecurity and More   \n Mac Malone \n  Yicheng Wang \n  Fabian Monrose \n  We present an online gamified learning platform for computer science and cybersecurity education. Exercises within the platform revolve around a custom game wherein students can demonstrate learned skills regarding password security, web security, traffic analysis, reverse engineering, cryptanalysis, and much more. We describe some key features that together make our platform novel, including its distributed infrastructure game engine, integrated development environment, automated feedback system, and support for individualization. We demonstrate how these features assist in the learning process — both in theory and in practice — and report on the use of the platform in a cybersecurity course.  \n\n Scaring People is Not Enough: An Examination of Fear Appeals within the Context of Promoting Good Password Hygiene   \n Marc Dupuis \n  Anna Jennings \n  Karen Renaud \n  Fear appeals have been used for thousands of years to scare people into engaging in a specific behavior or omitting an existing one. From religion, public health campaigns political ads, and most recently, cybersecurity, fear appeals are believed to be effective tools. However, this assumption is often grounded in intuition rather than evidence. We know little about the specific contexts within which fear appeals may or may not work. In this study, we begin to examine various components of a fear appeal within the context of password hygiene. A large-scale randomized controlled experiment was conducted with one control and three treatment groups: (1) fear only; (2) measures needed and the efficacy of such measures, and (3) fear combined with measures needed and the efficacy of such measures. The results suggest that the most effective way to employ a fear appeal within the cybersecurity domain is by ensuring that fear is not used on its own. Instead, it is important that information on the measures needed to address the threat and the efficacy of such measures is used in combination with information about the nature of the threat. Since many individuals that enter the information technology profession become the de facto security person, it is important for information technology education programs to distill in students the inadequacy of fear, on its own, in motivating secure actions.  \n\n SESSION: Session 4B: Big Ideas in IT Education  \n Domains and Contexts: Tracks in Introductory Project Management Courses   \n Diane Shichtman \n  Andrew Weiss \n  The fundamentals of project management are the same regardless of the industry or organization. However, in some settings, individual elements of project management might be more or less significant, and teaching students about contexts and domains that are familiar or of interest can help engage them.  \n\n DevOps: The Sky’s the Limit in Higher Education   \n Christina Hupy \n\n How To Avoid Peter and His Principle   \n Hollis Greenberg \n  Does the current recommended computing curricula prepare our students to work in the business world? Technology does not exist in a silo. Technical employees work in departments where they manage projects, people, and budgets. Many computing disciplines solely focus on the technological skills, completely ignoring the other skills necessary to be successful and to achieve upward mobility in the business world.  \n\n Is Hybrid Teaching Good for Your IT Class?   \n Chunming Gao \n  Bryan Goda \n  This presentation aims to discuss using hybrid approach to engage students’ active learning in IT course teachings. We introduce our practices and findings in teaching a core IT course in a hybrid class. We present the promising outcomes and aim to invoke discussions on the benefits and potential challenges in making IT classes hybrid.  \n\n SESSION: Session 5: Poster Session  \n Inspiring Student Creativity: Collaboration on a Network Design Using IoT Project   \n Sharon Gumina \n  Hengtao Tang \n  A key initiative of the College of Engineering and Computing at USC is fostering creativity in its students and educators [11]. Emergent technologies make it difficult to predict what skills students will need as computer systems become more complex and dynamic. Including classroom activities that encourage creativity and collaboration prepares students for Information Technology (IT) and real-life application of their networking skills. The Final Project for the Introduction to Networking course that is described in this paper was designed to be a creative teaching experience in the classroom. It also contributed to the Introduction to Networking course learning outcomes by preparing students for risk-taking and uncertainty in real-world network applications  \n\n An Open Educational Resource for an Agile Software Engineering Course   \n Cengiz Günay \n  Anca Doloc-Mihu \n  The field of software technologies has been seeing a steady growth worldwide recently. Engineering job roles might require candidates to know several different programming paradigms, languages, frameworks, and cloud technologies. Each of these technologies constantly evolve to improve or become obsolete, which requires educational materials for teaching them to be constantly updated. Software engineering has classical texts that have been updated over many editions. These are large volumes with numerous chapters that include older and newer techniques, history, and a variety of extra material which makes them expensive textbooks. This also make them contain too much material to cover in undergraduate courses. As published textbooks are always updated slower than the pace of technology that changes project dependencies every three months or so, practical materials may still become outdated between editions. Open educational resources (OERs) provide solutions to these problems by allowing adopters to update and customize materials for a given syllabus. An OER can simply mean a no-cost textbook or a resource that is publicly available for teaching. In this work, we present a preliminary OER for software development or engineering courses for undergraduate information technology (IT) majors.  \n\n A Framework for the Discipline of Information Technology   \n Hazem Said \n  Michael Zidar \n  Said Varlioglu \n  Cornelius Itodo \n  This paper presents a framework for the academic discipline of information technology. The framework defines four independent elements to the discipline: People, Information Technology, and the Solutions or Needs that connect them. In IT practice, the information technology discipline aim is the selection, creation, integration, application, security and administration of solutions that use technology to empower people through information. In IT research, the discipline aim is the investigation, discovery, and dissemination of needs that connect people, information, and technology. The proposed framework presents a theory for the discipline of information technology to inform its research and practice. It builds on past efforts to define the information technology discipline and provides a foundation for academic institutions and the industry to proactively address the need for talent and innovation to sustain the economic engine of our society.  \n\n Block-based Programming Enabling Students to Gain and Transfer Knowledge with a No-code Approach   \n Luis Corral \n  Ilenia Fronza \n  Claus Pahl \n  In this article, we describe our experience designing and teaching a curriculum on mobile software development that has benefitted from the no-code philosophy leveraging the power of block-based programming tools. We review a journey of 10 years using block-based programming platforms to lay foundations on software development skills and empower the creative potential of high school students. Our objective is to provide a review of the evolution, capabilities and technical coverage of the block-based software platforms, and to discuss the impact that we have observed on users and developers who have become acquainted on the use of block-based programming tools through our courses  \n\n A Computer-Vision Based Engagement Evaluation System for More Effective Learning Design   \n Zhigang Li \n  Jiaming Li \n  Meng Han \n  Ming Yang \n  Student engagement during online instruction has been a challenge. Particularly in an asynchronous learning environment, assessing and measuring student engagement is a difficult task. This paper proposes a solution to fill in the gap between the need to evaluate student engagement during online instruction and the lack of an effective method to do so. The proposed web-based learning environment fully incorporates the latest development in facial expression recognition to capture the facial expression changes during the course of instruction. The facial expression data can then be visualized for further analysis to help instructors pinpoint the exact locations where the instruction needs improvements. In addition, the proposed system can also be used in corporate training settings, particularly in scenarios where the learners’ emotional responses are desired.  \n\n Creating an Immersive and Active Educational Experience for Generation Z: Adapting the Introductory Information Technology Course for Digital Natives   \n Travis Dalton \n  John Gerdes \n  An introductory information technology (IT) course (ITEC 101) was designed to engage IT students and attract non-degree students. Student feedback suggests an update was needed. A survey gauged student sentiment and solicited positive and negative feedback and recommendations for change. Results suggests students prefer active learning and want more emphasis on meaningful content and assignments. We discuss the course redesign. Active learning is emphasized, incorporating a flipped classroom model to engage and build student enthusiasm for information technology.  \n\n dbLearn*: Open-Source System and a Set of Practices for Conducting Iterative Exercises and Exams in a Databases Course   \n Vangel Ajanovski \n  The author’s approach in teaching databases, focuses on acquiring competences needed to use and develop systems of realistic complexity, typical for a micro or small company. Each student works towards gaining experience with various database designs and implementations querying and development of relational schemas, and building applications. An open-source system is introduced, intended to help teachers organize such courses at a scale and effectively guide the students in an iterative process of acquiring competencies at the level of smaller groups or even individuals. The main goal of the system is speed-up of administrative tasks at all levels. The system implements the core process of organizing exams in a partial and piece-wise manner, and implements sets of tools and practices for semi-automated assessment processes.  \n\n Preparing Students for Automated IT Workflows   \n Heidi J. C. Ellis \n  Gregory W. Hislop \n  This poster discusses some efforts to develop student skills with current IT workflow tools and processes. These experiences have been introduced within the context of existing courses rather than trying to add an additional course to already crowded curricula.  \n\n Building an Impersonation Attack and Defense Testbed for Vehicle To Vehicle Systems   \n Mostafa El-Said \n  Xinli Wang \n  Samah Mansour \n  Andrew Kalafut \n  Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication takes place among a wide range of wireless nodes such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles. However, V2V systems are vulnerable to Global Positioning Systems (GPS) spoofing attacks, where a malicious vehicle may spoof a victim vehicle’s GPS coordinates to impersonate it. Thus, the malicious vehicle can act as a traffic injector imperiling traffic safety. In this work, we use simulation software as a platform to develop a practical testbed to execute an impersonation attack along with an in-vehicle defense technique.  \n\n The Super-Node Topology in Collaborative Learning   \n Loubna Mekouar \n  Muna Bader \n  Fatna Belqasmi \n  Incorporating new collaborative learning strategies will help increase students’ engagement and improve the learning experience. In this paper, we present a new method of group formation inspired by the super-node topology in peer-to-peer systems. This method proved to enhance students’ engagement, productivity, and cognitive skills in group-based assessments.  \n\n Designing Technology for Single Fathers using Human-Centered Design Approach   \n Andrew S. Burgdorf \n  Annu Sible Prabhakar \n  In this paper, we present a preliminary inquiry into the designing of support interventions for single fathers. We hope that a potential intervention would help them cope with the daily stressors of parenting. Currently, support solutions specifically designed for single fathers are scarce. This research uses the Human-centered design methodology to engaged single fathers in multiple research activities to gain insight into their support needs to inform potential designs for support interventions.  \n\n Introducing Programming Concepts through Interactive Online Workshops   \n Valentina Mosquera Reina \n  Ryan Cunico \n  Josiah Williams \n  Matthew Bauer \n  Anca Doloc-Mihu \n  Cindy Robertson \n  Students from the Technology Ambassadors Program (TAP) at Georgia Gwinnett College introduce basic programming concepts to online workshop participants by demonstrating and creating an interactive racing game using the Scratch programming language. The workshop encourages interest in the STEM fields, while teaching basic programming skills to control the game’s logic. Our study results showed that our workshops were successful and engaging.  \n\n Leveraging Bias Conscious Artificial Intelligence to Increase STEM Graduates Among Underrepresented Populations   \n Josette Riep \n  Annu Prabhakar \n  Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) remains one of the fastest-growing and one of the most segregated professions in the United States. Predominately white and male, opportunities in STEM continue to grow exponentially. Areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for example are expected to become $11 trillion industries by 2025. As employers struggle to find skilled candidates we face the reality that African Americans are too often left behind. African Americans make up less than 5% of the IT workforce and a small percentage of IT graduates. Although there is acknowledgment and some investment by both industry and educational institutions there has been minimal success in changing the demographic landscape. This study focuses on how AI can be used to better understand barriers, personalize student experiences and provide pathways of attainment for an increasingly diverse student body.  \n\n SESSION: Session 6: Workshop 2  \n Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Workshop   \n Kristina Kaldon \n  Robert Love \n  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is changing the way we work, by automating mundane and repetitive tasks. RPA leverages software robots to interact with web and desktop applications just like humans do, through the user interface. In this workshop, UiPath will provide an overview of RPA and industry use cases, as well as hands-on exercises and knowledge on how to teach RPA to students.  \n\n SESSION: Session 7: Keynote Talk 2  \n Getting Everyone the IT Education They Need   \n Mark Guzdial \n  The inventors of the term “computer science” meant for it to be something that was taught to everyone, to facilitate learning other subjects, and to help people understand the risks of technology in their lives. Alan Perlis (with Newell and Simon) published the first definition of “computer science” in Science in 1967 [6]. In 1961, he argued at MIT that everyone at the academia should learn to program, to give them a new way to understand their world [10]. At the same event, C.P. Snow (author of The Two Cultures [11]) argued that we should teach everyone about computing so that they would understand the dangers in our new computerized society [12]. He wrote: “A handful of people having no relation to the will of society, having no communication with the rest of society, will be taking decisions in secret which are going to affect our lives in the deepest sense.”  \n The world today relies on information technology but, we mostly teach IT to people who will become professionals. This leaves us with only a privileged class that understands a critical part of our world. If we want to reach the original and more general goal we will have to change how we teach about computing. With my students and collaborators I have been identifying the barriers to giving everyone an understanding of the computing technology in their world.We have explored how socioeconomic status influences success in computing [9], and how increasing access to high school computing courses has not led to a commensurate increase in the number or diversity fo students taking those courses [7, 8]. We have been studying why students reject computer science [1], and how to invent new forms of computing education that meet the needs of students who have not succeeded in traditional computing courses [2]. In our most recent work we ask questions like “What are fundamental ideas of computing that everyone needs to reason about and use the computational technologies in their world?” and “How can we re-design computation to make it more approachable, accessible, and adoptable?” [3-5]  \n\n SESSION: Session 8A: Jobs & Careers  \n Are you one of us?: How Employers Prioritize among IT Graduates   \n Per Lauvås \n  Kjetil Raaen \n  Anders Olof Larsson \n  When we are designing IT education and degree programs, knowledge about what graduates need to succeed is important. One source of such knowledge are employers. This paper presents a survey of Norwegian employers asking what they are looking for in a recently graduated IT candidate. We confirm that the so called soft skills are highly prized. Among these, we identify a less reported concept of fitting into company or team culture as the most important. Another somewhat unexpected result is that employers do not expect to see a portfolio from graduates. Among technologies mentioned, Java is at the top followed closely by C# and .NET. Python and JavaScript are also mentioned often. Our study suggests that soft skills should be a focus throughout IT education programs.  \n\n Retrieving and Classifying LinkedIn Job Titles for Alumni Career Analysis   \n Lei Li \n  Svetlana Peltsverger \n  Jack Zheng \n  Linh Le \n  Michael Handlin \n  It is important for universities to track alumni careers after graduation for both program quality improvement and accreditation requirements. The most common way of collecting such data is through alumni surveys, but historically these surveys had low response rates. LinkedIn, a social network site that targets working professionals provides a great platform for academic programs to connect with alumni and collect their career information. Current approaches for career analysis using LinkedIn data often require a labor-intensive manual process that is not scalable and sustainable. In this paper, we propose a system for the automated retrieval and classification of LinkedIn job titles for alumni career analysis. Our research prototype and experiment results show that the proposed system can effectively crawl LinkedIn profiles and classify job titles based on Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) job categories [1]. Our approach is the first of its kind in career analysis using LinkedIn and can be easily adopted by other universities or programs to develop career analysis systems for their alumni.  \n\n Transforming Education: Upskilling for a Cloudy Tomorrow   \n Elodie Billionniere \n  Lawrence Meyer \n  Cloud computing deployment and demand has increased year over year during the prior decade and has only accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid increase in cloud technology has also increased the need for higher education institutions to train students and re-skill or up-skill working professionals. This paper discusses the application of high impact training methodologies and their impact on student learning.  \n\n SESSION: Session 8B: Panel 2  \n Meaningful Course Evaluations   \n Heidi J. C. Ellis \n  Gregory W. Hislop \n  Cara Tang \n  Stephen Zilora \n  Evaluating courses and how well they are taught is an essential task for every educational institution. Evaluations support improvement of instruction and course content. They are also often an important input to annual reviews and tenure and promotion decisions. In spite of these important uses, many institutions do not feel that their course evaluations are meeting these needs as well as they would like. And faculty, students and administrators all seem to have some level of complaint and frustration related to evaluations. This panel will focus on course evaluation for computing degree programs. Panelists will identify problems and discuss helpful ideas for making course evaluations more useful.  \n\n SESSION: Session 9A: Online/Hybrid & COVID  \n Modeling Computing Students’ Perceived Academic Performance in an Online Learning Environment   \n Rex Bringula \n  Ma. Ymelda Batalla \n  Ma. Teresa Borebor \n  This study attempted to develop a model that characterized the perceived academic performance of computing students (subsequently referred to as students) in an online learning environment. It was hypothesized that students’ academic performance in online learning could be modeled through their online learning capabilities, attitudes towards online learning, and online learning academic self-concept. Toward this goal, 264 students answered a validated survey form. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that perceived academic performance in terms of perceived grade attainment and perceived learning achievements had different sets of predictors. This finding indicates that perceived academic performance in an online learning environment has two distinct measures with distinct sets of predictors. Additional analyses revealed that the students are further distinguished when the predictors were categorized by levels of academic performance. Implications to online teaching and recommendations are discussed.  \n\n Misinformation and Disinformation in the Era of COVID-19: The Role of Primary Information Sources and the Development of Attitudes Toward Vaccination   \n Marc Dupuis \n  Kelly Chhor \n  Nhu Ly \n  Misinformation is not new; however, the proliferation of social media has resulted in a much broader reach and instantaneous impact. Results from such proliferation were seen during the 2016 and 2020 elections in the United States. The reach of false information in the context of a U.S. Presidential election would not be the pinnacle of the harm it can cause. In the current context, the spread of false information in the middle of a pandemic and related to causes, cures, and conspiracies, has the potential to do real harm, if it has not already. Now that vaccines are widely available in some countries, this harm may result in lives being lost that did not have to be. In this paper, we explore vaccination status in the context of information sources used by individuals. The results suggest that a lack of trust and engagement in traditional news outlets is associated with lower levels of COVID-19 vaccination initiation or completion. Higher levels of engagement with sources that have been used in the past to propagate conspiracy theories, such as YouTube, are also associated with lower levels of vaccination initiation or completion. Public health implications and the need for greater information literacy are discussed.  \n\n Dual Teaching: Simultaneous Remote and In-Person Learning During COVID   \n Hunter Williams \n  Malcolm Haynes \n  Joseph Kim \n  Social distancing guidelines put in place to combat COVID-19 resulted in a general education introductory information technology course being taught in a dual teaching environment. Each lesson, some students attended in-person while simultaneously others attended remotely. Students alternated each lesson between in-person and remote attendance. We examined whether there was any difference in performance between in-person and remote attendance using an end-of-lesson quiz. For some students the quiz was announced and for others it was unannounced. Additionally, we measured the subjective experience of students via a survey. We found that students attending class in-person performed better on end of class quizzes; the difference was small but statistically significant. In-person students also reported paying more attention, being more engaged, and understanding the lesson material better than remote students. Announcing the quiz did not statistically affect performance, although it did improve the subjective experience of in-person students. Finally, when it comes to dual teaching, both students and instructors prefer in-person or remote teaching. Nevertheless, dual teaching may be an effective approach; there was little difference in final course grades between in-person teaching and dual teaching.  \n\n SESSION: Session 9B: Programming  \n Enabling Peer-Led Coding Camps by Creating a Seed Effect in Young Students   \n Ilenia Fronza \n  Luis Corral \n  Gennaro Iaccarino \n  Claus Pahl \n  During peer-led intensive events (such as hackathons and coding camps), students actively assist others to learn and, in turn, benefit from an effective learning environment. In this paper, we present the results of an observational study, having as a working setting a coding camp based on Computational Thinking (CT), to explore how peer-led coding camps can create a seed effect in young students. In particular, we analyze how a practical approach to convey CT skills motivates and effectively prepares student tutors. Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.  \n\n Assessing the Effectiveness of Teaching Programming Concepts through Online Interactive Outreach Workshops   \n Cindy Robertson \n  Anca Doloc-Mihu \n  In this study, we present our findings with regard to the effectiveness of teaching computing concepts online via interactive outreach projects. These outreach activities were facilitated through our service-based learning course, the Technology Ambassador Program (TAP). The goal is to determine how effective these online outreach activities are and how we can improve upon them. The results of this study show that online outreach activities can be effective using already known teaching strategies such as repetition and hands-on activities. Surprisingly, we also found that these strategies work whether the participants are STEM or non-STEM students. Another important finding was the limitation of self-reported knowledge of understanding compared to the objectively assessed ability to implement the knowledge.  \n\n Undergraduate Research Experience with Software Development using a Large Existing Code Base in a Teaching-oriented College   \n Wei Jin \n  David Marshall \n  Puen Xie \n  Jiawei Li \n  Matthew Stiller \n  Taisann Kham \n  Dakota Norris \n  Ikechukwu Okolocha \n  Undergraduate research has been shown to enrich education, increase retention and promote critical thinking. Research projects involving extending an already mature and relatively large code base have special value for students, as they mimic industry experience. Students have to understand the existing code structure and figure out where to add their code to extend the functionality of the system. There are obvious challenges for undergraduate students to take on such projects, including lack of knowledge at the onset of the project, limited time span (normally a semester), and limited time availability during a semester. Undergraduate institutions have additional challenges, such as high teaching load for faculty advisors and lack of graduate students who could act as mentors. In this paper, we report our experience with a relatively large project that lasted for several semesters and involved several teams of students. We managed the challenges by being flexible and carving out many mini-projects from this umbrella project, which required that the faculty advisor work closely with students. The project has successfully produced a teaching/learning tool for auto-gradable full tracing exercises. The tool has been prototyped in classrooms and helped students learn various programming constructs. We hope that our experience could encourage larger scale projects in undergraduate institutions.  \n\n SESSION: Session 10A: Teaching Techniques & Ideas  \n Applying Aviation Training Techniques in the IT Classroom   \n Stephen J. Zilora \n  Aviation training is a rigorous process requiring the student pilot to learn the theoretical underpinnings of multiple subjects, risk management and decision making under stress and, of course, the skills necessary to fly a plane. The educational process is rooted in learning theory, but it utilizes several approaches more fully than in typical academic classrooms resulting in a significantly greater level of engagement. This paper documents the results of a pilot study to apply three of these approaches in an information technology programming course-the Master/Apprentice approach, a focus on task mastery vs. time on task, and shared responsibility for achieving goals. While these three approaches were implemented to a limited degree during the pilot, the successful results suggest a more complete implementation of these approaches which is also outlined in this paper.  \n\n Investigating the Role of Different Prep Pathways on CS2 Performance Across Three Different Majors   \n Farzana Rahman \n  Jaya Tyagi \n  Research have shown that introductory programming sequence have a significant impact in the retention of students in computing and engineering majors. There has been extensive research about the CS1 course [1]. Much less has been written about the CS1.5 and CS2 course, which are often gateway courses for computing and engineering majors. CS2 classes often reflect a second semester course in programming, yet when studying this course many universities have different purposes for this course. Currently there is a wide range of variation in CS courses. Some of these are used to expose students to a wider range of languages; in other cases, a new language is used to introduce concepts such as object-oriented programming, instead of the language used in CS1. However, even though CS2 is one of the fundamental courses in computing or CS major curriculum, the impacts of the different prep pathways leading to CS2 course is not well studied [2, 3]. Due to the critical nature of the CS2 course and its importance in CS major curriculum, in many institutions, CS2 or data structure course is recognized as an attrition point for CS Majors [4]. Understanding the impacts of the different prep pathways in CS2 course performance and the CS2 curriculum itself could give insights into the attrition behaviors. This paper presents a study which is conducted to understand the impact how student performance in CS2 course gets impacted by different programming languages used in CS1.5 course.  \n\n Tadawl: An Educational Platform for Gamifying Startup Investment   \n Hend S. Al-Khalifa \n  Rawan Al-Matham \n  Gamification, or the use of game mechanics in non-game applications, allows students to learn by doing. In this paper we present our experience in implementing a gamification platform in our entrepreneurship course to encourage students on investing in their peers’ projects and provide them with feedback. The platform involved the interaction of 106 undergraduate female students during a semester long entrepreneurship course. We also report the results obtained after using the platform in terms of students’ feedback and final remarks.  \n\n SESSION: Session 10B: Panel 3  \n We Did It! So Can You! Creating “No-Textbook” IT Degrees   \n Rebecca Rutherfoord \n  Lei Li \n  Hossain Shahriar \n  James Rutherfoord \n  One of the largest expenses for university students is the cost of textbooks. This is particularly true in the STEM areas. Data shows that course textbooks cost more and more every year. Textbook costs have risen 812% since 1978 and 73% since 2006 – which is four times the rate of inflation. The College Board recommends that students budget at least $1200 per year for textbook costs. Over 1/3 of students use their financial aid for textbook costs. The average computer science/IT textbook costs $180. In order to help alleviate some of these textbook costs, the State of Georgia has been offering to faculty Affordable Learning Grants across all majors. Several faculty in the Information Technology Department of Kennesaw State University were awarded an ALG grant during the Summer-Fall 2018 for redevelopment of four undergraduate IT courses using no textbook. In the past three years several IT faculty members have been awarded these ALG grants for redevelopment of information security courses, database courses, and an ethics course. The results of the redevelopment of the database courses and information security courses have been very positive for the students. The panel will discuss the current re-development of IT courses, and report on the positive results of prior re-development of no-textbook courses.  \n\n SESSION: Session 6: Workshop 3  \n Design Thinking For Technology Design   \n Annu Sible Prabhakar \n  This paper describes the workshop titled “Design Thinking For Technology Design.” Design thinking is a collaborative design process that keeps the user’s needs at the center. This workshop will introduce design thinking methodology to the participants through hands-on activities. The workshop participants will work on a problem and design a low fidelity prototype of a potential solution. This workshop is open to everyone.  \n\n Recent Posts   \n\n March 4, 2024   \n SIGITE 2024 – 25nd Annual Conference on IT Education – Call for Papers    \n\n March 28, 2023   \n SIGITE 2023 – 24nd Annual Conference on IT Education: Call For Papers    \n\n Categories   \n Communication \n  Conferences \n  Curriculum \n  News \n  Organization \n  Research \n  Uncategorized \n\n Archives   \n March 2024 \n  March 2023 \n  September 2022 \n  May 2022 \n  April 2021 \n  March 2021 \n  June 2020 \n  December 2019 \n  March 2019 \n  January 2019 \n  May 2018 \n  April 2018 \n  May 2017 \n  March 2017 \n  May 2016 \n  February 2016 \n  May 2015 \n  February 2015 \n  January 2015 \n  August 2014 \n  January 2014 \n  September 2013 \n  April 2013 \n  November 2012 \n  October 2012 \n  July 2012 \n  March 2012 \n  August 2011 \n  May 2011 \n  April 2011 \n  March 2011 \n  February 2011 \n\n About SIGITE   \n SIGITE is the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Information Technology Education.

Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged. For a list of specific topics of interest, please see the end of this call.  \n Note #1:  The Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE)  Issue FSE 2025 seeks contributions through submissions in this track. Accepted papers will be invited for presentation at FSE 2025. Approval has been granted by ACM in July 2023. PACMSE will be the only proceedings where accepted research track papers will be published. Please check the FAQ  for details.  \n Note #2:  The steering committee has decided that starting from 2024 the conference name will be changed to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE).  \n Note #3:  Based on the coordination among FSE, ICSE, and ASE steering committees, the FSE conference and submission dates have been moved earlier, similarly to FSE 2024 deadlines. The intention is for this schedule to remain stable in the years ahead and the conference and submission deadlines of the three large general software engineering conferences to be spread out throughout the year.  \n Note #4:  Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgement).  \n Note #5:  The names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  \n Note #6:  Submissions that are changing the required submission format to gain additional space will be desk rejected. Examples of changing format include removing the ACM Reference format and the permission to make digital or hard copy footnotes on the first page.  \n Tracks   \n This CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025   \n HOW TO SUBMIT   \n At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex  or Word (Mac)  or Word (Windows)  . Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex  file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall  option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In summary, you want to use: \\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}  . Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site:  \n https://fse2025.hotcrp.com   \n Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The review process is that the initial output can be accept, reject or major revision  . When the initial output of the three reviews is major revision, authors will have an opportunity to address the reviewers’ requests during a 6-week  major revision period. Such requests may include additional experiments or new analyses of existing results; major rewriting of algorithms and explanations; clarifications, better scoping, and improved motivations. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter  , where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. The same reviewers who requested major revisions will then assess whether the revised submission satisfies their requests adequately.  \n Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for publication.  \n In addition to declaring the topics which are relevant for their submissions, authors will be asked to declare the research methods employed in their submissions. This will enable us to ensure reviewer expertise both for research methods and topics. For full definitions of the research methods, see the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards  .  \n Double-Anonymous Review Process   \n In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:  \n Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. \n  Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”. \n  Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Authors are still encouraged to follow open science principles and submit replication packages, see more details on the open science policy below. \n  Authors should anonymize author-revealing company names but instead provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper. \n  Authors should ensure that paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of their work. \n  While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025. \n  During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . \n  The double-anonymous process used this year is “heavy”, i.e., the paper anonymity will be maintained during all reviewing and discussion periods. In case of major revision, authors must therefore maintain anonymity in their response letter and must provide no additional information that could be author-revealing.  \n To facilitate double-anonymous reviewing, we recommend the authors to postpone publishing their submitted work on arXiv or similar sites until after the notification  . If the authors have uploaded to arXiv or similar, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2025.  \n Authors with further questions on double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the program chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-anonymous review process will be desk-rejected.  \n Submission Policies   \n The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ including the following points:  \n “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” \n  “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” \n  Please read the full policy and FAQ.  \n Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism  and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions  .  \n To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare the submissions with related conferences that have overlapping review periods. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g. arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software.  \n All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy  .  \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  \n Alleged violations to any of the above policies will be reported to ACM for further investigation and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per the ACM Publications Policies.  \n Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process if your paper is accepted. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and they have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. ACM is committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n The authors of accepted papers are invited and strongly encouraged to attend the conference to present their work. Attendance at the event is not mandatory for publication. Authors also have the option of not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not need to register.  \n Important Dates   \n All dates are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12h)  \n Paper registration: | September 5, 2024 | (to register a paper, paper title, abstract, author list, and some additional metadata are required; title and abstract | must | contain sufficient information for effective bidding; registrations containing empty or generic title and abstract may be dropped) \n  Full paper submission: | September 12, 2024 \n  Author response: | November 22-26, 2024 \n  Initial notification: January 14, 2024 (long discussion period due to year-end holidays) \n  Revised manuscript submissions (major revisions only): February 25, 2025 \n  Final notification for major revisions: April 1, 2025 \n  Camera ready: April 24, 2025 \n  The official publication date is the date the journal issue is made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be as early as July 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. Please also note that the names and list of authors as well as the title in the camera-ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version unless there is explicit approval from the track chairs.  \n Open Science Policy   \n The research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.  \n Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to make a replication package available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to a private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, authors are asked to indicate whether they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the availability of a replication package (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. Be careful that such statements continue to maintain author anonymity. For more details, see the FSE open science policy  .  \n Authors of accepted papers will be given an opportunity (and encouragement) to submit their data and tools to the separate FSE’25 artifact evaluation committee.  \n Topics of Interest   \n Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  \n Artificial intelligence and machine learning for software engineering \n  Autonomic computing \n  Debugging and fault localization \n  Dependability, safety, and reliability \n  Distributed and collaborative software engineering \n  Embedded software, safety-critical systems, and cyber-physical systems \n  Empirical software engineering \n  Human and social aspects of software engineering \n  Human-computer interaction \n  Mining software repositories \n  Mobile development \n  Model checking \n  Model-driven engineering \n  Parallel, distributed, and concurrent systems \n  Performance engineering \n  Program analysis \n  Program comprehension \n  Program repair \n  Program synthesis \n  Programming languages \n  Recommendation systems \n  Requirements engineering \n  Search-based software engineering \n  Services, components, and cloud \n  Software architectures \n  Software engineering education \n  Software engineering for machine learning and artificial intelligence \n  Software evolution \n  Software processes \n  Software security \n  Software testing \n  Software traceability \n  Symbolic execution \n  Tools and environments \n\n FAQ  \n   \n FAQ on Review Process: Major Revisions, Open Science Policy, Double-Anonymous Reviewing   \n PACMSE Proceedings   \n Q: What paper format shall we follow for FSE 2025?   \n A: Papers accepted by the technical track of FSE 2025 will be published in the inaugural journal issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE). Approval has been granted by ACM in late July. Please check the Research Paper How to Submit  section for details.  \n Q: How would the inaugural PACMSE journal affect FSE 2025?   \n A: FSE will be published in the inaugural PACMSE journal following the recent practices of other communities such as PACMPL (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, etc.), PACMHCI, PACMMOD, PACMNET, etc.  \n Identity:  FSE papers will be published in a dedicated issue of PACMSE, with FSE as the issue name. This means that FSE papers will keep their identity!  \n Paper format:  The paper format will follow the ACM’s requirement. This is a switch from the traditional FSE two-column format to this new PACMSE single-column format. However, the amount of content should remain more or less the same: the FSE 2025’s 18 page limit in the singe-column format maps roughly to the old single-column of 10 pages.  \n Review process:  FSE already has a major-revision cycle in 2023 and 2024, which maps neatly onto PACMSE’s requirements for two rounds of reviews, so there are no PACMSE-related changes here.  \n Conference presentations:  FSE 2025’s move to PACMSE changes how the proceedings are published. All accepted papers will still be guaranteed presentation delivery at the conference in the usual way.  \n Policy on Authorship (e.g., regarding ChatGPT)   \n Q: What is the policy on Authorship, especially considering the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT?   \n A: Submissions must follow the “ ACM Policy on Authorship  ” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT. Please also check the ACM FAQ  which describes in what situations generative AI tools can be used (with or without acknowledgment).  \n Major Revision Process   \n Q: Why is FSE allowing major revisions?   \n A: SE conferences are currently forced to reject papers that include valuable material, but would need major changes to become acceptable for conference presentation, because major revisions cannot be accommodated in the current review process. By supporting only a binary outcome, conferences force reviewers to decide between rejection and acceptance even in borderline cases that would be better judged after a round of major revision. This can cause additional reviewing burden for the community (the paper is resubmitted to another venue with new reviewers) and inconsistency for the authors (the new reviewers have different opinions). We hope by allowing major revisions to both increase the acceptance rate of FSE and to help reduce these current problems with the reviewing process.  \n For Authors   \n Q: If my paper receives major revisions, what happens next?   \n A: The meta-review  will clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. Authors of these papers are granted 6  weeks to implement the requested changes. In addition to the revised paper, authors are asked to submit a response letter that explains how each required change was implemented. If any change was not implemented, authors can explain why. The same reviewers will then review the revised paper and make their final (binary) decision. Authors can also choose to withdraw their submission if they wish.  \n Q: Will major revision become the default decision causing initial acceptance rates to drop?   \n A: This is not the intention: reviewers are instructed to accept all papers that would have been accepted when major revision  was not an available outcome.  \n For Reviewers   \n Q: When shall I recommend major revision  for a paper?   \n A: Major revision  should not become the default choice for borderline papers and should be used only if without major revisions the paper would be rejected, while a properly done major revision, which addresses the reviewers’ concerns, could make the paper acceptable for publication; if the requested changes are doable in 6 weeks and are implementable within the page limit; if the requested changes are strictly necessary for paper acceptance (i.e., not just nice-to-have features); if the requested changes require recheck (i.e., reviewers cannot trust the authors to implement them directly in the camera ready).  \n Q: When shall I recommend rejection  instead of major revision  ?   \n A: Rejection  is a more appropriate outcome than major revision if the requested additions/changes are not implementable in 6 weeks; if the contribution is very narrow or not relevant to the SE audience, and it cannot be retargeted in 6 weeks; if the methodology is flawed and cannot be fixed in 6 weeks; if results are unconvincing, the paper does not seem to improve the state of the art much, and new convincing results are unlikely to be available after 6 weeks of further experiments; if the customary benchmark used in the community was ignored and cannot be adopted and compared to in 6 weeks.  \n Q: When shall I recommend acceptance  instead of major revision  ?   \n A: We do not want major revision to become the primary pathway for acceptance. We should continue to trust the authors to make minor changes to the submissions in the camera ready version. Acceptance  is preferable if the requested additions/changes are nice to have features, not mandatory for the acceptability of the work; if minor improvements of the text are needed; if minor clarifications requested by the reviewers should be incorporated; if important but not critical references should be added and discussed; if discussion of results could be improved, but the current one is already sufficient.  \n Q: What is the difference between major revision  and shepherding  ?   \n A: Major revision  is not shepherding  . While shepherding typically focuses on important but minor changes, which can be specified in an operational way and can be checked quite easily and quickly by reviewers, major revisions require major changes (although doable in 6 weeks), which means the instructions for the authors cannot be completely operational and the check will need to go deeply into the new content delivered by the paper. Hence, while the expectation for shepherded papers is that most of them will be accepted once the requested changes are implemented, this is not necessarily the case with major revisions.  \n Q: Is there a quota of papers that can have major revision  as outcome?  A: As there is no quota for the accepted papers, there is also no quota for major revisions. However, we expect that thanks to major revisions we will be able to eventually accept 10-15% more papers, while keeping the quality bar absolutely unchanged.  \n Q: What shall I write in the meta-review of a paper with major revision outcome?   \n A: With the possibility of a major revision  outcome, meta-reviews become extremely important. The meta-review  should clearly and explicitly list all major changes required by the reviewers to make the paper acceptable for publication. The meta-review should act as a contract between reviewers and authors, such that when all required changes are properly made, the paper is accepted. In this respect, the listed changes should be extremely clear, precise, and implementable.  \n Review Process   \n For Authors   \n Q: Can I withdraw my paper?   \n A: Yes, papers can be withdrawn at any time using HotCRP.  \n Q: Is appendix or other supplemental materials allowed?   \n A: The main submission file must follow the page limit. Any supplemental materials including appendix and replication packages must be submitted separately under “Supplemental Material”. Program Committee members can review supplemental materials but are not obligated to review them.  \n For Reviewers   \n Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity. What should I do?   \n A: Contact the Program Co-Chairs, who will download the material on your behalf and make it available to you.  \n Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?   \n A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone else. Please contact the Program Co-Chairs, especially since additional reviewers might have a different set of conflicts of interest.  \n Open Science Policy   \n Q: What is the FSE 2025 open science policy and how can I follow it?  \n A: Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Upon submission to the research track, authors are asked to:  \n make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or \n  include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and \n  indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance. This information should be provided in the submitted papers in a section named Data Availability after the Conclusion section. For more details, see the | FSE open science policy | . | Q: How can I upload supplementary material via the HotCRP site and make it anonymous for double-anonymous review? \n  A: To conform to the double-anonymous policy, please include an anonymized URL. Code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site. Instructions are provided in the FSE open science policy  .  \n Double-Anonymous Reviewing (DAR)   \n Q: Why are you using double-anonymous reviewing?   \n A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors.  \n Q: Do you really think DAR actually works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are anyway.   \n A: It is rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by expert reviewers, as detailed in this study  .  \n For Authors   \n Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?   \n A: Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are: omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person. Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. You should also avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors.  \n Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration, e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?   \n A: On the submission site, there will be an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper. You can also share supplementary material in a private or publicly shared repository (preferred). This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same double-anonymous guidelines. See instructions on the FSE open science policy  .  \n Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?   \n A: Making your code publicly available is not incompatible with double-anonymous reviewing. You can create an anonymized version of the repository and include a new URL that points to the anonymized version of the repository, similar to how you would include supplementary materials to adhere to the Open Science policy. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using https://anonymous.4open.science/  which is an open source tool that helps you to quickly double-anonymize your repository.  \n Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this system and my present submission?  A: Maybe. The core question is really whether the system is one that, once identified, automatically identifies the author(s) and/or the institution. If the system is widely available, and especially if it has a substantial body of contributors and has been out for a while, then these conditions may not hold (e.g., LLVM or HotSpot), because there would be considerable doubt about authorship. By contrast, a paper on a modification to a proprietary system (e.g., Visual C++, or a research project that has not open-sourced its code) implicitly reveals the identity of the authors or their institution. If naming your system essentially reveals your identity (or institution), then anonymize it. In your submission, point out that the system name has been anonymized. If you have any doubts, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  \n Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior work?   \n A: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for your FSE submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the prior paper. In general, there is rarely a good reason to anonymize a citation. When in doubt, contact the Program Co-Chairs.  \n Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-anonymized) paper on my web page or arXiv?   \n A: You can discuss and present your work that is under submission at small meetings (e.g., job talks, visits to research labs, a Dagstuhl or Shonan meeting), but you should avoid broadly advertising it in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it. Whenever possible, please avoid posting your manuscript on public archives (e.g, ArXiV) before or during the submission period. Would you still prefer to do so, carefully avoid adding to the manuscript any reference to FSE 2025 (e.g., using footnotes saying “Submitted to FSE 2025”).  \n Q: Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review? How do I handle social media?   \n A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone navigate in the same way the tension between the normal communication of scientific results, which double-anonymous reviewing should not impede, and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking, you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot describe every possible scenario.  \n Things you may do:  \n Put your submission on your home page. \n  Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the review committees, or with people on the committees with whom you already have a conflict. \n  Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc. \n  Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on arXiv or a similar site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-anonymous reviewing, etc. \n  Things you should not do:  \n Contact members of the review committees about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be. \n  Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community (because potential reviewers likely read these lists). \n  Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, FSE paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine. \n  Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes “going out of your way”, please contact the Program Co-Chairs.  \n Q: Will the fact that FSE is double-anonymous have an impact on handling conflicts of interest?   \n A: Double-anonymous reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the guidelines in the Call for Papers. Papers will not be assigned to reviewers who have a conflict. Note that you should not declare gratuitous conflicts of interest and the chairs will compare the conflicts declared by the authors with those declared by the reviewers. Papers abusing the system will be desk-rejected.  \n For Reviewers   \n Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do if a prospective FSE author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?  A: If you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, contact the Program Co-Chairs. Otherwise, you should not treat double-anonymous reviewing differently from other reviewing. In particular, refrain from seeking out information on the authors’ identity, but if you discover it accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a reviewer. Use your best judgement.  \n Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see the author names?   \n A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission system.  \n Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity, if I am using web-search in the process of performing my review?   \n A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith effort, please turn off Google Scholar auto-notifications. Please do not use search engines with terms like the paper’s title or the name of a new system being discussed. If you need to search for related work you believe exists, do so after completing a preliminary review of the paper.  \n The above guidelines are partly based on the PLDI FAQ on double-anonymous reviewing and the ICSE 2023 guidelines on double-anonymous submissions.  \n\n Important Dates   AoE (UTC-12h)     \n\n Tue 14 Jan 2025  \n  Initial notification \n Tue 11 Feb 2025  \n  Camera ready (directly accepted paper) \n Tue 25 Feb 2025  \n  Submission for major-revision papers \n Tue 1 Apr 2025  \n  Final notification for major revisions \n Thu 24 Apr 2025  \n  Camera ready (major revisions) \n Fri 22 - Tue 26 Nov 2024   \n  Author response \n Thu 12 Sep 2024   \n  Full paper submission \n Thu 5 Sep 2024   \n  Paper registration \n\n Submission Link   \n   \n   https://fse2025.hotcrp.com     \n   \n Program Committee    \n   \n Denys Poshyvanyk Program Co-Chair    \n William & Mary   \n United States \n  Dongmei Zhang Program Co-Chair    \n Microsoft Research   \n China \n  Iftekhar Ahmed    \n University of California at Irvine   \n United States \n  Dalal Alrajeh    \n Imperial College London   \n United Kingdom \n  Wesley Assunção    \n North Carolina State University   \n United States \n  Hamid Bagheri    \n University of Nebraska-Lincoln   \n United States \n  Guangdong Bai    \n University of Queensland   \n Australia \n  Luciano Baresi    \n Politecnico di Milano   \n Italy \n  Alexandre Bartel    \n Umeå University   \n Sweden \n  Gabriele Bavota    \n Software Institute @ Università della Svizzera Italiana   \n Switzerland \n  Dirk Beyer    \n LMU Munich   \n Germany \n  Domenico Bianculli    \n University of Luxembourg   \n Luxembourg \n  Amiangshu Bosu    \n Wayne State University   \n United States \n  Víctor Braberman    \n ICC (UBA-CONICET)   \n Argentina \n  John Businge    \n University of Nevada, Las Vegas   \n United States \n  Joanna C.

Concurrent submissions are not allowed. Papers that have been published in or accepted to any peer-reviewed journal or conference or workshop with published proceedings, or that are currently under review, or that will be submitted to other meetings or publications while under review, may not be submitted to WSDM 2025. However, submissions that are available online (e.g., on a preprint server such as Arxiv) and/or have been previously presented orally or as posters in non peer-reviewed venues with no formal proceedings, are allowed. Additionally, the ACM has a strict policy against plagiarism and self-plagiarism. All prior work must be appropriately cited. Please also see the ACM guide  on the use of Generative AI.  \n\n Format of Submissions  \n\n Manuscripts must be submitted in PDF according to the new ACM format published in ACM guidelines  (use documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}). Submissions should not exceed eight pages including any diagrams or tables, plus up to two additional pages for references and discussion of ethical considerations. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Submissions must be self-contained and in English. After uploading your submission, please verify the copy stored on the submission site. Submissions that do not follow these guidelines, or do not view or print properly, may be rejected without review.  \n PDF files submitted to WSDM 2025 must be anonymized: the submitted document should not include the author information and should not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. Explicitly revealing the manuscript authorship will result in rejection without review. Note, however, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the manuscript to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions. To this end, instead of stating, for instance, that an experiment “was conducted on the logs of a major search engine”, the authors should refer to the search engine by name. The reviewers will be informed that it does not necessarily imply that the authors are currently affiliated with the mentioned organization. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at submission time. To support faster dissemination of scientific results, we allow submissions that had earlier versions or code posted on preprint servers such as Arxiv.org or GitHub (with the understanding that these materials cannot be anonymous). In such cases, authors should exercise extra care and should not explicitly associate their submission with such publicly posted materials.  \n\n Supplementary Material  \n\n Authors may submit supplementary material (up to 100MB compressed in .zip format) containing full theoretical proofs and derivations, detailed descriptions of experimental setup, hyperparameter configurations, test datasets, or pointers to external repositories with datasets or source code, but should only do so if strict author anonymity can be maintained. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers, in other words, the paper should be self-contained as much as possible. In CMT, the option to add supplementary material will appear only after the main paper has been submitted.  \n\n Reproducibility  \n\n The resources and methods used within a manuscript should be described as completely as possible, in other words, the submitted 8+2 pages paper should be as self-contained as possible. Authors may submit supplementary material (up to 100MB compressed) containing detailed descriptions of experimental setup, hyperparameter configurations, test datasets or pointers to external repositories with datasets or code, but should only do so if strict author anonymity can be maintained. The additional content may or may not be considered when evaluating the manuscript, at the discretion of the reviewers. Wherever appropriate, the authors are encouraged to use publicly available test collections and state-of-the-art baselines, and are encouraged to share the experimental results, data, and code with the research community.  \n\n Authorship  \n\n Submitted manuscripts must adhere to the ACM authorship policy  . In particular, (i) each author must be the creator or originator of an idea in the work; (ii) each author must make substantial contributions to the work; and (iii) each author must be accountable for the work that was done and its presentation in a publication. The policy was recently updated to govern the use of generative AI tools in authoring papers.  \n If one submits numerous manuscripts to the same conference, it is less likely that one has materially contributed to all such submissions. To this end, we limit the number of submissions per author to 10 maximum. If more than 10 manuscripts are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional manuscripts submitted after the initial 10, will be rejected without review.  \n Only in exceptional cases will the PC Chairs grant permission for modifications to be made to the author list of a paper once it has been submitted and accepted.  \n\n Review Process  \n\n Each manuscript will be reviewed by at least three PC members and a senior PC member. The acceptance decisions will take into account manuscript novelty, technical depth, elegance, practical or theoretical impact, and presentation. WSDM 2025 will use a combination of single-blind reviewing and double-blind reviewing. The manuscripts will be double-blind to regular PC members, but the metadata (including authorship) of the manuscripts will be available to SPC to check for undisclosed conflicts of interest and to help assure the integrity of the review process.  \n\n ACM Instructions for Authors  \n\n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . ORCID IDs are required for all authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n\n Ethical Considerations  \n\n Submitted manuscripts should include a section on the ethical implications of the proposed research. This section will not be counted in the eight-page limit, and it should appear in the two additional pages together with the references. In this section, authors are asked to reflect and discuss the potential negative societal impact of their work, as they consider appropriate. Examples of negative societal impact include fairness considerations, privacy considerations security considerations, safety considerations, misuse of the technology by malicious actors, as well as possible harms that could arise even when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly. If there are negative societal impacts, authors should discuss appropriate mitigation strategies.  \n\n Acceptance  \n\n In case of acceptance, at least one of the authors for the paper must register for the conference. WSDM 2025 will be an in-person conference, with no provisions for remote presentations. If authors are unable to present their work for any reason, they are expected to find a proxy to present the work on their behalf. The organizers reserve the right to remove any paper that is not presented during the conference from the proceedings.  \n\n Best Papers from WSDM 2025  \n\n The 10 best papers considered by The WSDM 2025 Best Paper Award Committee will be considered to be published in TIST (ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems). The guest editors consist of the best paper award committee chair and the 3 PC chairs.  \n\n Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy  \n\n All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in CMT. You must declare a reviewer/author as a conflict of interest when the following associations exist:  \n employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months \n  candidate for employment at the same institution or company \n  received an honorarium, stipend, or grant from the institution or company within the last 12 months (except where of a modest nature, such as reimbursement of seminar expenses, honorarium for examination of a thesis, and so on). \n  co-author on book or paper in the last 24 months \n  co-principal investigator on a funded grant or research proposal in the last 24 months \n  actively working on any project together \n  family relationship or close personal relationship \n  graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation \n  deep personal animosity \n  In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere to ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy as well as the ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.  \n\n Violations of Originality, Dual Submission or Conflicts of Interest  \n\n Submitted manuscripts that do not meet the length, formatting or originality requirements, or are concurrently submitted to two venues (including manuscripts with significant overlap), are subject to desk rejection without review. At the discretion of the PC Chairs and the Steering Committee, egregious violations (including plagiarism) may lead to additional penalties such as a temporary or permanent ban from the venue and sponsoring SIGs venues, as well as an escalation to the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics (COPE). Likewise, failure of an author to disclose all COIs, or cases of a referee providing a review on a paper for which they have an undisclosed COI, may lead to similar penalties. You are encouraged to contact the PC Chairs if you have questions as to the originality conditions, dual submission, or conflict of interest policy.  \n\n Submission  \n\n Submissions to WSDM2025 are now open via CMT  . Authors are invited to submit their abstracts by August 7 and full papers by August 14.  \n\n Submission      \n\n Interested in becoming part of the PC committee?  \n\n The deadline for applying for PC membership has passed.   \n\n We welcome requests to become part of the PC committee. However, in order to minimize the communication to our PC chairs please make sure to only reach out to them if you satisfy the following criteria:  \n You have had at least 5 years of experience as a researcher \n  You have served as a reviewer for WSDM or related conferences (WSDM, WWW, SIGIR, KDD, CIKM, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, and equivalents) \n  If you do satisfy this criteria, please reach out to wsdm-2025-pc-chairs@googlegroups.com  .  \n\n © 2024, WSDM 2025.

Submissions are expected to have a strong focus on the learning and teaching of software engineering, as a topic of courses and degree programs in higher education, as well as continuing education and on-the-job training. The work should be original, demonstrating novelty either in empirical insights or educational approach.  \n Topics of interest   \n To be relevant to the conference, a paper must be original, with the innovation or research findings focussing on software engineering education. More specifically, topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  \n Innovative learning and teaching approaches for software engineering \n  Empirical studies of learning effectiveness and student satisfaction \n  Curriculum change and development in software engineering education \n  Identifying current and emerging competence needs for software engineering graduates \n  Assessment and evaluation in software engineering education \n  Enhancing soft skills of software engineering students \n  Sustainability and ethics in software engineering education \n  Tools and platforms for software engineering education \n  Games-based learning in software engineering education \n  Project-based and problem-based learning in software engineering education \n  Work-integrated learning in software engineering education \n  Continuing education and on the job-training for software engineers \n  Implications of AI on graduate competence needs \n  Usage of AI to support learning and assessment \n  Academic integrity in software engineering education \n  Addressing student well-being, belonging and equity \n  Paper categories   \n FSE 2025 wants to make the sharing of educational research as forthcoming as possible. For this reason, we provide two paper categories for the Education Track:  \n Short papers (5 pages, plus 1 page with references): Ideal for shorter contributions, such as lessons learnt from innovative educational approaches. \n  Long papers (10 pages, plus 2 pages with references): Ideal for thorough empirical research papers about software engineering education. \n  Both types of submissions should clearly identify their novel contribution to software engineering education research, either in terms of the novelty of the educational approach explored, or in the originality of the findings beyond already established knowledge.  \n Both paper types will be reviewed based on the same evaluation criteria, but short papers may have a smaller set of contributions and somewhat less validation than full papers. All accepted papers will appear in the main conference proceedings.  \n Evaluation Criteria   \n All submissions will be evaluated based on originality, significance, soundness, thoroughness of evaluation, quality of presentation, and appropriate discussion of related work. Additional key reviewing criteria for the education track are listed below.  \n Educational focus | : The paper provides original insights either on the current status of software engineering education, and/or how it could be improved. \n  Clarity and potential utility of lessons learned | : The clarity in which the lessons learned are presented, and to what extent they may be useful to other educators or educational researchers. \n  Important Dates   \n All dates are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12h)  \n Submission deadline - January 15, 2025 \n  Author notification - March 25, 2025 \n  Camera ready - April 21, 2025 \n  How to Submit   \n Submissions must be in English.  \n for short papers: 5 pages for all text and figures, plus 1 page for references. \n  for long papers: 10 pages for all text and figures plus 2 pages for references. \n  Submissions can be double-blind, but do not have to be. We leave it up to the authors to judge whether they want to include their names, affiliation, and the company in which the work was performed.  \n At the time of submission, all papers must conform to the FSE 2025 Format and Submission Guidelines  .  \n Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 Education submission site: https://fse2025-seet.hotcrp.com/   \n Guttorm Sindre (co-chair)  \n  Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)  \n  Trondheim, Norway  \n Xiaofeng Wang (co-chair)  \n  Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Unibz)  \n  Bolzano, Italy  \n\n Important Dates   AoE (UTC-12h)     \n\n Wed 15 Jan 2025  \n  Submission deadline \n Tue 25 Mar 2025  \n  Author notification \n Mon 21 Apr 2025  \n  Camera ready \n\n Submission Link   \n   \n   https://fse2025-seet.hotcrp.com     \n   \n Program Committee    \n   \n Guttorm Sindre Co-chair    \n Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)   \n Norway \n  Xiaofeng Wang Co-chair    \n Free University of Bozen-Bolzano   \n Italy \n  Meghan Allen    \n University of British Columbia   \n Canada \n  Roy Andersson    \n Lund University   \n Sweden \n  Andreas Bollin    \n University of Klagenfurt, Austria   \n Austria \n  Kevin Buffardi    \n California State University, Chico   \n United States \n  Jürgen Börstler    \n Blekinge Institute of Technology   \n Sweden \n  Igor Cavrak    \n University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing   \n Croatia \n  Youyou Cong    \n Institute of Science Tokyo   \n Japan \n  Mats Daniels    \n University of Uppsala   \n Sweden \n  Marian Daun    \n Technical University of Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt   \n Germany \n  Giuseppe Destefanis    \n Brunel University London \n  Rodrigo Santos    \n UNIRIO   \n Brazil \n  Morgan Ericsson    \n Linnaeus University   \n Sweden \n  Shang Gao    \n Örebro University   \n Sweden \n  Isabella Graßl    \n University of Passau   \n Germany \n  Iris Groher    \n Johannes Kepler University, Linz   \n Austria \n  Arto Hellas    \n Aalto University   \n Finland \n  Johan Jeuring    \n Utrecht University   \n Netherlands \n  Stan Kurkovsky    \n Central Connecticut State University   \n United States \n  Seonah Lee    \n Gyeongsang National University   \n South Korea \n  Shanshan Li    \n Nanjing University   \n China \n  Grischa Liebel    \n Reykjavik University   \n Iceland \n  Tiziana Margaria    \n University of Limerick and Lero - The Irish Software Research Centre   \n Ireland \n  Marques Samary Maíra    \n Boston College   \n United States \n  Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer    \n University of Michigan - Flint   \n United States \n  Elisa Yumi Nakagawa    \n University of São Paulo   \n Brazil \n  Emily Navarro    \n University of California, Irvine   \n United States \n  Candy Pang    \n MacEwan University   \n Canada \n  Upsorn Praphamontripong    \n University at Albany   \n United States \n  Prajish Prasad    \n FLAME University   \n India \n  Maria Paasivaara    \n LUT University, Finland & Aalto University, Finland   \n Finland \n  Mary Sánchez-Gordón    \n Østfold University College   \n Norway \n  Jean-Guy Schneider    \n Monash University   \n Australia \n  Cristina Seceleanu    \n Mälardalen University   \n Sweden \n  Yvonne Sedelmaier    \n SRH university of applied sciences \n  Jacqueline Staub    \n University of Trier   \n Germany \n  Claudia Szabo    \n The University of Adelaide   \n Australia \n  Bastian Tenbergen    \n State University of New York at Oswego   \n United States \n  Laura Tubino    \n Deakin University \n  Jan Vahrenhold    \n University of Münster   \n Germany \n  Roberto Verdecchia    \n University of Florence   \n Italy \n  Andreea Vescan    \n Babes-Bolyai University   \n Romania \n  Aurora Vizcaíno    \n Universidad de Castilla - La Mancha   \n Spain \n  Hironori Washizaki    \n Waseda University   \n Japan \n  Nelly Condori-Fernández    \n Universidad de Santiago de Compostela   \n Spain \n  Anh Nguyen Duc    \n University College of Southeast Norway   \n Norway \n  Viktoria Stray    \n SINTEF Digital   \n Norway \n\n x  Mon 2 Dec 14:34    \n\n  FSE 2025   \n  contact form    \n  using conf.researchr.org  ( v1.67.1  )  \n   Support page    \n     \n Tracks  \n How to Submit   \n  Research Papers   \n  Industry Papers   \n  Ideas, Visions and Reflections   \n  Journal First   \n  Student Research Competition   \n  Demonstrations   \n  Posters   \n  Artifacts   \n  Doctoral Symposium   \n  New Faculty Symposium   \n  Software Engineering Education   \n  Tutorials   \n  Student Volunteers   \n  Industry Mentoring Symposium   \n  Workshops   \n  Open Science Policy    \n Workshops  \n AI IDE 2025    \n\n Attending  \n Venue: Clarion Hotel Trondheim   \n  Diversity and Inclusion Plan   \n  Code of Conduct"

The format is derived from the ACM template's sample-sigconf.tex file, and is used with an objective of keeping the submission version similar to the camera ready version. In an effort to respect the efforts of reviewers and in the interest of fairness to all prospective authors, we request that all submissions to ISCA 2025 follow the formatting and submission rules detailed below. Submissions that violate these instructions may not be reviewed, at the discretion of the program chairs, in order to maintain a review process that is fair to all potential authors.  \n\n  Paper Evaluation Objectives  \n The committee will make every effort to judge each submitted paper on its own merits. There will be no target acceptance rate. We expect to accept a wide range of papers with appropriate expectations for evaluation – while papers that build on significant past work with strong evaluations are valuable, papers that open new areas with less rigorous evaluation are equally welcome and especially encouraged. We also acknowledge the wide range of evaluation methodologies in ISCA including modeling, simulation, prototyping, experimental implementation, real product evaluation, etc.  \n\n  Paper Formatting  \n Papers must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain a maximum of 11 pages  of single-spaced two-column text, not including references  . You may include any number of pages for references, but see below for more instructions. If you are using LaTeX to typeset your paper, then we suggest that you use the ISCA 2025 ACM template  . The sample paper  was prepared with that template. The general ACM templates (Latex, Microsoft Word or Overleaf) can be accessed here  .  \n Please ensure that you include page numbers with your submission.  This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different parts of your paper when they provide comments. Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the title page, which contains the submission number and the notice of confidentiality.  \n\n  View Sample Paper    \n\n Field | Value \n Page Limit | 11 pages, not including references \n File Format | PDF \n Paper Size | US Letter: 8.5in x 11in \n References | no page limit, list all authors' names \n\n  Content  \n Reviewing will be double blind  : please do not include any author names on any submitted documents except in the space provided on the submission form. You must also ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the authors. If you are improving upon your prior work, refer to your prior work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography. For example, if you are building on your own  prior work in the papers, you would say something like: “While the authors of [x][y] did X, Y, and Z, this paper additionally does W and is therefore much better.” Do NOT omit or anonymize references for blind review. There is one exception to this for your own prior work that appeared in IEEE CAL, arXiv, workshops without archived proceedings, etc., as discussed later in this document.  \n Figures and Tables  \n Ensure that the figures and tables are legible. Please also ensure that you refer to your figures in the main text. Many reviewers print the papers in gray-scale. Therefore, if you use colors for your figures, ensure that the different colors are highly distinguishable in grayscale.  \n References  \n There is no length limit for references. Each reference must explicitly list all authors of the paper. Papers not meeting this requirement will be rejected. Authors of NSF proposals should be familiar with this requirement. Knowing all authors of related work will help find the best reviewers. Since there is no length limit for the number of pages used for references, there is no need to save space here.  \n\n  Paper Submission Instructions  \n Guidelines for Determining Authorship  \n ACM guidelines dictate that authorship should be based on a substantial intellectual contribution.  It is assumed that all authors have had a significant role in the creation of an article that bears their names. In particular, the authorship credit must be reserved only for individuals who have met each of the following conditions:  \n Made a significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical development, system or experimental design, prototype development, and/or the analysis and interpretation of data associated with the work contained in the article; \n  Contributed to drafting the article or reviewing and/or revising it for intellectual content; and \n  Approved the final version of the article as accepted for publication, including references. \n  A detailed description of the ACM authorship guidelines and responsibilities is available here  . Per these guidelines, it is not acceptable to award honorary authorship or gift authorship. Please keep these guidelines in mind while determining the author list of your paper.  \n Declaring Authors  \n Declare all the authors of the paper upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the paper is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment.  \n Areas and Topics  \n Authors should indicate these areas on the submission form as well as specific topics covered by the paper for optimal reviewer match. If you are unsure whether your paper falls within the scope of ISCA, please check with the program chairs – ISCA is a broad multidisciplinary conference and encourages new topics.  \n Declaring Conflicts of Interest  \n Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected.  \n Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper. A conflict occurs in the following cases:  \n Between advisors and advisees, forever. \n  Between family members, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). \n  Between people who have collaborated in the last FIVE years. This collaboration can consist of a joint research or development project, a joint paper, or when there is direct funding from the potential reviewer (as opposed to company funding) to an author of the paper. Co-participation in professional activities, such as tutorials or studies, is not cause for conflict. When in doubt, the author should check with the | program chairs | . \n  Between people from the same institution or who were in the same institution in the last FIVE years. \n  Between people whose relationship prevents the reviewer from being objective in his/her assessment. \n  \"Service\" collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects.  \n On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration which has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The program chairs may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.  \n Most reviews will be solicited among the members of the program committee and the external review committee but other members from the community may also write reviews. Please declare all your conflicts (not just restricted to the PC and ERC)  on the submission form. When in doubt, contact the program chairs.  \n Concurrent Submissions and Workshops  \n By submitting a manuscript to ISCA 2025, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference journal, or the archived proceedings of a workshop (e.g., in the ACM/IEEE digital library) – see exceptions below. The authors also guarantee that no paper that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper will be under review for any other conference or journal or an archived proceedings of a workshop during the ISCA 2025 review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection.  \n The only exceptions to the above rules are for the authors' own papers in (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM/IEEE digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL or arXiv where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. In all such cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the above work to preserve author anonymity. This information must, however, be provided on the submission form – the PC chair will make this information available to reviewers if it becomes necessary to ensure a fair review. If you have already put your manuscript on arXiv, in the interest of double blind review, modify the title for the version you submit to ISCA. As always, if you are in doubt, it is best to contact the program chairs  .  \n Finally, the ACM Plagiarism Policy  and the IEEE Plagiarism Policy  cover a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one's own work.  \n\n  Additional Rules for Authors  \n Authors MUST:  \n Abide by the ACM code of ethics and the IEEE code of ethics. \n  Abide by the criterion for authorship laid out by ACM and IEEE. Authorship is reserved only for individuals making substantial intellectual contributions. Gifting authorship is strictly prohibited. \n  List all legitimate CoIs and only legitimate CoIs. Asking someone for feedback on a draft of the paper or discussing the idea with someone does not create a CoI. \n  Abide by the Concurrent Submission Policy (see above). \n  Anonymize their submission for double-anonymous reviewing. This means not having any author names on any submitted documents, including in PDF metadata, except in the space provided on the submission form. If referring to one’s work, authors must do so in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography. References must not be omitted or anonymized. \n  Fully anonymize any link to artifacts produced by them concerning the submission (e.g., GitHub repository). Remove any links to artifacts that cannot be fully anonymized. \n  Report any allegations of submission or reviewing misconduct to the Program Chairs, who has the responsibility to follow up on them. The only exception is if the complaint is about the Program Chairs; in this case, the Steering Committee should be contacted. \n  Make no assumptions as to whether a particular paper represents a “community paper” and whether its co-authors are or are not conflicted with each other. The decision rests entirely with the Program Chairs, who must be either petitioned explicitly or will be presented with the choice through a conflict-tracking tool. A community paper is defined as a paper presenting a survey, compendium, tool, or artifact to which multiple authors contribute without engaging in an actual project collaboration (e.g., a paper describing an open-source software framework to which the authors have contributed different modules). \n  Authors MUST NOT:  \n Contact reviewers or PC members about any submission, including their own. This includes asking about the outcome of a submission following the online discussion period and the PC meeting. Similarly, authors are not allowed to ask another party to contact the reviewers on their behalf. \n  List potential reviewers as conflicts of interest based solely on fear or suspicion of a negative bias. If an author believes there exists clear and articulable evidence of a negative bias against their work from a potential reviewer, the author may contact the Program Chairs and present such evidence in support of their case. The Program Chairs must acknowledge receipt and may solicit additional information. The Program Chairs are not required to notify the authors of any decision taken. \n  Attempt to sway a reviewer to review any paper positively or negatively. \n  Contact reviewers or PC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted papers. \n  Disclose the content of reviews for one’s paper publicly before the results are announced. Any grievances should be directed to the Program Chairs. \n\n  Acknowledgments  \n This document is derived from previous conferences, in particular ISCA 2024.  \n\n  © International Symposium on Computer Architecture   \n IEEE Privacy Policy"

The 18th ACM International WSDM Conference will take place in Hannover, Germany (in-person conference) between March 10th to 14th, 2025.  \n The Industry Day event will take place on the first day of the WSDM conference, Monday, March 10th, 2025.  \n The WSDM Industry Chairs are inviting submissions for technical talks that cover the usage of web search and data mining in an industrial setting. The talks may address challenges, solutions, and case studies of interesting and innovative systems as well as applied research in relevant areas. The theme this year is: Large Language Models in Industrial Settings. Particular consideration will be given to talk proposals that are relevant to the theme.  \n Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  \n Challenges, applications, and foundational advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for industrial applications \n  User behavior patterns and insights as demonstrated in large-scale web search and data mining applications \n  Building and optimizing modeling pipelines for high throughput and low latency production systems to deliver business impact. \n  Case studies addressing practical challenges such as data, privacy, ethics, integrity, scale, and regulation. \n\n Submission Guidelines  \n\n Presentation proposals should be 1 to 2 pages (including references) and follow the ACM format. Formatting guidelines are available at this ACM publication site  (use the ˮsigconf” proceedings template, two-column format).  \n Please include:  \n Title \n  Abstract \n  Outline of the presentation \n  A brief company portrait (~60 words) \n  A short bio of the main presenter (~100 words) \n  WSDM is a technical conference, so preference will be given to talks describing novel applications of existing or new research in industrial settings, and technical challenges in applying novel research at industrial scale. Please do NOT submit a sales speech or a product description that does not contain any novel research, novel application of existing research, and novel insights into solving challenging problems at industrial scale!  \n Proposals should be submitted electronically via Easychair: https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=wsdmindustrytrack202   \n\n Presentation and Publication  \n\n The presentation format will be decided based on submissions and interest to the wider community, and is likely to be a mix of short and long presentations as well as panels.   \n WSDM 2025 is an in-person conference. At least one author of each accepted presentation needs to register and present the work at the WSDM 2025 Industry Day. All talks should be delivered in person.   \n The authors of accepted proposals will be invited to submit a camera-ready copy to be included in the proceedings.   \n\n © 2024, WSDM 2025.

The ISCA Industry Track was established under a different vision and motive to bringing the values, trends, and perspectives of real hardware product and system design from the industries. It also serves as a venue to encourage more participation from industries to interact with academia for forward-looking research challenges and solutions.

The review process will follow common practice to avoid conflicts of interest. \n  All submissions to the industry track must follow | general submission guidelines | (including font and page limits). | Submissions that fail to abide by the guidelines will be rejected without review. \n  Select submission may be considered for an upcoming IEEE Micro Special Issue. \n\n  Important Dates  \n Abstract Deadline: | January 3, 2025 at 11:59 PM EST \n  Full Paper Deadline: | January 10, 2025 at 11:59 PM EST \n  Rebuttal/Revision period: | March 3 - 7, 2025 \n  Note: 1) The program committee recognizes that industry papers need to be approved by management (often involving multiple rounds of redaction) before they can be submitted, and there can be restrictions about filing patents before submitting a paper. Therefore, a later deadline is adopted to increase the chances of receiving such papers. 2) The 2025 ISCA industrial session will include a lighter weight rebuttal process to maximize industry submissions as well industry involvement in the review process.  \n\n  Topics of Interest  \n Paper topics are not limited to hardware tapeouts. Papers that are software-centric papers relevant to the ISCA audience are welcome in this track (e.g. datacenter software work, compiler work, accelerator software stack work), but they should adhere to the tenet that they must be industry papers about production-level work - whether retrospective, planned and on the roadmap, or planned but canceled.  \n Processors, SoCs, GPUs, and domain-specific accelerators \n  Systems and interconnect technologies for HPC, cloud, or data centers \n  Embedded, mobile, and IoT processors \n  FPGA or reconfigurable architectures \n  Storage and emerging memory systems \n  Architectures using emerging technology \n  Architectures for emerging applications including generative AI and bioinformatics \n  Architectures for commercialization of quantum computing \n\n   © International Symposium on Computer Architecture   \n IEEE Privacy Policy"

Its annual conference, first held in 1974, is the premier conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques worldwide. At SIGGRAPH 2025, we boldly look toward the future, imagining how humanity and technology will be increasingly connected and examining how we can create a future that connects our physical and digital worlds for the better.  \n\n Join Us  \n Where  \n Vancouver Convention Centre  \n  1055 Canada Place  \n  Vancouver, BC, Canada  \n  + Virtual Access  \n When  \n 10–14 August  \n\n   A Message From the Conference Chair  \n Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  \n Every day we find ourselves more deeply immersed in the technology we create. Where computers and data once existed apart from us, they are now interwoven in our lives, powered by the drive of human expression, creativity, and need. The relationship between humanity and technology transforms our world, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. As a community of excellence in technical skill and artistry, we at SIGGRAPH can lead this transformation by shaping a future that unites the physical and digital worlds for the better.  \n At SIGGRAPH 2025, we stand at the forefront of this progress, embracing it, sharing it, and creating it. We are not just passive participants — we are active co-creators of the future. From the art we bring to life, to the stories we tell across media and unprecedented levels of immersion transforming how we experience the world, SIGGRAPH 2025 is a celebration of our collective drive to connect, comprehend, and express the essence of human experience.  \n Storytelling has always fueled technological breakthroughs, and together, we are writing the next chapter in a legacy that spans over five decades. For 52 years, SIGGRAPH has nurtured the brightest minds and boldest ideas in computer graphics and interactive techniques. And this year, we return to Vancouver, whose modern, urban landscape meets an inspiring nature setting, reminding us that technology, at its best, complements and enhances the natural world.  \n We are thrilled to welcome you to SIGGRAPH 2025, where you will discover and embrace how human ingenuity and technological marvels unite to shape our trajectory toward a better future.  \n\n   Engage With New Perspectives  \n Participate  \n Play an active role in shaping our collective technological future.

This core conference program features researchers who unveil the most esteemed breakthroughs that contribute to shaping and improving our collective future.  \n\n Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025  \n Submit to Technical Papers  \n The SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers program spans areas including but not limited to animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, generative AI,  and machine learning for visual computing.  \n Building a desirable future through computer graphics and interactive techniques starts with you and your contributions to and participation in SIGGRAPH 2025. We are excited that you are submitting your paper for consideration.  \n At SIGGRAPH 2025, the Technical Papers program will have two integrated paper tracks: Journal ( ACM Transactions on Graphics  ) and Conference.  \n Journal Papers | are expected to satisfy the ACM TOG criteria of excellence established over the years, and present novel, well validated, and comprehensively described research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. Papers accepted to the Journal track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 issue of | ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG). \n  Conference Papers | are expected to present novel research advancing computer graphics and interactive techniques. However, the evidence supporting these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. The length of papers accepted to this track is | capped | as outlined in the “Journal vs. Conference” table below. Papers accepted to the conference track will be published in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Proceedings. \n  At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal track only  or whether they want the submission to be considered for both tracks, i.e., as a “dual-track submission.”   \n The review process, deadline, an   d papers committee are the same for both tracks. Papers considered for both tracks are first evaluated to determine if the contribution is of sufficient quality for SIGGRAPH. If judged to be of sufficient quality, they are then assessed based on the criteria above to determine the track to be accepted into.    \n The differences in the submission process for the two options are outlined below.   \n Journal-Only Submissions   \n The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    \n Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  \n When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   \n No maximum (or minimum) page length.  \n Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  \n   \n Dual-Track Submissions   \n The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    \n The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  \n When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. No limit on the length or file size of supplementary materials.   \n The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages  excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages  , placed at the end of the submission, after references. Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Papers should not include appendices in the main document.  \n Published in SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings  \n\n Journal-Only Submissions   \n   \n Dual Track Submissions   \n\n The submitted work is expected to be novel and advance the state of the art.    \n   \n Ideas are extensively tried and tested, and the paper is complete and comprehensive.  \n   \n The work can be less complete (e.g., have shorter validation and fewer comparisons).  \n\n When submitting, use the “acmtog” article style, double column. The file size of supplementary materials is limited to 500MB.    \n   \n No maximum (or minimum) page length.  \n   \n The submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the references. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the paper PDF, after references. Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their captions (i.e., no tables). Authors can include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Appendices are to be provided as supplemental material, and not part of the paper itself.  \n\n Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  \n   \n If accepted as a Conference Paper: Published in SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings  \n If accepted as a Journal Paper: Published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)  \n\n Richard Zhang   \n  SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair   \n Adriana Schulz   \n  SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Assistant Chair   \n\n How to Submit  \n     \n  To start, read the information below about how to prepare your submission, including information on formatting, anonymity, and resubmissions. Then log into the Submission Portal    , select the “New Submission” tab, and select the Technical Papers submission form. You will be asked for basic information about your submission.  \n To see what you will need to submit, view the Sample Form    (Stage 1). Creating a submission form will assign your submission a paper ID, which must be included in your submitted paper.  \n Deadlines   \n All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted.  \n Thursday, 16 January 2025: Submission form deadline   \n Deadline for creating the submission form with the title, complete list of co-authors, as well as the specification of conflicts of interest (COI) for each co-author. Note that once the paper is submitted, the list of authors can no longer be edited  . Exceptions can be made in special circumstances but are expected to be rare and are up to the discretion of the Technical Papers Chair.  \n Thursday, 23 January 2025: Paper deadline   \n Deadline for the complete submission, including either the actual PDF paper or an MD5 checksum (which will be required in lieu of the actual files starting at some point on this day). If you wish to submit supplemental material (additional details or comparisons, movies, code, data, etc.) as well, these files (or their MD5 checksums) must also be uploaded by this date and time. To see what you will need to submit, view the sample form    (Stage 2).  \n Friday, 24 January 2025: Upload deadline   \n Deadline for uploading all materials if you used MD5 checksums  . No new or changed material may be uploaded. Only files matching MD5 checksums submitted the previous day are valid.  \n English Review Service   \n Non-native English speakers may optionally use the English Review Service    to help improve the text of submissions. Please note that this process takes time, so plan far ahead in order to meet the submission deadline.  \n   \n Back to Top    \n\n Review Process  \n     \n  All submitted papers (independent of the track they are submitted to) will receive four full reviews plus one meta review, all double-blind, and will be evaluated by the Technical Papers Committee.  \n When deciding which track a dual-track submission is suitable for, reviewers will be instructed to consider how compelling the evidence supporting the advances presented in the paper is when assessing the track the paper should be accepted to. In particular, they will be instructed to be less demanding about formal completeness, validation, and experimental evaluation when it comes to accepting papers to the Conference track, thereby allowing publication of riskier/earlier-stage work.  \n Both tracks will continue the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program from previous years, publishing high-quality, groundbreaking, and impactful research that is presented at SIGGRAPH. Journal Papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Graphics  . Conference Papers will be published in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  \n   \n Back to Top    \n\n Submission Policy  \n     \n  Double Submissions   \n By submitting a manuscript to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review or will be submitted to any peer-reviewed venue during the SIGGRAPH review period. Violations constitute grounds for immediate rejection. If you wish to submit revised or extended versions of Conference or workshop Papers, please directly submit to TOG instead of SIGGRAPH.  \n Plagiarism   \n A submission to the SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications, but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, as well as other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection. For more details, please consult the guidance    provided by ACM.  \n Anonymity   \n The SIGGRAPH review process is fully double-blind: The committee members and external reviewers do not know the identity of the authors, and the authors do not know the identity of the reviewers. This anonymity is an integral part of an objective and fair review process, so authors are required to take all reasonable measures to preserve their anonymity. Specific instructions for preserving anonymity in your submission are discussed in the Submission Requirements  section. Rules on how to preserve anonymity before and after submission when communicating about the work with others are set forth in the SIGGRAPH 2025 anonymity policy   . Authors are expected to familiarize themselves with the policy and strictly adhere to it.  \n Citing And Comparison to Prior Art, including Prepublications   \n Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable and feasible, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue before the SIGGRAPH submission deadline. This also applies to patents, which undergo a professional reviewing process. While quantitative and qualitative comparisons to published results can be reasonably requested by reviewers, authors are NOT required to compare to methods without published code or data, e.g., by reimplementing the methods.  \n Prepublications include technical reports, and other non-peer-reviewed publications, especially papers posted on arXiv. With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these prepublications imposes an unreasonable burden: a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. While peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers.  \n Consequently, authors are not  required to discuss and compare their work with recent prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite  those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism”  above). We nevertheless encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these prepublications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these prepublications. Authors may want to upload as supplementary material anonymized versions of any relevant tech report or arXiv posting of their own, if the work can be perceived to have overlap, in terms of contribution, with the submission.  \n Citing Own Prior Art   \n When citing already published work by the same (or an overlapping) group of authors, the citation should refer to that work in the third person, just as it would refer to any other previously published work by a completely different set of authors. For other relevant work from the same author(s) as the submission, we distinguish between two cases: (A) works that have been submitted for publication elsewhere, but have some relevance to and/or overlap with the submission; and (B) largely overlapping prepublications that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv, technical report, thesis, etc.).  \n For case (A), the other work (e.g., tech report, arXiv posting) should be cited anonymously, as well as provided as anonymous supplementary material. The authors must convince the reviewers that the current submission is sufficiently different from the other work, which can be done using an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences. \n  For case (B), these earlier or largely similar versions of the submission that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) should | NOT | be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. Instead, these prepublications must be listed in the appropriate field of the submission form, titled “Prepublication.” This field is not visible to reviewers. \n  Ethics   \n Computer graphics have an increasing societal impact. Authors should be aware of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct   and adhere to it. Authors should also adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   if human subjects are involved in their research. The Technical Papers Committee will judge each submission solely based on its technical merits and novelty. If a submission that the Technical Papers Committee recommends to accept raises an ethical issue, it will be forwarded to a relevant ACM body for ethics evaluation. This body can recommend changes to the submission or, in extreme cases, rejecting the work. The Technical Papers Chair will take the final decision in these cases.  \n Lobbying Reviewers   \n It is strictly prohibited to make any attempt to intervene in the review process. For example, it is inappropriate for an author to contact a committee member or a person they suspect to be a reviewer during the review process and mention the author’s own submission, even if the author does not explicitly ask for a favor. Committee members and reviewers will be asked to report such incidents and subsequently may be marked as conflicted and removed from the review process for that submission. For the most serious interventions, the submission may be rejected without completing the review process.  \n   \n Back to Top    \n\n Submission Requirements  \n     \n  Submission Format   \n Technical Papers authors should prepare their documents according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines    . All submissions should be prepared in ACM double-column format. For convenience, we recommend using the provided “acmtog” LaTeX Article Template Style, which is already in the correct format. The other templates (e.g., Word, Overleaf) might need adaptation to obtain double-column format. Please pay particular attention to the citation format for prior ACM SIGGRAPH Conference Papers, as specified in the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines, because the proper format varies depending on the year of publication.  \n If you use LaTeX, please anonymize your initial submission with the following \\documentclass command:  \n \\documentclass[acmtog,anonymous,review]{acmart}  \n and add your assigned paper ID with:  \n \\acmSubmissionID{paper ID}  \n Authors who use LaTeX must make certain that any packages they use in their paper are part of ACM’s list of accepted LaTeX packages — https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages  . TAPS will reject submissions that use packages that are not part of this list. Authors can request that packages be added — see the documentation for information on that request process.  \n Please use the same formatting for both Journal and dual-track submissions.  For dual-track submissions, please follow the instructions in the section below regarding paper length and organization. Papers that do not conform to these instructions will not be considered for the conference track and may be desk rejected.  \n Please ensure that you are using version 2.09 or higher of the “acmart” class; earlier versions of the article template will not produce a valid submission. Download the latest acmart class along with other necessary materials here    . A LaTeX submission template    is provided for your convenience.  \n Authors are required to submit fully formatted papers, with graphs, images, and other special areas arranged as intended for final publication, using the ACM SIGGRAPH paper preparation guidelines. Be sure that all pages are numbered and contain your paper’s ID number. You should obtain this paper ID by completing the Online Submission Form before finalizing your paper. If your paper is accepted, you will receive instructions for formatting the final version, which will be different because, among other things, the authors’ names and affiliations will be included, and the pages will not be numbered.  \n Authors must submit their papers electronically. The only allowable format is Adobe PDF. We prefer that authors upload supplemental materials (anything except the paper) electronically, but physical submission is also possible. If there is some reason why electronic submission is impossible for you, please contact us via the Technical Papers Email Contact Form    well before the deadline. See How to Submit  for more information. For videos, we strongly encourage MP4, and for still images, we strongly encourage JPG or PNG. If you use another format, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will view them. In preparing videos, please choose a reasonable frame size and rate, but be prepared to submit a higher-resolution video if a section of your video is selected for the Papers Preview section of the Electronic Theater. If your supplemental materials amount to more than 100 MB of data, you are not guaranteed that reviewers will download and view them.  \n Preserving Anonymity in the Submission   \n Remove any information from your submission materials (paper, video, images, data, code, etc.) that identifies you, any of the other authors, and any of your institutions or places of work. In addition to not listing your names and affiliations in the paper, please omit acknowledgements (you will be able to add them back upon acceptance). If you are a well-known author with a possibly recognizable voice, do not narrate your video; get someone else to do it. You must reference all relevant work completely, including your own and that of the other authors. The detailed policy on how to cite these papers, including prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, etc.), theses, submitted work, and published work, is described in the “Citing Own Prior Art” section in the Submission Policy. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your work.  \n We strongly discourage authors from including any URLs referring to websites that contain vital material for their submissions, with the exception of fully anonymized code/data that has to be accessed through an external link. We still prefer that the code/data is submitted as part of the supplementary material. The main reason is that accessing external websites runs a high risk of breaking anonymity, which will lead to desk rejections. SIGGRAPH reviewers are instructed to ignore URLs in paper submissions unless the information is deemed absolutely necessary for their review. Such decisions are made completely at the reviewers’ discretion.  \n Please keep the PDF version anonymous; in particular, note that under some operating systems the “properties” of a PDF file may contain the creator’s name. Also, Version 7 PDF files allow inclusion of a script that will contact the author each time the file is opened. Do not include this script in your PDF file; if we find it, we will reject your paper without review. Make sure that no submitted files contain any information about the authors in the metadata.  \n Paper Length   \n Journal-only submissions have no maximum (or minimum) length. Have a look at previous proceedings to get a sense of the range of paper lengths, where typical lengths are between 8 and 12 pages, not including references, though the variation is large. For Journal Papers that are conditionally accepted, the final paper length may increase when approved by the primary reviewer.  \n Dual-track submissions are required to adhere to the following length constraints: Papers must be no longer than 7 pages excluding references and figures-only pages. There is no limit on the length of the reference section. Each paper can have at most two figures-only pages, placed at the end of the submission, after references.  Figures-only pages can contain only figures and their caption (i.e., no tables). Authors can also include as many figures as they wish within the core 7 pages. Any appendix can only be included as supplementary material and not part of the main paper.  Papers will not be considered for conference publication if they exceed the page limit, are not submitted using the formatting described in the section “Submission Format,” or appear to alter the format to bypass the page limit. Post-acceptance, authors of papers accepted to the Conference track can add one additional page to the final-format papers to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, copyright, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still needs to fulfill the length requirements discussed before).  \n The submitted paper should stand on its own, allowing evaluation of the main ideas without reliance on supplemental material. For example, main results and discussion of the method must be in the submission; extra ablation studies, additional comparisons, implementation details, and similar material can be provided in the supplemental material. Animated results may be included as an accompanying video.  \n For all submissions, clarity of writing is considered vital to a high-quality submission. Papers may be perceived as too long if they are repetitive or verbose or too short if they omit important details or neglect relevant prior art.  \n Companion Videos   \n Papers may be accompanied by a video that is five minutes or less in duration. In recent years, well over half of the accepted papers were accompanied by some kind of video material. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the video providing supplementary information or visual confirmation of results. However, it is fine to refer to the video in the paper, in which case the video should be submitted under Supplementary Materials, part A in the submission form, as described below. A video should not be included in a submission unless substantively similar footage can later publicly appear in the ACM Digital Library. If your paper is accepted and you cannot comply with this requirement because of copyright or permission problems, your paper’s acceptance will be rescinded.  \n Supplemental Materials   \n Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as additional implementation details, ablations, comparisons, additional images or videos, related papers, derivations, or results, as well as code and data files (so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper). These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read the paper itself.  These materials must be anonymized  , so that they can be made available to all reviewers. There are two separate parts in the online submission form for uploading supplementary materials:  \n A) Anonymous supplemental materials that are considered part of the submission, and that you are committing to provide for the ACM Digital Library if your paper is accepted.  \n B) Anonymous materials that you are submitting to help in the review process but do not plan to submit to the ACM Digital Library.  \n For instance, in addition to videos, A) may include some code, and a .zip archive containing result images and some text files, such as detailed user-study results or other appendices associated to your submission. B) may include anonymized versions of related papers from the same authors currently under review or in press elsewhere, together with an anonymous cover letter that outlines the differences between the submission and these other papers. In case of resubmission with reviewer continuity, the cover letter explaining how you took into account previous reviews and listing the improvements in your method should be there, too.  \n Resubmissions   \n If your paper is a revision of a paper that has previously been submitted to a SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conference, we recommend (but do not require) that when you fill out the submission form you identify it as a resubmission, and select the option that allows the previous review materials (reviews, reviewer discussions, summaries, etc.) to be made available to the Technical Papers Committee. Please indicate the latest conference that your paper was submitted to and its paper ID at the time. If you choose to use this option, your paper may be assigned to some or all of the previous reviewers, and all reviewers will have access to suitably anonymized versions of the prior review materials. We encourage you to choose this option if you consider the paper to be derived from the previous version, even if the paper has been substantially rewritten and authors have been added. It will result in more consistent reviews and decrease the chance that a new set of reviewers will want completely different changes than those you made in response to the reviews of your earlier submissions. This option also has the added side benefit of reducing the overall burden on the volunteer reviewing community. Note that simply responding to all earlier criticisms will not guarantee acceptance. If you resubmit with reviewer continuity, you should include a cover letter within the anonymous supplementary materials, part B, in order to explain the changes you made to the paper and how you improved your work and its exposition since the last review cycle. If you resubmit without continuity, you may still choose to submit a similar anonymous cover letter to make it easier for recurring reviewers to understand the changes that have been made since the previous submission.  \n Permissions and Copyrights   \n You must have permission from the owner or copyright holder to use any images or video (or provide rationale for using them without permission) that you do not own in your submitted paper or supplementary material. ACM has a clear policy and procedures for handling Third-Party Material   . If your submission is accepted, you will be asked to provide a signed rights form, which is required by ACM before your paper can be published. The contact author of each paper will receive an email message from ACM Rights Review containing instructions and a link to the rights form, which is completed online.  \n Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. They also are required to upload final versions of all public supplementary materials (Part A) that were originally part of their submission.  \n If the contact author for an accepted paper is affiliated with an institution that is part of the ACM OPEN program, and their e-mail address is associated with that institution, their paper can be published Open Access without having to pay the APC. If you are the contact author for a paper and your institution is part of that program, make sure you are using your institution’s email address and not a personal email address for correspondence.  \n   \n Back to Top    \n\n Evaluation  \n     \n  The Technical Papers Committee and a set of external (i.e., tertiary) reviewers, both consisting of recognized experts, will review submitted papers. Then, at the committee meeting, the committee will select the papers to be presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in either a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics  or in the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.  \n The Technical Papers review process will be conducted by (1) the Technical Papers Chair, who was chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Chair and approved by the ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee and its Conference Advisory Group; (2) the Assistant Technical Papers Chair, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair; (3) the Technical Papers Advisory Board, consisting of past and future Technical Papers Chairs and other trusted and experienced advisors, chosen by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Chair; (4) the Technical Papers Committee, chosen by the Technical Papers Chair with the assistance of the members of the Technical Papers Advisory Board, and consisting of about 100 people whose expertise spans the entire field. Both Journal-only and dual-track submissions will be reviewed by the same Technical Papers Committee. The Technical Papers Chair will work with the Technical Papers Committee and the tertiary reviewers to evaluate each valid submission.  \n The Review Process   \n After the submission deadline, the Technical Papers Chair and several others selected by the Technical Papers Chair will conduct the paper sort. During this meeting, they assign each paper to two senior reviewers, called the primary and secondary reviewers, who are members of the Technical Papers Committee. All parties participating in the review process enter their conflict of interest data into the submission system ahead of time. The Technical Papers Chair does not make assignments or review papers. Rather, it is the job of the chair to facilitate the process. Papers that are inappropriate may be desk rejected during this assignment process without being sent to any senior reviewers. Papers rejected at this stage would include those that are clearly off topic for SIGGRAPH 2025, discovered to have been published previously or to have been submitted simultaneously to another conference or journal, breaking anonymity or format requirements in the submission, or clearly below the minimum quality standard of a SIGGRAPH paper. For more details, see | Submission Policy | and | Frequently Asked Questions | . \n  The two assigned senior reviewers may, upon conferring with each other and the Technical Papers Chair, recommend a paper to be rejected without additional review. A paper will normally be rejected at this stage only if it falls into one of the categories listed in phase one, but this fact was not detected during the paper sort. \n  Each paper is distributed to three or more additional experts, called tertiary reviewers. These reviewers are selected by the primary and the secondary reviewers. The identity of the authors is not revealed to any of the reviewers. The primary and the secondary reviewer are warned by the submission system, Linklings, if their selection of tertiary reviewers would result in a conflict of interest. For each reviewed paper, all tertiary reviewers and the secondary write full reviews, while the primary may write a meta-review. See the | Review Form | and | Reviewer Instructions | . Thus, at least four full reviews are written for each paper that has not been rejected during phases one and two. In unusual cases, such as when a tertiary reviewer fails to deliver a review on time, papers may receive less than four reviews. However, if a paper receives fewer than four reviews, additional reviewers will be found, possibly from the committee. For more details, see the | Review Process | section in the | Technical Papers FAQ | . \n  After all reviews are complete, the review system allows the authors access to the reviews and scores for their papers on | 10 March 2025 | . Then, authors have until | 17 March 2025, | 22:00 UTC/GMT, | to enter rebuttals if they feel the reviewers have made substantive errors or to answer specific questions posed by the reviewers. The rebuttal is confined to 1,000 words in length (plain text) and must be self-contained. For instance, URLs to additional material are not allowed. The rebuttal period is for addressing factual errors in the reviews, not for providing revised text or new results. Any such novel material will be ignored by the reviewers. For more details, see the | Rebuttal Process | section of the | Technical Papers FAQ | . \n  Between the end of the rebuttal period and the committee meeting, the senior reviewers will read all the submitted reviews (at least four), as well as the author rebuttals, confer intensively about the paper, and prepare a recommendation for the committee meeting. The three tertiary reviewers will see the author rebuttals and will participate in discussions about the paper. Due to the double-blind review process, the authors must maintain anonymity in their rebuttals. In addition, the tertiary reviewers do not know each other’s identities, so they too must maintain anonymity during the discussion. The preliminary recommendation agreed on at this stage will be either “conditionally accepted” or “rejected.” If an agreement on the recommendation cannot be reached, a third option is to “table” the paper for further review and discussion during the final Technical Papers Committee meeting. \n  If a paper is tabled, the senior reviewers will select one or more other members of the Technical Papers Committee to write extra reviews of the paper and be prepared to discuss it in detail at the meeting. The extra reviews will be written during the week before the committee meeting. If consensus still cannot be reached, it is even possible that additional extra reviews will be assigned during the meeting itself. Any extra paper reviews will be provided to the authors after the meeting. \n  The full Technical Papers Committee meets to finalize conditional acceptance or rejection of each paper. In cases where a consensus on a paper was not reached during the pre-meeting discussion phase, additional committee members may read the paper, and their evaluations will be taken into account in the decision. Submissions will either be accepted as a Journal Paper or a Conference Paper. \n  Members of the Technical Papers Committee, including the chairs, are not present when papers for which they have conflicts of interest are discussed. Papers are judged solely on their merit, as determined by the reviews. Although the acceptance rate of SIGGRAPH papers has remained stable in the range of ~20-30%, there is no quota for the number of papers that should be accepted by the SIGGRAPH 2025 Technical Papers Committee; this number will arise organically from the actions of the committee.  \n Possible Outcomes for a Paper   \n Email notifications of the Technical Papers Committee’s decisions will be sent following the committee meeting (see the Timeline  below). The notifications will place each paper in one of the following categories.  \n Conditionally accepted Journal Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published. \n  Conditionally accepted Conference Paper for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025. | The committee provides a list of required changes that must be performed to the paper for the work to be published, limited to changes that are satisfiable within the current page limits. \n  Rejected from SIGGRAPH 2025. | Submissions that were deemed not suitable for the conference, or too flawed or incomplete to be accepted, will be rejected. In some cases, the reviewers may find enough merit in the submission that they encourage the authors to consider resubmitting to either | ACM Transactions on Graphics | or a future SIGGRAPH conference, with reviewer continuity. The review summary includes a set of suggested changes. \n  Conditionally accepted papers undergo a second reviewing process, in which a member of the Technical Papers Committee verifies that the final version of the paper is acceptable, i.e., that any required changes have been made, and that other changes made by the authors have not compromised the paper in any way. This second and final stage determines the final acceptance status of all papers. The referees’ decisions are final. Papers that do not satisfy the referees in the second stage of reviewing and/or that are not uploaded in final form by the final deadline, together with the original or revised versions of the submitted supplementary material, will be rejected. One author of the paper, or an author’s designate in the unlikely event that none of the authors could attend the conference, must commit to presenting the paper in person at the SIGGRAPH 2025 conference in Vancouver, Canada.  \n   \n Back to Top    \n\n Upon Acceptance  \n     \n  Authors of papers conditionally accepted by the committee must revise their submission for the second round of reviewing and deliver that material to Linklings. Once the reviewers have approved the paper, authors will finalize the preparation of their camera-ready paper and deliver the source of that paper, and any supplemental materials, to TAPS for publication. Accepted Conference Papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and Journal Papers will be published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics.   \n TAPS is ACM’s article processing system, which accepts LaTeX or Word source documents and prepares the formatted PDF and HTML5 versions of one’s article for publication in the ACM Digital Library. The use of TAPS replaces the need for authors to prepare and deliver “camera-ready” materials to Linklings. Information on preparing and delivering materials to TAPS can be found here    . Conference Track papers go through TAPS, and Journal Track papers go through Linklings.   \n Notification of conditional acceptances and rejections will be sent to authors, along with any extra reviews and possibly a list of required changes (see Timeline  below). A member of the Technical Papers Committee, typically the primary reviewer, will be assigned as referee for the revision cycle.  \n A few days after notification, any changes to the paper title along with a 50-word description of your paper suitable for the web site will be submitted in the “Stage 3 Program Material” form. Note: changes to the paper title must be approved by your referee. For Journal Papers, changes to paper length must be approved by the referee, and extensions of more than one page are unlikely to be granted. Papers accepted to the conference program can be extended by one page in the camera-ready version only to accommodate the author list, author affiliations, and acknowledgements (no other content should be added, i.e., the anonymous version still must fulfill the paper length requirements discussed before). In addition, after the final version has been approved, the authors may integrate figures included in the two figures-only pages of the submission into the main text, resulting in a total of at most 10 pages plus references.  \n The deadlines for the revised version and final version of your paper are listed in the Timeline below. During the week between these two dates, the referees and authors will communicate via the bulletin board process about the adequacy of the changes in the revisions. Sometimes, changes are not initially considered adequate, or introduce new problems, so further revision may be required. It is recommended to submit the initial revised version sooner than the deadline in order to provide more time for iterated revisions. It is hoped that all conditionally accepted papers will be accepted by the end of this process, but this is not guaranteed. When writing successive revisions, the referee’s job is made easier if authors use a different color for the added or revised text in each new version. (Please remember to remove these colors in the final version.) It also helps to describe the changes in the bulletin board post to which the revision is attached.  \n ORCID Mandate   \n ACM requires that all accepted journal authors  register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  \n You and your co-authors can create and register your ORCIDs at https://orcid.org/register  . ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.  \n Papers Fast Forward Session   \n For each accepted paper, one author is required to participate in the Papers Fast Forward session on-site in Vancouver, Sunday, 10 August 2025. In addition to the material that is part of your publication, you will be asked to provide a short presentation for the Papers Fast Forward. The authors will be allowed 20 seconds to summarize the paper and entice attendees to attend their complete paper presentation during the conference week. The deadline for the Papers Fast Forward pre-recorded video is 30 June 2025. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance.  \n In-Person Presentation   \n For each accepted paper, one author is required to present in-person at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, 10-14 August 2025. Following the oral presentations, the author is expected to participate in an interactive discussion poster session where they will have the opportunity to interact with participants in a more intimate setting. Additional information will be provided upon acceptance including live streaming and recording details.  \n Presenter Recognition   \n Contributor Registration Benefit: One author per accepted Paper receive a 25% discount on Full Conference registration.  \n To present your Paper at SIGGRAPH 2025, authors must be registered at the Full Conference registration level.  \n You will receive an email by early June explaining how to access the registration discount code as well as instructions for registering. The author using the discount code is eligible for the early-bird registration rate regardless of when registration is completed. Any additional authors who will be presenting the paper are required to register at the appropriate registration level for the program, and prevailing registration rates will apply.  \n Authorization for Use   \n Any material that supports a paper’s acceptance for publication must be available as part of the final publication (see Submission Requirements)  . Thus, all material uploaded for review in the “public materials that are considered part of the submission” section of the submission form, including supplementary text, images, and videos, are subject to the ACM copyright policy, and the required permission forms must be completed upon acceptance. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the necessary permissions cannot be given for publication of material that is substantially similar to that submitted for review, acceptance of the paper may be withdrawn. Upon acceptance, authors must deliver final versions of their papers and their supplementary material, which will be made available to subscribers to the ACM Digital Library via the web page associated with their TOG papers.  \n Please be aware that ACM has updated its copyright policy to give authors the options of retaining copyrights on some materials or to pay fees that enable free access. You can read about the policy here     or a more concise summary here    . Authors of accepted Technical Papers are required to complete the ACM Rights Form prior to publication. For every supplemental file originally uploaded as part of your submission, you must upload either copies of the originally submitted material (now in non-anonymized form) or updated versions of this material to the online submission system’s final versions page (see the Timeline below for the deadline)  .  \n Technical Papers Preview Trailer   \n A Technical Papers Preview Trailer will be prepared from selected parts of the videos accompanying accepted papers. The preview will appear in the Electronic Theater at the conference and may also be used to publicize the Technical Papers program inside and outside the conference, like on the web. If a section of your video is selected, you will be asked to provide a high-quality rendering of that clip. Therefore, if you submit a video accompanying your paper, please keep your raw data available for that purpose.  \n ACM Rights Management Form   \n If your work is accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025, you must complete the ACM Rights Management Form. The form will be sent to all submitters whose work is accepted.  \n Your representative image and text may be used for promotional purposes. Several SIGGRAPH 2025 programs may prepare preview videos for pre-conference promotion of accepted content, which may include a portion of the video you submitted for review. You have the option to grant or deny us the ability to use the representative image and submitted video for these purposes.  \n   \n Back to Top    \n\n Timeline  \n     \n  All deadlines are 22:00 UTC/GMT unless otherwise noted  \n 16 January 2025   \n  Submission form deadline   \n  One of the authors must start a submission in the online submission system “Linklings” and provide basic information about the paper, including the complete list of authors and abstract. All authors must enter their complete and valid conflict of interest and research expertise data in Linklings by this deadline.  \n 23 January 2025   \n  Paper deadline   \n  Basic information about your submission such as contact details of the corresponding authors, paper title, paper length, are required. Additionally, the submitted paper in PDF format and a representative image must be uploaded, along with any video, code and data, and other supplemental material if applicable. Alternatively, MD5 checksums may be uploaded in lieu of any of the files involved in the submission.  \n 24 January 2025   \n  Upload deadline   \n  If MD5 checksums were submitted by the Paper deadline (as described above), files that match the checksums can be submitted until this deadline.  \n 10 March 2025   \n  Reviews available for authors & rebuttal begins  \n 17 March 2025   \n  Rebuttals due  \n 31 March 2025   \n  Decisions announced  \n 29 April 2025   \n  Revised paper submitted by authors for final review  \n 6 May 2025   \n  Final version deadline  \n 30 June 2025   \n  20-second pre-recorded Papers Fast Forward video deadline  \n 27 July 2025   \n  Official publication date for both the SIGGRAPH 2025 Conference Papers Proceedings and the Technical Papers TOG Issue (Volume 44, Issue No. 4 of ACM Transactions on Graphics  ).  \n Please Note:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  \n 10 August 2025   \n  Papers Fast Forward Session  \n 10-14 August 2025   \n  SIGGRAPH 2025  \n  Vancouver Convention Centre  \n  Vancouver, Canada  \n   \n Back to Top    \n\n Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  \n     \n  SIGGRAPH prioritizes conversations and industry contributions that spotlight how diversity, equity, and inclusion makes our communities, industries, and teams stronger. Conference programs provide a safe place to grow, discuss, and learn from one another and to bridge boundaries with the goal of making our community more inclusive and accessible to all.

The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with representatives from leading companies.  \n The Berlin Area.  Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is located in the heart of Europe. With 50 lakes, three rivers (Havel, Spree, and Dahme), and eight canals, Berlin is a water city with around 1,000 bridges, significantly more than Venice. The federal capital has about 3.9 million inhabitants and is Germany's number one cultural melting pot. People from all over the world have shaped the city. Nowhere else in Germany can you find so many world-famous sights, events, flair, charm, entertainment options, a vibrant nightlife, a vast shopping world, and boundless culinary diversity.  \n The Conference Hotel.  The conference will be held at the InterContinental Berlin, a modern and internationally renowned hotel, distinctive with its checkerboard façade and one of the most famous hotels in Berlin. The location directly at the famous \"Tiergarten\" and just a short walk from the iconic Brandenburg Gate makes the InterContinental Berlin an exclusive starting point for exploring the multicultural metropolis.

Abstracts and/or paper tiles such as “TBD”, “XXX”, “coming”, “abcabc” or similar will be desk rejected. There will be no deadline extensions to the dates listed above.  \n All authors of the paper must be declared at the time of paper submission. Changes to the authorship list can only be accepted by the program chairs only if substantial reasoning is provided that the list of authors should change.  \n Policy on Concurrent/Previous submissions  \n Papers whose contributions overlap with work currently under review elsewhere must not be submitted to ACM MobiSys 2025. Papers whose contributions overlap with an earlier published paper will be considered only if  \n the previous paper was published (not just accepted) at a workshop before the ACM MobiSys 2025 submission date and \n  it adds significant new contributions over the previous paper. Authors uncertain whether their submission meets these guidelines should contact the program chairs. Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. \n  All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy  not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved.  \n Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication. However, we encourage the authors to  \n Use different system names in the technical report and ACM MobiSys 2025 submission and \n  Avoid publicizing the technical report on social media or community blogs and webpages while it is under review by ACM MobiSys 2025. \n  Resubmission Policy [New to MobiSys'25]   \n If your submission was based on work that was previously peer-reviewed and rejected, you are encouraged to provide a short summary of the points raised by the reviewers of your previous submission and how you addressed them. This non-mandatory summary can be submitted to the submission system  and should not be part of the paper submission itself. We do not expect a full rebuttal addressing each point, but rather an indication to the reviewers of ACM MobiSys 2025 that you have taken the previous reviewers’ comments seriously and are not simply resubmitting the paper as it was to ACM MobiSys 2025. The summary you have provided will be visible to the reviewers after they submitted their review to avoid any bias against paper resubmissions.  \n Double-Blind Review Process  \n As in the case of previous ACM MobiSys editions, ACM MobiSys 2025 will use a double-blind review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only program committee chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.  \n Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. Papers may be conditionally accepted and shepherded by a member of the program committee, with final acceptance determined by consent of the shepherd.  \n Formatting Guidelines  \n Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (PDF). We will not accept papers in any other format. Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be rejected without review:  \n Contain no more than twelve (12) single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. \n  Font size no smaller than 10 points. \n  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. \n  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). \n  Again, submissions must be in PDF. Authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. \n  Authors’ names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. \n  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: please contact the Program Committee chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. \n  You may find these | templates | useful in complying with the above requirements. For LaTex users, please use | \\documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart} | . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify that your submission is format-compliant. \n  Ethics Review Board Approval Requirement  \n As part of the submission process, authors of papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze non-public data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), will be asked to certify that their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., Institutional Review Board (IRB), Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) or similar approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Papers that will not adhere to this rule will be rejected.  \n Mandatory Registration  \n At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the ACM MobiSys 2025 conference (at a non-student rate) and present the paper in-person.  \n Artifact Evaluation and Paper Results Reproducibility  \n As in the case of previous two ACM MobiSys editions, the authors of accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will have the option to opt for an artifact evaluation. By doing so, they commit to providing the implementations, models, test suites, benchmarks, and data used to derive the results presented in the paper to the artifact evaluation committee. Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badgelink: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging  . The artifact evaluation will be conducted after paper acceptance decisions.  \n Irrespective of taking part in the artifact evaluation, we encourage all authors to do their best to provide enough information in the paper allowing non-authors to replicate results presented in the paper.  \n Early Rejection Notification and Rebuttal  \n ACM MobiSys 2025 will have early rejection notifications and a rebuttal phase. The authors of the papers that do not advance to the second round of review will be notified of the rejection of their paper. This allows the authors to plan for another submission and not have to wait for the ACM MobiSys 2025 review process to come to an end. The papers that do advance to the second round of review will get a chance to submit a rebuttal after the second round comes to an end. In the rebuttal, the authors will be asked to respond to the questions raised by the reviewers.  \n We ask the authors to limit their responses to correcting factual errors in the reviews or responding to specific questions posed by the reviewers. Responses must not include new experiments or describe additional work completed since submission. To lower the amount of effort for both the authors and reviewers, ACM MobiSys 2025 limits the rebuttal to 500 words.  \n Conflict of Interest  \n To ensure a fair review process, PC members who have a conflict of interest with any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark conflict of interests in the submission website.  \n ACM MobiSys 2025 will follow the ACM policy  and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define conflicts of interest of one submission as:  \n any program committee member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; \n  any program committee member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; \n  any program committee member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months; \n  any program committee member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author; These include your BSc advisor(s), Msc advisor(s), PhD advisor(s) and/or postdoctoral host(s). \n  any program committee member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months; \n  any program committee member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations); \n  any program committee member who has family, marriage, blood or heritage relationships. \n  any program committee member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author; \n  others perceivable conflicts. \n  Cases that do not require conflict of interest notification include:  \n Reviewers that are working on the same topic as you. \n  Collaborations with the reviewers on program committees, open source projects, etc. \n  A potential conflict of interest must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  \n The author(s) must identify every conflict of interest out of all program committee members (including chairs) with any author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  \n Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated conflict of interest, and knowingly and falsely asserting a conflict of interest, e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another are both considered as a violation of this conflict of interest policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews. Please contact program committee chairs if you have any doubts regarding declaring conflicts of interest.  \n Pitch Video for Accepted Papers [New to MobiSys'25]   \n All accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will be asked to submit, together with a camera-ready version of their paper, a (approximately) 90 seconds video presenting their accepted project. The submitted video will be part of ACM MobiSys 2025 proceedings and added to the SIGMOBILE YouTube Channel.  \n Policy on the Use of Large Language Models [New to MobiSys'25]   \n Following other major conferences such as CHI 2025  , any text in submissions that is generated using large-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly identified by the authors in the submitted paper. This policy does not apply to using LLMs for editing/proof-reading the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship  before you use these tools. While we do not anticipate using tools at a large scale to identify LLM-generated text, we will thoroughly investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.  \n Contact and questions  \n Please contact the ACM MobiSys 2025 Program Co-Chairs:  \n Swarun Kumar, Carnegie Mellon University [ | swarun@cmu.edu | ] \n  Przemysław Pawełczak, TU Delft [ | p.pawelczak@tudelft.nl | ] \n    \n Sponsors  \n     Silver Sponsors  \n     \n © 2025 ACM | Header © Wikimedia"

It aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society. It develops new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications nowadays. Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy, among others. The PODS community is an open space where researchers from various areas related to the principles of computer science can discuss, interact, and propose solutions to problems in data management.  \n Scope  \n PODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application and system building in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or a rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts. At a time when computer science is increasingly data-centric, it is essential to promote an active exchange of tools and techniques between PODS and other communities focused on data management. PODS thus pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science.  \n Topics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:  \n Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing \n  Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints \n  Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions \n  Data quality: Data consistency, data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration \n  Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams \n  Uncertainty: Incomplete data, inconsistent data, probabilistic data \n  Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access \n  Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management \n  Human-database interaction: data summarization, data visualization, explanation for database queries \n  Connections between database principles and other disciplines \n  Submission Site  \n https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025   \n Submission Format  \n Important: The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications.   \n LaTex users must format their submission using the standard ACM \"acmsmall\" proceedings stylesheet:  \n https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template   \n They must use the following class declaration:  \n  \n \\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}   \n A submission can be up to 15 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time; online appendices are not allowed. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops.  \n Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the PACMMOD ( https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod  ) journal. Authors of papers published in the PACMMOD issues of PODS 2025 will be invited to present their work at the SIGMOD/PODS conference. PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process. This implies that submitted papers must adhere to the double-blind reviewing policy described below and, in addition, authors must provide a list of potential conflicts of interest at the moment of submission.  \n Double-anonymous reviewing  \n PODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. This means that submissions must adhere to the following:  \n Author names and institutions must be omitted. \n  References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person. \n  Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed. \n  However, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.  \n Merit-based acceptance  \n The paper selection will be merit-based. We have no a priori limit on the number of accepted papers. As such, paper selection is strongly based on the individual contribution of papers and less so on the number of papers ranked higher in the conference tool. The program committee will judge the work based on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth.  \n Important Dates  \n FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE:   \n Abstract: May 31, 2024  \n Submission: June 7, 2024  \n Rebuttal: July 29 - August 1, 2024  \n Initial notification: August 12, 2024  \n Revision submission: August 26, 2024  \n Final notification: September 2, 2024  \n  \n  SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE:   \n Abstract: December 2, 2024  \n Submission: December 9, 2024  \n Rebuttal: February 3-7, 2025  \n Initial notification: February 14, 2025  \n Revision submission: February 28, 2025  \n Final notification: March 7, 2025  \n  \n  All deadlines end at 5 PM Pacific Time."

Through the conference, participants will explore cutting edge ideas and results, and exchange techniques, tools and experiences.  \n Major Changes from Prior Years  \n Please make note of the following changes well before you submit your paper:  \n 1 Year Wait: | Rejected papers cannot be submitted to SIGMOD until a full year has passed. I.e. a paper rejected at Round 4 of SIGMOD 2024 can only be resubmitted to Round 4 of SIGMOD 2025. A paper rejected at Round 2 can be resubmited to Round 2, 3, and 4 of SIGMOD 2025. \n  ORCIDs: | ORCIDs are required for all authors at the time of abstract submission. See | Submission Guidelines | . \n  Abstract, COIs and Paper Submission Dates: | Abstracts and COIs are submitted a week ahead of the main paper submission on Jan 10, Apr 10, Jul 10 or Oct 10. See | Dates | . \n  No Special Tracks: | Previous data-intensive and data science applications tracks are now folded into the main research track, although they retain unique criteria. See | Topics | . \n  No Author Feedback Phase: | There will be no author feedback phase this year. See | Review Process | . \n  Shepherding in place of Revision Requirements: | Initial feedback from reviews will be an unambiguous Accept or Reject. Accepted papers may have revision requirements from the reviews; a shepherd will assist authors of accepted papers in meeting these requirements. See | Review Process | . \n  Posters and Random Selection for Presentation: | Every accepted paper will be allocated a poster presentation slot. However, due to ever-increasing numbers of accepted papers, there will not be a speaking slot for each accepted paper in 2025. Instead, speaking slots will be allocated via random sampling among accepted papers.

All papers are strongly encouraged to present a poster at these plenaries.  \n The number of SIGMOD submissions has been growing steadily over many years. To accommodate publication growth while maintaining an engaging and communal in-person conference, SIGMOD 2025 will randomly  select a subset of accepted papers for presentation at the conference. Authors of randomly selected papers will be invited to present their paper in a speaking slot at the conference.  \n A random sample of papers ensures a fair selection process, reflects the main themes of the pool of accepted papers, and maintains the principle that all papers regardless of presentation selection are of full SIGMOD quality.  \n REVIEW PROCESS  \n Each submission will receive three  reviews.  \n  In response to community feedback, there will be no  author feedback this year. Moreover, unlike past years, all papers will receive an initial Accept or Reject decision upon completion of reviews. In lieu of the revision requests from prior years, many accepted papers will be assigned a shepherd  to guide authors through revisions. Final acceptance is contingent upon satisfying shepherding requests.  \n   \n Timeline   \n These are rough timelines that are subject to change.  \n Submission to Notification is 6 weeks   \n  \n Week |  \n 0 | Abstract Bidding & Reviewer Assignment \n 1 | Submission and Review \n 2 | Review \n 3 | Review \n 4 | Discussion \n 5 | Discussion \n 6 | Discussion, Shepherd Selection (for all accepted papers; usually main champion) \n\n Notification to Final Submission is 9 weeks   \n  Rejected papers cannot be submitted to SIGMOD until a full year has passed.  \n\n Week |  \n 1 | Authors create and submit revision plan \n 2 | Shepherd reviews plan and submits feedback \n 3 | Shepherd reviews plan and submits feedback \n 4-8 | Authors revise and resubmit \n 9 | Shepherd, AE, Reviewers make final acceptance/rejection decision \n\n Common revision requests can include  \n justify a crucial assumption, \n  improve motivation of the potential benefits of the work, \n  clean up notation, tighten presentation, \n  compare against specific relevant prior work, \n  show experimental results with better data, such as at larger scale or with richer statistical properties. \n   \n Revision requests must be reasonably achievable in time for resubmission, and will not be requested to address lack of technical depth or novelty or where the revised paper will address a substantially different problem from the original.  \n One extra content page is allowed to accommodate the requested revision items. The revised submission should include a cover letter (up to 4 pages) to summarize how the authors have addressed the requested revisions.  \n In addition to the revised submission and cover letter, authors are encouraged to include a visual diff of the original and revised versions (e.g. via latexdiff or word processing tools that Track Changes).  \n SUBMISSION GUIDELINES  \n\n Submission Link | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2025 \n Submission Paper length | 12 pages excluding references \n Appendix | No Appendix \n Camera Ready Paper length | 13 pages excluding references, no appendix \n File type and size | PDF (<= 10 MB) \n Paper size | Letter (8.5” x 11”) \n Format | 2-column ACM Proceedings format: Latex: | sample-sigconf.tex (version 2e) \n  Word: | Interim layout.docx \n  Overleaf: | ACM’s official 2-column template \n Anonymity | Double-anonymity (see below) \n\n No changes to author lists are allowed after submission. \n  No changes to title are allowed after submission except by AE request. \n  Accepted papers will need to be ported to the PACMMOD format for final publication. Do not use PACMMOD format for submission or review. \n   \n Declaring Conflicts of Interest (COI)   \n   \n Each author | is responsible for entering their | ORCID | , own individual domain and PC conflicts on CMT. You can mark your conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting ''Domain Conflicts'' and ''Individual Conflicts''. We expect authors to have a single unique ORCID: the one used at submission will be used for publication. \n  An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions. \n  Conflicts are | not | declared per submission. \n  Conflict declaration must occur prior to paper submission. \n   \n It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members.  \n Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  \n Definition of Conflict of Interest   \n  A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of the following conditions holds:  \n The PC member is a co-author of the paper. \n  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past five years. | 1 \n  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past five years. | 2 \n  The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. \n  The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. \n  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. \n   \n 1  Short-term associations, such as summer internships do not constitute institutional COIs. E.g., a student who interned at Microsoft should declare as conflicts any individuals in the group they worked with and other collaborators on their projects, but they should not declare a domain conflict with microsoft.com.  \n 2  Collaborations are indicated by prior co-authorships, shared grant funding, and close research relationships, even if those have not yet resulted in common publications. Publications (typically with a large set of authors) that fall outside the traditional sense of research collaborations (e.g., “The Seattle Report on Database Research”, “ Diversity and Inclusion Activities in Database Conferences: A 2021 Report”, etc.) do not in themselves constitute a COI.  \n To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members may be asked to confirm declared conflicts with submitting authors.  \n Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirement   \n  Following the ACM guidelines  a research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 cannot be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for SIGMOD. Furthermore, after you submit a research paper to SIGMOD, you must await the response from SIGMOD and only re-submit elsewhere if your paper is rejected — or withdrawn at your request — from SIGMOD. This restriction applies not only to identical papers but also to papers with a substantial overlap in scientific content and results.  \n To enforce this requirement, the high-level metadata of submissions (title, abstract, list of authors), may be shared with the Program Chairs / Editors of other conferences and journals.  \n Every research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 must present substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. In this context, a prior publication is (a) a paper of five pages or more, presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If a SIGMOD 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication (respecting the double anonymity requirement), and clearly indicate which parts of the work appeared in prior publications and which parts are novel to the current submission.  \n Any violation of this policy will result in the immediate rejection of the submission, as well as in notification to the members of the SIGMOD Executive Committee, the members of the SIGMOD PC, and the editors or chairs of any other forums involved.   \n Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   \n  As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  \n Inclusion and Diversity in Writing   \n  We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and professions. Both are important in our writing as well. Diversity of representation in writing is a simple but visible avenue to celebrate and ultimately help improve our community's diversity. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Be vigilant and guard against unintentionally exclusionary examples.  \n Please visit this page for many examples of both exclusionary writing to avoid and inclusive writing that celebrates diversity to consider adopting: https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html  .  \n Authors are further encouraged to follow the tips and guidelines provided at: https://dbdni.github.io/#materials  .  \n Reviewers will be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise. Going further, also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in writing.  \n Please see https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter  for inclusive alternatives for some of the terms commonly used in the computing profession.  \n Policy on Authorship Requirements   \n  We follow the ACM policy on authorship requirements  . Specifically on the use of generative AI tools and technologies, the guidelines note that: \"Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.\"  \n Anonymity Requirements for all submissions   \n  Research track submissions are subject to the double-anonymity requirement.  \n Every research track paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 will undergo a double-anonymous reviewing process, following the three principles put forward in | (Snodgrass 2007) | : authors should not be required to go to great lengths to anonymize their submissions; comprehensiveness of the review trumps anonymizing efficacy. AEs retain flexibility and authority in managing the reviewing process. \n  PC members and referees, except the Associate Editors, who review the submission will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship from the PC members and referees, authors must at least do the following: Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the submission. \n  Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. \n  Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. \n  The paper’s file name must not identify the authors of the submission. \n  Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors' names in the submission's associated metadata. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file. \n   \n To avoid compromising the double-anonymity requirement, we request that the authors refrain from publicizing and uploading versions of their submitted manuscripts to pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, and other online forums during the reviewing period. If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to SIGMOD.  \n You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:  \n In our previous work [1, 2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, \"A Simple Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10. [2] Jane Smith, \"A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.   \n The solution is to reference one's past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity:  \n In previous work [1, 2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, \"A Simple Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10. [2] Jane Smith, \"A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.   \n Despite the anonymity requirements, you should still include all relevant work of your own in the references, using the above style; omitting them could potentially reveal your identity by negation. However, self-references should be limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced.  \n Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. The goal is to preserve anonymity while still allowing the reader to fully grasp the context (related past work, including your own) of the submitted paper. In past years, this goal has been achieved successfully by thousands of papers.  \n It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.  \n No exceptions will be made to the double anonymity requirement for Research Track papers. If the authors of a submission feel that double anonymity needs to be violated, for example to reveal the identity of a system, they may consider submission to a SIGMOD track that does not impose a double anonymity requirement, such as the Industry Track.  \n Artifacts and Reproducibility   \n  SIGMOD strives to establish a culture where sharing research artifacts (data, results, code, and scripts) is the norm rather than an exception. SIGMOD reproducibility has three goals: (a) Highlighting the impact of database research papers; (b) enabling easy dissemination of research results; and (c) enabling easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In this context, we expect all papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available if this is possible. Although it is not mandatory for acceptance, providing this extra material can help reviewers evaluate your work more thoroughly. Papers published at SIGMOD which have been successfully reproduced are also recognized and highlighted as such in the ACM Digital Library.  \n Please include a link with your materials in the text box provided in the submission form at the time of submission. For all Research Track submissions, the link and materials should preserve anonymity. For example this may be an anonymous GitHub repository. You may want to make sure that the link you provide is not indexed by search engines. On GitHub, you can do so by adding the following to the page head:  \n <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">   \n We recognize that at the time of submission authors focus on fine-tuning the paper, and so we expect this link to be live within one week from submission. Reviewers that may need to look at the materials will not do so earlier than that. We do not expect a fully polished submission in terms of automatically reproducing results, but rather a reasonably clean version of the state of the code when submitting the paper. Please, do not use a shortened link which traces who accesses it.  \n In the event that you are not able to submit your code, data, scripts, and notebooks please explain in the text box provided in the submission form why this is the case."

For papers in the work-in-progress category, add the suffix “(WIP)” to your title, such as “Title (WIP)”.   \n To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules:  \n author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, \n  references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). \n  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.  \n ACM Publications Policies   \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. \n  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start, and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. \n  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE   \n The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n By submitting the paper, the authors agree that if the paper is accepted, one author will have to register at the conference rate and present the paper in person at the LCTES 2024 conference.   \n Submission site   \n https://lctes24.hotcrp.com   \n\n Speaker's Guide  \n   \n LCTES’24 Speaker’s Guide   \n This document is for those presenting a paper at LCTES’24. If you’re presenting at ISMM, PLDI, or a PLDI tutorial or workshop, please see the Speaker’s Guide on the page for the corresponding conference/track.  \n Congratulations on having your paper accepted at LCTES’24! This document will help ensure your presentation runs smoothly and has the best possible audience impact. Please read it in its entirety.  \n Checklist   \n Before LCTES:  \n Prepare and practice. \n  Each presentation slot lasts for | 15 minutes, including 12 minutes of presentation and 3 minutes of Q&A | . \n  Upload a backup copy of your talk slides (details below). \n  Check the program to establish when and where your talk will be. \n  Ensure you have a | HDMI adaptor | for your device. \n  Before your talk:  \n Familiarize yourself with the room you will be speaking in. \n  Find and introduce yourself to your session chair. \n  Ensure that you are in the room | no later than 5 minutes | before your session. \n  After your talk:  \n Expect questions from the floor and session chair. \n  Preparing Your Talk   \n Your work will have a greater impact if you’re well prepared.  \n It is very important that you run to schedule. The LCTES’24 schedule is extremely tight, with hard stops imposed by FCRC scheduling. Session chairs have been asked to stick rigidly to the schedule.  \n Guidelines   \n Your talk should run for no more than 12 minutes, uninterrupted. This gives you about three minutes for questions and speaker change-over. \n  Your talk should be prepared for the standard | 16:9 widescreen ratio | . If your talk is in a different ratio, at best it will be | pillarboxed | , wasting screen real estate and diminishing impact, and at worst, it won’t display correctly. \n  You will present your talk from a lectern, using a fixed lectern mic. \n  You will need to provide your talk ahead of time in either pdf or powerpoint. \n  Uploading Your Presentation   \n As an insurance against technical failures, we ask all speakers to make a backup copy of their presentation available to the video team by uploading it the day before the session. You’re welcome to upload fresh copies at any time.  \n Format: your presentation must be saved as a | powerpoint or pdf | file (sorry!) \n  Naming: you must use your paper ID as your file name ( | .[ppt,pptx,pdf], e.g., LCTES-paper43.pptx) \n  Location: please use this link: | https://www.dropbox.com/request/xp2Z2934nxRH0LQXm8RC \n  This requirement gives you assurance that if some major technical problem were to arise (such as a failure of your laptop), you will still be able to give your talk. If you do not make your presentation available in advance, and significant technical problems arise, we may have to shorten your presentation to keep to our tight schedule.  \n The requirement for you to use pdf or powerpoint for your backup copy is a pragmatic tradeoff. These slides will only be used in case of a technical emergency. We want to have the highest possible assurance that they will work without fuss on a third party device should such an emergency occur. If you use Google slides, Keynote, or some other software, please use the export feature to create either powerpoint or pdf backups.  \n If you elect not to upload a backup copy, please understand that this limits our volunteers’ capacity to assist you if a technical problem arises when you give your presentation.  \n Advice   \n There are many excellent sources of advice on giving good talks, including from Simon Peyton Jones  , Michael Hicks  , Michael Ernst  , and Derek Dreyer  . Make good use of these!  \n Q&A   \n If you stick to the above schedule you will have about 3 minutes for questions. The in-room audience will be able to ask questions via a queue at a single microphone on a mic stand in the center of the room.  \n It is good practice, as the speaker, to repeat your understanding of the question before providing your answer. This is particularly important when time is tight because it reduces opportunities for time being wasted on account of a misunderstanding.  \n   \n Call for Papers  \n   \n Call for Papers   \n Programming languages, compilers, and tools are important interfaces between embedded systems and emerging applications in the real world. Embedded systems are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, large language models, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore, they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these issues, such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints.  \n The 25th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2024) solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted to https://lctes24.hotcrp.com/  .  \n Important Dates   \n Abstract submission - | February 16, 2024 | February 22, 2024 (AoE time) \n  Paper submission - | February 23, 2024 | February 29, 2024 (AoE time) \n  Paper notification - April 1, 2024 \n  Camera-ready paper submission - May 1, 2024 \n  Conference - June 24, 2024 \n  Paper Categories   \n Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work (at most 2 additional pages for references and appendix). \n  Poster, work-in-progress and invited paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions. \n  Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, this year’s LCTES will have | Distinguished Paper awards | selected from this year’s accepted paper to recognise the outstanding work among all papers. \n  Special Issue Invitation   \n Accepted full papers will be invited to submit to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS)   . A TECS publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process. Papers submitted to LCTES (including the WIP papers) will be welcome to submit manuscripts to a special issue of the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (IEEE ESL)   . A 4-page IEEE ESL manuscript will require clearly distinct intellectual contribution as compared to the conference paper and will undergo a separate review process.  \n Topics   \n Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest including, but not limited to:  \n Programming language challenges   \n Domain-specific languages \n  Features to exploit multicore, reconfigurable, and other emerging architectures \n  Features for distributed, adaptive, and real-time control embedded systems \n  Capabilities for specification, composition, and construction of embedded systems \n  Language features and techniques to enhance reliability, verifiability, and security \n  Virtual machines, concurrency, inter-processor synchronization, and memory management \n  Compiler challenges \n  Interaction between embedded architectures, operating systems, and compilers   \n Interpreters, binary translation, just-in-time compilation, and split compilation \n  Support for enhanced programmer productivity \n  Support for enhanced debugging, profiling, and exception/interrupt handling \n  Optimization for low power/energy, code/data size, and real-time performance \n  Parameterized and structural compiler design space exploration and auto-tuning \n  Tools for analysis, specification, design, and implementation, including: \n  Hardware, system software, application software, and their interfaces \n  Distributed real-time control, media players, and reconfigurable architectures \n  System integration and testing \n  Performance estimation, monitoring, and tuning \n  Run-time system support for embedded systems \n  Design space exploration tools \n  Support for system security and system-level reliability \n  Approaches for cross-layer system optimization \n  Theory and foundations of embedded systems \n  Predictability of resource behavior: energy, space, time   \n Validation and verification, in particular of concurrent and distributed systems \n  Formal foundations of model-based design as the basis for code generation, analysis, and verification \n  Mathematical foundations for embedded systems \n  Models of computations for embedded applications \n  Novel embedded architectures \n  Design and implementation of novel architectures   \n Workload analysis and performance evaluation \n  Architecture support for new language features, virtualization, compiler techniques, debugging tools \n  Architectural features to improve power/energy, code/data size, and predictability \n  Mobile systems and IoT \n  Operating systems for mobile and IoT devices   \n Compiler and software tools for mobile and IoT systems \n  Energy management for mobile and IoT devices \n  Memory and IO techniques for mobile and IoT devices \n  Large language models (LLMs) and programming languages/compilers   \n Impact of LLMs on embedded system design and architectures \n  LLM-based debugging tools for embedded software \n  Adapting LLMs for resource-constraint environment \n  LLM for embedded systems and compilers \n  LLM for program analysis, testing and verification. \n  Program analysis, testing and verification for LLM \n\n Important Dates   AoE (UTC-12h)     \n\n Mon 24 Jun 2024  \n  Conference Date \n Wed 1 May 2024  \n  Camera-Ready Deadline \n Mon 1 Apr 2024  \n  Paper notification \n Thu 29 Feb 2024  \n  Paper submission \n Thu 22 Feb 2024  \n  Abstract submission \n\n Submission Link   \n   \n   https://lctes24.hotcrp.com     \n   \n Organizing Committee    \n   \n Aviral Shrivastava General Chair    \n Arizona State University   \n United States \n  Yulei Sui Program Chair    \n UNSW Sydney   \n Australia \n  Guangdong Bai Publications Chair    \n University of Queensland   \n Australia \n  Yuekang Li Publicity Co-Chair    \n The University of New South Wales   \n Australia \n  Hye-Young Paik Publicity Co-Chair    \n The University of New South Wales \n  Xiao Cheng Web Chair    \n UNSW   \n Australia \n    \n Program Committee    \n   \n Aaron Smith Programme Committee    \n Microsoft   \n United States \n  Bin Ren Programme Committee    \n College of William & Mary   \n United States \n  Chandra Krintz Programme Committee    \n Univ. of California, Santa Barbara \n  David B.

The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.  \n Scope   \n In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:  \n Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimization. \n  Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. \n  More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2024 include, but are not limited to:  \n Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. \n  Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. \n  Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. \n  Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. \n  This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the program co-chairs, Guillaume Allais ( guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk  ) and Annie Liu ( liu@cs.stonybrook.edu  ).  \n AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n Supporters   \n\n Call for Papers  \n  \n Three kinds of submissions will be accepted:  \n Regular Research Papers  should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages. \n  Short Papers  may include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages. \n  Talk Proposals  may propose lectures about topics of interest for PEPM, existing work representing relevant contributions, or promising contributions that are not mature enough to be proposed as papers of the other categories. Talk Proposals must not exceed 2 pages. \n  References and appendices are not included in page limits. Appendices may not necessarily be read by reviewers. Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at:  \n http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/   \n and submitted electronically via HotCRP: https://pepm25.hotcrp.com   \n Reviewing will be single-blind.  \n Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs).  \n Accepted regular research papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted short papers do not constitute formal publications and will not appear in the proceedings.  \n At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop (physically or virtually) to present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected.  \n\n Invited Speakers  \n\n William Bowman  – University of British Columbia   \n   \n Brigitte Pientka  – McGill University   \n   \n Satnam Singh  – Groq   \n\n Abstracts   \n\n The Ethical Compiler: Addressing the Is-Ought Gap in Compilation    \n   William Bowman    \n The is-ought gap is a problem in moral philosophy observing that ethical judgments (“ought”) cannot be grounded purely in truth judgments (“is”): that an ought  cannot be derived from an is  . This gap renders the following argument invalid: “It is  true that type safe languages prevent bugs and that bugs cause harm, therefore you ought  to write in type safe languages.”. To validate ethical claims, we must bridge the gap between is and ought with some ethical axiom, such as “I believe one ought  not cause harm.”.  \n But what do ethics have to do with manipulating programs? A lot! Ethics are central to correctness! For example, suppose an algorithm infers the type of e  is Bool  , and e  is in fact a Bool  ; the program type checks. Is the program correct—does it behave as it ought  ? We cannot answer this without some ethical axioms: what does the programmer believe ought  to be?  \n I believe one ought to design and implement languages ethically. We must give the programmer the ability to express their ethics—their values and beliefs about a program—in addition to its mere computational content, and build tools that respect the distinction between is and ought. This talk is a guide to ethical language design and implementation possibilities.  \n Bio    \n William J. Bowman is an Assistant Professor of computer science in the Software Practices Lab at University of British Columbia. Broadly speaking, he is interested in making it easier for programmers to communicate their intent to machines, and preserving that intent through compilation. More specifically, their research interests include secure and verified compilation, dependently typed programming, verification, meta-programming, and interoperability. His recent work examines type-preserving compilation of dependently typed programming languages like Coq, a technique that can enable preserving security and correctness invariants of verified software through compilation and statically enforcing those invariants in the low-level (assembly-like) code generated by compilers.  \n\n Cocon: A Type-Theoretic Framework for Meta-Programming    \n   Brigitte Pientka    \n Meta-programming is the art of writing programs that produce or manipulate other programs. This allows programmers to automate error-prone or repetitive tasks, and exploit domain- specific knowledge to customize the generated code. Hence, meta-programming is widely used in a range of technologies: from cryptographic message authentication in secure network protocols to support reflection in proof environments such as Lean.  \n Unfortunately, writing safe meta-programs remains very challenging and sometimes frustrating, as traditionally errors in the generated code are only detected when running it, but not at the time when code is generated. To make it easier to write and maintain meta-programs, tools that allow us to detect errors during code generation - instead of when running the generated code - are essential.  \n This talk revisits Cocon, a framework for certified meta-programming. Cocon is a Martin-Löf dependent type theory for defining logics and proofs that allows us to represent domain-specific languages (DSL) within the logical framework LF and in addition write recursive programs and proofs about those DSLs using pattern matching. It is a two-level type theory where Martin-Löf type theory sits on top of the logical framework LF and supports a recursor over (contextual) LF objects. As a consequence, we can embed into LF STLC or System F, etc. and then write programs about those encodings using Cocon itself.  \n This means Cocon can serve as a target for compiling meta-programming systems -from compiling meta-programming with STLC to System F. Moreover, Cocon supports writing an evaluator for each of these sub-languages. This also allows us to reflect back our encoded sub-language and evaluate their encodings using Cocon’s evaluation strategy.  \n I will conclude with highlighting more recent research directions and challenges that build on the core ideas of Cocon and aim to support meta-programming and intensional code analysis directly in System F and Martin-Löf type theory.  \n Bio    \n Brigitte Pientka a Full Professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill University. Her main research interests lie in developing theoretical foundations of programming languages. A central question of her work is: How can we design programming languages that ensure that programs are safe and have fewer bugs? In 2018, her work on the Beluga programming language has received the Test of Time Award from International Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming (PPDP).  \n Brigitte Pientka is a leader within the programming languages research community, and serves for example on the SIGPLAN executive committee. In particular, she is passionate about working towards overcoming systemic barriers for underrepresented groups. In 2018, she co-founded the Women in Logic workshop which provides valuable networking opportunity to female researchers and as the general chair for POPL in 2020 she introduced Mentoring Breakfasts which now are a fixture at SIGPLAN events.  \n\n The Missing Diagonal: High Level Languages for Low Level Systems    \n   Satnam Singh    \n The computing community has produced many high level languages and tools for programming high level systems (e.g. Java for user interfaces) and it has produced many low level languages and tools for programming low level systems (C for operating systems, Verilog for hardware design) yet there are not many examples of high level systems that have been produced to help develop low level systems. Sometimes this is due to a suspicion that the layers of abstraction that high level systems use incur unacceptable performance overheads. However, this talk attempts to challenge that view, giving examples of high level systems that improve the designer productivity for developing low level systems which also improve the quality of verification for low level systems.  \n The talk will draw examples from the presenter’s own experience, as well as the work of others. Specific examples will include Lava and Bluespec for the design of hardware, the Silver Oak project for the co-design of a high assurance silicon root of trust, a Haskell-based DSL for programming machine learning chips, and recent work on the specification and verification of parts of a new silicon chip produced at Groq which makes use of the same Haskell DSL.  \n Bio    \n Satnam Singh is a Fellow at Groq where he applies the power of functional programming languages to the design of machine learning chips and their programming models. Satnam Singh previously worked at Google (machine learning chips, cluster management), Facebook (Android optimization), Microsoft (parallel and concurrent programming) and Xilinx (Lava DSL for hardware design). He started his career as an academic at the University of Glasgow (FPGA-based application acceleration and functional programming).  \n\n Questions?

PODS started in 1982. It is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD). Since 1991, PODS has been held jointly with the SIGMOD conference, combining the full spectrum of database research, from the most abstract and fundamental to the most pragmatic. A single registration gives attendees access to both PODS and SIGMOD sessions and copies of both proceedings.  \n PODS papers are distinguished by a rigorous approach to widely diverse problems in databases, often bringing to bear techniques from such fields as computational logic, finite model theory, complexity theory, algorithm and data structure design and analysis, and many others. In addition to approximately 25 research papers selected from a large number of submissions, the conference includes invited tutorials and keynote talks.  \n General Info  \n SIGMOD/PODS 2025 | ( | PODS Call for Papers | ) \n  Who are we? | The PODS Hall of Fame. \n  PODS Organization | Here you find the history of PODS organization and all the Program Committees. \n  ACM PODS Alberto O.

The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties. Scope In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular: Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimisation. Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications. More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2024 include, but are not limited to: Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation. Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation. Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation. Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security. This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme co-chairs, Guillaume Allais (guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk) and Annie Liu (liu@cs.stonybrook.edu).

We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases. In keeping with SOSP tradition, we will favor work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with or measurements of state-of-the-art implementations.  \n\n Submission Criteria  \n   \n Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:  \n Motivate a significant problem; \n  Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution; \n  Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution; \n  Draw appropriate conclusions; \n  Clearly describe the paper's contributions; and \n  Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work. \n  We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.  \n\n Originality  \n   \n Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed.  \n Submissions that extend the authors' previous work are welcome, but authors must explain the differences between the SOSP submission and the prior work, much in the same way that the authors are expected to articulate the contributions of their submission as they relate to prior work by others. Self-comparisons should be properly anonymized, as described below.  \n Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in SOSP. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. As long as there is significant additional content in the submission compared to the prior workshop publication, the PC will evaluate the submission's entire contribution, not just the delta.  \n Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is explicitly permitted.  \n\n Resubmissions  \n   \n Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted, although authors are expected to have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews. Authors should provide information regarding the previous submission(s) and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This description, which will be supplied to reviewers after they’ve completed their reviews, helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit the description of changes to one page. All information should be properly anonymized, as described below, and should be uploaded via the submission form.  \n\n Anonymity  \n   \n SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names. If the name of your project or system is already known to the community (e.g., through arXiv, technical reports, talks, social media posts, or other uses), your SOSP submission must use an anonymized name.  \n Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say \"Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Lee et al. [Lee17]\".  \n For concurrent submissions on related topics, cite an anonymized version of the concurrent submission and discuss the relation between the submissions. Additionally, please email the PC chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ) a copy of your other concurrent submission.  \n If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution or organization, you should refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties of the system that are needed to appreciate the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests, etc.). We recognize that, in some cases, these properties may allow a reviewer to identify your institution or organization.  \n Check with the program chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ) if you are uncertain about the anonymity rules.  \n\n Supplementary Material  \n   \n Authors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document. Supplementary material is intended for items that are not critical for evaluating the paper but may be of interest to some readers. Examples include: formal proofs that are only sketched in the submission, additional analyses, and methodological details that aren’t essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. PC members are not required to read this optional supplementary material, so the submission must stand alone without it.  \n\n Formatting  \n   \n Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format via the web submission form  .  \n Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by 8 mm (0.33 in) of whitespace. Use 10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on 12-point (single-spaced) leading. Graphs and figures should be readable without magnification; they are encouraged to be in color, but should remain readable if printed in grayscale. All pages should be numbered, and references within the paper should be hyperlinked.  \n Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations. We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules.  \n Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN LaTeX  or MS Word templates  from the ACM.  \n For Latex, we recommend you use:  \n \\documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart} \\renewcommand\\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{} ... \\settopmatter{printfolios=true} \\maketitle \\pagestyle{plain} ...   \n\n Confidentiality  \n   \n Reviewing will be done mostly by members of the program committee, with limited use of outside reviewers. Submissions will be treated as confidential; however, papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered for publication.  \n\n Conflicts  \n   \n To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:  \n Institutional:  You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (since April 2022), or are going to begin employment at the same institution. Former interns should list their internship supervisor(s) and collaborator(s) as conflicts, not the entire institution where they interned.  \n Advisor:  You have a past or present association as PhD thesis advisor or advisee.  \n Collaborator:  You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (April 2022 or later).  \n Personal:  You are close family relatives (e.g., spouses, domestic partners, parents, children, or siblings).  \n The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts may be removed (e.g., do not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having the individual review your paper). If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs ( sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  ).  \n PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the \"conflict chair\". Any paper with a PC chair co-author will be held to a higher standard of being a “clear accept”.  \n\n Author Response Period  \n   \n SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow. As PC members are not required to review supplementary materials, responses must not rely on the existence of those materials.  \n Submission of a response is optional. There is no explicit limit to the response, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep responses under 500 words; reviewers are neither required nor expected to read excessively long responses.  \n\n Accepted Papers  \n   \n Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to supply electronic versions of their papers and encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process. To facilitate broad technical discussion, all accepted papers will be made available online in advance of the conference. The official publication date will be the date the proceedings are made publicly accessible. For more information about the ACM OpenSurround Service, please go to https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/free-access  . Papers of particular merit will be forwarded to the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) and the Communications of the ACM's Research Highlights (CACM RH) for possible publication.  \n\n Submission Information  \n   \n Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the web submission form  .  \n\n Questions  \n   \n Any questions about paper submissions can be emailed to sosp24-pc-chairs@cs.wisc.edu  .  \n\n  In cooperation with  \n     \n Additional Information  \n Prior SOSPs \n    \n Contact Us  \n Any organizational questions about the conference can be emailed to sosp24chairs@cs.utexas.edu  .

Depending on the system to be studied and the objective of the simulation study different methods are used for modeling, executing the model, and for analyzing results and steering the experiment. Our group, as part of the Institute for Visual and Analytic Computing  (VAC), focuses on the development of methods for modeling and simulation. Of particular interest in our research are:  \n Discrete event formalism/languages particularly for multi-level and spatial modeling \n  Parallel, distributed, and sequential simulation algorithms \n  Flexible and reusable approaches for modeling, executing a model, and entire simulation studies \n  Reliability of simulation results \n  Intelligent support for simulation studies \n  Performance evaluation of simulation techniques \n  Our work involves methodological approaches as well as the development and implementation of concrete tools. The work is propelled by and addresses challenges entailed by different application domains of M&S, such as computer science, demography, cell biology, and ecology.  \n\n News  \n   \n 08.07.2022     \n ACM SIGSIM PADS Ph.D. Colloquium Award 2022 received   \n  \n Till Köster received the ACM SIGSIM PADS Ph.

The SIGCSE Technical Symposium addresses problems common among educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate computing programs, curricula, and courses. The symposium provides a forum for sharing new ideas for syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of instruction. The symposium provides a diverse selection of technical sessions and opportunities for learning and interaction.  \n SIGCSE TS 2025 will be held from February 26 - March 01, 2025, at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. SIGCSE TS 2025 will be primarily an in-person conference, though there will be limited online participation options.  \n Hybrid Options for 2025   \n SIGCSE TS 2025 will continue to be a hybrid event. Some aspects of the conference will be only available to in-person attendees. However, online participants will be able to participate in:  \n Keynotes \n  A selection of panels and special sessions \n  A selection of live online paper presentations \n  A selection of online tutorials \n  Nifty Assignments \n  The legendary SIGCSE Coffee Break Show \n  The online conference communication platform \n  Our hope is that this will give everyone an opportunity to present their research at the 2025 SIGCSE Technical Symposium, even if they are unable to travel, and that it will provide an affordable option to enjoy some of the symposium’s content for those that can’t attend in person. The remaining aspects of SIGCSE TS 2025—including BoFs, Demos, Lightning Talks, Posters, and the ACM Student Research Competition—will be offered only in person.   \n Authors of accepted submissions will be required to present their work in-person at the conference  , except for a limited number of papers and tutorials that are scheduled to be virtual.  \n Submission Information   \n We will be using EasyChair  for SIGCSE TS 2025.  \n We are not requiring ACM TAPS  for SIGCSE TS 2025.  \n We will be using the ACM two-column format for papers, posters, panels, special sessions, lightning talks, demos, and the ACM SRC. Tutorials and Birds-of-a-feather submissions will now use forms rather than PDFs. Nifty will continue to expect a zipped folder.  \n Submission Link  : https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigcsets2025   \n Reviewing Information   \n To volunteer to review for SIGCSE TS 2025, please visit https://tinyurl.com/review-sigcse25  . If you are not sure whether or not you have already volunteered to review, please send email to program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .  \n New for 2025   \n SIGCSE-Style Workshops are now called Tutorials  : We are now referring to these three-hour interactive sessions as “Tutorials”. The submission and review process will otherwise be the same as they were last year. (Explanation: We’ve heard some confusion between SIGCSE-Style Workshops and “Workshops” that are intended to be a collection of papers.)  \n New/clarified AI Policies  : Please visit the Policies on Generative AI, LLMs, and Related Tools  menu item under the Info menu for more details.  \n Clarifications on Paper Tracks  : We’ve set up a new menu item, Choosing a Track  , to provide information on which paper track might be most appropriate. Also feel free to reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .  \n Earlier Deadlines  : Unfortunately, with SIGCSE TS occurring about three weeks earlier this year than last year, as well as the ever-increasing number of submissions, we have had to move the paper deadlines to mid/late July.  \n Important Deadlines   \n  \n Round One | Papers, Panels, Special Sessions, Tutorials \n Abstract Due Date (Papers Only) | Sunday, 14 July 2024 \n Abstract Due Time (Papers Only) | 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) \n Round One Due Date | Sunday, 21 July 2024 \n Round One Due Time | 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) \n Round One Notification to Authors | Monday, 30 September 2024 tentative \n Round One final submissions due | Sunday, 17 November 2024 \n Round Two | ACM Student Research Competition, Affiliated Events, BoFs, Demos, Lightning Talks, Nifty Assignments, Posters \n Round Two Due Date | Monday, 14 October 2024 \n Round Two Due Time | 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) \n Round Two Notification to Authors | Monday, 18 November 2024 tentative \n Round Two Final Submissions Due | Sunday 8 December 2024 \n\n Supporters  \n   \n Platinum  \n\n   Gold  \n\n   Bronze  \n\n   Are you interested in supporting the SIGCSE Technical Symposium, or being an exhibitor?

The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with representatives from leading companies.  \n The Berlin Area.  Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is located in the heart of Europe. With 50 lakes, three rivers (Havel, Spree, and Dahme), and eight canals, Berlin is a water city with around 1,000 bridges, significantly more than Venice. The federal capital has about 3.9 million inhabitants and is Germany's number one cultural melting pot. People from all over the world have shaped the city. Nowhere else in Germany can you find so many world-famous sights, events, flair, charm, entertainment options, a vibrant nightlife, a vast shopping world, and boundless culinary diversity.  \n The Conference Hotel.  The conference will be held at the InterContinental Berlin, a modern and internationally renowned hotel, distinctive with its checkerboard façade and one of the most famous hotels in Berlin. The location directly at the famous \"Tiergarten\" and just a short walk from the iconic Brandenburg Gate makes the InterContinental Berlin an exclusive starting point for exploring the multicultural metropolis. It is one of Germany's leading conference and event venues, providing an outstanding stage for events of all kinds. It was honored with the \"Europe's Leading Conference Hotel\" award at the World Travel Awards 2024.  \n\n  SIGMOD/PODS 2025 Anti-Harassment Policy  \n SIGMOD 2025 adheres to the ACM Policy Against Harassment.  Any participant who experiences unacceptable behavior may contact any current member of the SIGMOD Executive Committee  and the PODS Executive Committee  or DBCares  . Please be assured that if you approach us, your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.  \n\n Credits   \n  Follow our progress:"

Organizing a SIG is a great way to start or extend your involvement in the CHI conference program. Several SIGs have evolved into other successful contribution types at subsequent conferences. In addition to interesting, timely and novel SIG topics, we also encourage creative approaches to conducting the SIG itself. While the SIG should provide a structure for discussion, successful SIGs have used exciting approaches to promote lively debate. For instance, previous years formats for the SIG session included a designathon, a reflection exercise, and a sketching group.   \n If you have any doubts regarding SIGs, we welcome you to contact us before submitting your proposal to discuss your ideas for innovative and attractive SIGs!   \n   \n ACM’s Publication Policies   \n It is critical that authors review ACM’s publications policies. Please read this separate page  for them.  \n   \n What is a Special Interest Group?   \n Special Interest Groups (SIGs) enable conference attendees sharing a common interest to meet informally for 75 minutes of facilitated discussion during a scheduled session at the conference. SIGs offer excellent opportunities for dialog and deliberation on a specific topic. The conference provides each SIG with meeting space and advertises SIG meetings to the rest of the conference in the Extended Abstracts and Conference Program.   \n   \n Should I Consider the Workshops, Courses, Special Interest Group, or Panel track?   \n Special Interest Groups enable attendees with a common interest to meet for informal but facilitated discussions during the main conference program. Workshops are meetings of subject matter experts exploring new knowledge. Courses are delivered by expert instructors, typically with established reputations, teaching people who are new to a topic. Panels are interactive, discussion-oriented forums in which audience members are participants in the discussion. See  Courses vs. Workshops vs. SIGs   for more information.   \n   \n Preparing and Submitting Your Special Interest Groups Proposal   \n SIG submissions must be submitted via the  PCS Submission System   . The submission must have the following components:   \n SIG Proposal: A 5-page description of the SIG (excluding references), suitable for publication in the | ACM Master Article Submission Templates | (single column). \n  Supplementary Material (also mandatory) using the same template and up to 2-pages. | A brief description of the community (or communities) to which this SIG would be of interest and why it is of interest. \n  Assumed attendee background. \n  The approach you will use for organizing and presenting the SIG. \n  An informal schedule of discussion topics. \n  Your plan to attract a reasonable number of attendees. \n  Which organizer should serve as the primary contact. \n  While not strictly required, we prefer that proposals be authored by a minimum of two individuals representing at least two different organizations. We also encourage prospective SIG organizers to examine examples of accepted SIG abstracts from recent CHI conferences, which are listed below:   \n CHI 2023: Human-Centered Responsible Artificial Intelligence: Current & Future Trends | https://doi.org/10.1145/3544549.3583178 \n  CHI 2023: Games and Play SIG: Connecting Through Social and Playful Technologies | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544549.3583176 \n  CHI 2023: Reflecting on Hybrid Events: Learning from a Year of Hybrid Experiences | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544549.3583181 \n  CHI 2021: Queer in HCI: Strengthening the Community of LGBTQIA+ Researchers and Research | https://doi.org/10.1145/3411763.3450403 \n  CHI 2021: Creative Immersive AI: Emerging Challenges and Opportunities for Creative Applications of AI in Immersive Media | https://doi.org/10.1145/3411763.3450399 \n  CHI 2021: Physiological I/O | https://doi.org/10.1145/3411763.3450407 \n  Authors are strongly encouraged to work on improving the accessibility of their submissions, using recommendations found in the  Guide to an Accessible Submission   . If you have any questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs at  accessibility@chi2025.acm.org  .   \n   \n Metadata Integrity   \n All submission metadata, including required fields in PCS like author names, affiliations, and order, must be complete and correct by the submission deadline. This information is crucial to the integrity of the review process and  author representation   . The submission deadline is a hard deadline for listing all  author names  ; there are  no exceptions  . Changes to the order of authors are allowed only during the Publication-Ready submission phase. Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the Publication-Ready submission phase.   \n   \n Policy on Use of Large Language Models   \n Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for  purposes beyond editing the author’s own text.  Please carefully review the April 2023  ACM Policy on Authorship   before you use these tools. The  SIGCHI blog post   describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and  desk reject  papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.   \n   \n Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   \n Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regards to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on  research involving humans   before submitting.   \n   \n Accessibility   \n Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. Authors are expected to follow  SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission   . If you have any questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs at  accessibility@chi2025.acm.org  early in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests).   \n   \n Selection Process   \n Submissions are  Reviewed   ; although the process is highly selective, it does not necessarily follow a reviewing process by a committee, and authors should not expect to receive formal feedback on their submission other than the selection decision.   \n We consider the following criteria, in descending order of priority:   \n Appeal to the community: | Is the topic both timely and of wide enough appeal to attract a significant audience? At the same time, is the topic sufficiently focused to allow for productive discussion during the SIG meeting? Too narrow, and the SIG might attract too few people; too broad, and it is difficult for progress to be made in the relatively short duration of a SIG. \n  Format: | Is the proposed format conducive to discussion and shared insight? Will it be possible to achieve its aims? SIGs are not workshops, nor project showcases, nor tutorials. \n  Diversity of perspective: | It helps to be able to show that the SIG will be able to encompass a wide perspective, and that the organizers can accommodate and facilitate discussion across this breadth. Places to show this are in the description of the intended community, the assumed attendee background, and the home institutions and disciplines of the organizers. \n  Continuity: | Does the SIG support the development of a longer term interest group, for example follow-on SIGs or other types of contributions at subsequent CHI and other conferences, or a SIGCHI Community? If the topic is a very recent or new one, or a revival of an old topic, then arguments will need to be made, to demonstrate that it is a topic that will persist, rather than simply being this year’s fashion. If the topic is a continuation of previous SIG(s), then it is necessary to present the latest developments of the topic and their projection into the future. \n  Submissions should not contain sensitive, private, or proprietary information that cannot be disclosed at publication time. Submissions should NOT be anonymous. However, confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until the start of the conference, with the exception of title and author information which will be published on the website prior to the conference.   \n   \n Upon Acceptance of Your Submission   \n The corresponding author of a conditionally accepted paper has to follow the  instructions   (link tba) on preparing and submitting a final version by the Publication-Ready Deadline. If the authors cannot meet these requirements by the Publication-Ready deadline, the venue chairs will be notified and may be required to remove the paper from the program. The publication-ready version has to follow the LaTeX and Word templates from ACM.

All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.  \n Paper Tracks   \n Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines  . Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not  be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  \n Computing Education Research  . The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results. \n  Experience Reports and Tools  . The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity. \n  Position and Curricula Initiative  . The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community. \n  Papers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list  at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.  \n Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  \n ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.  \n Presentation Modality   \n Papers at SIGCSE TS 2025 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a limited number of synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning: due to additional costs, there will be a limited number of rooms set up with cameras and the necessary zoom session licenses. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required.  \n   \n Dates    \n\n  This program is tentative and subject to change.  \n   Program Display Configuration  \n   \n   Time Zone   \n   \n The program is currently displayed in (GMT-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)  .

The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair  no later than Sunday, 14 July 2024. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.  \n The second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Sunday, 21 July 2024. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.  \n Important Dates   \n  \n Abstact Due Date | Sunday, 14 July 2024 \n Abstract Due Time | 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) \n Due Date | Sunday, 21 July 2024 \n Due Time | 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) \n Submission Limits | 6 pages + 1 page only for references \n Notification to Authors | Monday 30 September 2024 tentative \n Submission Link | https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigcsets2025 \n Session Duration | 15 minutes \n\n Instructions for Authors  \n   \n Authors should carefully choose the appropriate track  and review the authorship policies  . Authors may also find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers  and the Review Forms  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  \n Abstracts \n  Submission Templates \n  Double Anonymized Review \n  ACM Policies \n  ORCID IDs \n  Abstracts   \n All papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.  \n Submission Templates   \n SIGCSE TS 2025 is NOT  participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.  \n All paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).  \n Here is a Sample Paper Submission with Notes  that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  \n Page Limits:  Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.  \n MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  \n LaTeX Authors:   \n Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . \n  Please do not use the | anonymous | document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them. \n  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.) \n  NOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. | SIGCSE TS 2025 does not  permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7. \n  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract  , keywords  , CCS Concepts   , placeholders for the ACM Reference Format  and copyright blocks  , and references  . For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu  ). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers  . Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.  \n Other requirements:  Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.  \n Desk Rejects:  Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  \n Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   \n Double Anonymized Review   \n Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  \n Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  \n As per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.  \n Submissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  \n The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.  \n The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  \n ACM Policies   \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. Please see the Authorship Policies page  for details.  \n ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)  \n   \n Choosing a Track  \n   \n Be aware of reviewing guidelines for each track   \n Once submitted, a paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.  If your paper does not fit with the reviewing criteria below for the track that you chose, it is probable that it will receive lower scores.  \n Authors should check the following review guidelines to see in which track their paper best fits.  \n There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  \n All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted.  \n The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  \n  \n Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) \n Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. \n  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. \n  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. \n  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. \n  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience \n  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. \n  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. \n Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate \n  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated \n  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate \n  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate \n  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated \n Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. \n  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. \n  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? \n  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? \n  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). \n  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. \n  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. \n Evidence  Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims. | The analysis & results are clearly presented and aligned with the research questions/goals. \n  Qualitative or quantitative data is interpreted appropriately. \n  Missing or noisy data is addressed. \n  Claims are well supported by the data presented. \n  The | threats to validity | and/or study limitations are clearly stated | The submission provides rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why \n  Evidence presented in ERT papers is often descriptive or narrative in format, and may or may not be driven by explicit motivating questions. \n  Claims about the experience or tool are sufficiently scoped within the bounds of the evidence presented. | PCI papers need not present original data collection, but may leverage other forms of scholarly evidence to support the claims made. \n  Evidence presented is sufficient for defending the position or curriculum initiative \n  Claims should be sufficiently scoped relative to the type of evidence presented. \n Contribution & Impact  Evaluate the overall contribution to computing education made by this submission. | All CER papers should advance our knowledge of computing education \n  Quantitative research should discuss generalizability or transferability of findings beyond the original context. \n  Qualitative research should add deeper understanding about a specific context or problem \n  For novel projects, the contribution beyond prior work is explained \n  For replications, the contribution includes a discussion on the implications of the new results– | even if null or negativ | e–when compared to prior work | Why the submission is of interest to SIGCSE community is clearly explained \n  The work enables adoption by other practitioners \n  The work highlights the novelty of the experience or tool presented \n  The implications for future work/use are clearly stated | The work presents a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices \n  The submission offers new insights about broader concerns to the computing education community or offers guidance for adoption of new curricular approaches. \n Presentation  Evaluate the writing quality with respect to expectations for publication, allowing for only minor revisions prior to final submission. | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear \n  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear \n  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear \n  Overall flow and organization are appropriate \n  \n Example papers   \n There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from a prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as best papers  , which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  \n Here are the best papers from SIGCSE TS 2023 as examples that showcase the difference between the three paper tracks.  \n Computing Education Research (CER)   \n Geoffrey L.

Once you have accepted your invitation, you should update your profile, select topics you are most qualified to review, and identify conflicts of interest.  \n Selecting topics  : Select SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My topics  from the menu and select at about five topics you are most qualified to review. Please select no more than seven topics; more topics make it harder for the EasyChair system to make a good set of matches.  \n Conflicts of interest  : Reviewers also identify their Conflicts of Interest  by selecting SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My Conflicts  .  \n Reviewing in EasyChair   \n To review a paper.  \n Select “PC member (Paper - Experience Reports and Tools)” in the SIGCSE TS 2025 area  \n Log in to EasyChair. \n  In the EasyChair menu, select “My Recent Roles” \n  Select your PC member role in the SIGCSE TS 2025 area \n  Select | Reviews > Assigned to Me \n  Click on the Adobe PDF icon that corresponds to the paper. Doing so will give you access to the paper. \n  Make sure you’ve looked over | the review criteria | . \n  Click on the “Information” link (the I in a blue circle) associated with the paper. \n  Click on “Add Review” in the upper-right-hand corner \n  Enter your answers in a text editor or word processor. (EasyChair times out.) \n  Copy your answers over to EasyChair. \n  To update your review.  \n Select | Reviews > Assigned to Me \n  Click on the appropriate link in the “Update Review” column. \n  You might also want to click on “Show Reviews”, where you can see other reviews and comments, update your review, and add a comment.  \n Roles in the Review Process   \n Reviewers | write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria. \n  Associate Program Chairs (APCs) | write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs. \n  Program Chairs | make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chairs (for other tracks). \n  SIGCSE TS has three Program Chairs, each of whom serves a two-year term. Nominations for Program Chairs are solicited by the SIGCSE TS steering committee, which makes recommendations to the SIGCSE Board. Program Chairs are appointed by the SIGCSE board.  \n The Program Chairs invite and appoint the Reviewers and APCs. The number of submissions per Reviewer/APC depends on the number of volunteers and the size of the submissions pool.  \n The goals is for each paper submission to receive at least three reviews and a meta-review. All reviews are submitted through the submission system. In EasyChair, Reviewers are considered “Ordinary PC members” and APCs are considered “Senior PC members”.  \n Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)   \n There are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS  : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). Reviewers are assigned to a specific paper track (e.g. a reviewer in the CER track will only be assigned to review papers in that track). This is to avoid confusion and for reviewers to get familiar with the guidelines for their specific paper track.  \n All papers will be considered relative to criteria for motivation, use of prior/related work, approach, evidence, contribution/impact, and presentation. Each track has guidance about how reviewers should consider these criteria relative to the goal of the track, and each paper must be evaluated using the criteria for the track to which it is submitted. A paper will not be moved between the three paper tracks.   \n The following table illustrates how to interpret the review criteria for each of the three tracks of papers. Please refer to this table to help better understand the emphases or characteristics of the track for which you will be reviewing. For convenience, you may also download a PDF copy of the paper review criteria  .  \n  \n Criteria | Computing Education Research (CER) | Experience Reports & Tools (ERT) | Position & Curricula Initiative (PCI) \n Motivation  Evaluate the submissions clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. \n  The submission states a set of clear | Research Questions or Specific Aims/Goals. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. \n  Objectives or goals | of the experience report are clearly stated, with an emphasis on contextual factors that help readers interpret the work. \n  ERT submissions | need not | be framed around a set of research questions or theoretical frameworks. | The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. \n  Objectives or goals | of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues | beyond a single course or experience \n  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. \n  PCI papers | may or may not | ground the work in theory or research questions. \n Prior and Related Work  Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results. | Discussion of prior and related work (e.g., theories, recent empirical findings, curricular trends) to contextualize and motivate the research is adequate \n  The relationship between prior work and the current study is clearly stated \n  The work | leverages theory where appropriate | . | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the experience report is adequate \n  The relationship between prior work and the experience or tool is clearly stated | Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate \n  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated \n Approach  Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals. | Study methods and data collection processes are transparent and clearly described. \n  The methodology described is a valid/sound way to answer the research questions posed or address the aims of the study identified by the authors. \n  The submission provides enough detail to support replication of the methods. | For tool focused papers: Is the design of the tool appropriate for its stated goals? Is the context of its deployment clearly described? \n  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? \n  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? | The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). \n  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. \n  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. \n Evidence  Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims. | The analysis & results are clearly presented and aligned with the research questions/goals. \n  Qualitative or quantitative data is interpreted appropriately. \n  Missing or noisy data is addressed. \n  Claims are well supported by the data presented. \n  The | threats to validity | and/or study limitations are clearly stated | The submission provides rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why \n  Evidence presented in ERT papers is often descriptive or narrative in format, and may or may not be driven by explicit motivating questions. \n  Claims about the experience or tool are sufficiently scoped within the bounds of the evidence presented. | PCI papers need not present original data collection, but may leverage other forms of scholarly evidence to support the claims made. \n  Evidence presented is sufficient for defending the position or curriculum initiative \n  Claims should be sufficiently scoped relative to the type of evidence presented. \n Contribution & Impact  Evaluate the overall contribution to computing education made by this submission. | All CER papers should advance our knowledge of computing education \n  Quantitative research should discuss generalizability or transferability of findings beyond the original context. \n  Qualitative research should add deeper understanding about a specific context or problem \n  For novel projects, the contribution beyond prior work is explained \n  For replications, the contribution includes a discussion on the implications of the new results– | even if null or negativ | e–when compared to prior work | Why the submission is of interest to SIGCSE community is clearly explained \n  The work enables adoption by other practitioners \n  The work highlights the novelty of the experience or tool presented \n  The implications for future work/use are clearly stated | The work presents a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices \n  The submission offers new insights about broader concerns to the computing education community or offers guidance for adoption of new curricular approaches. \n Presentation  Evaluate the writing quality with respect to expectations for publication, allowing for only minor revisions prior to final submission. | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear \n  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear \n  Overall flow and organization are appropriate | The presentation (writing, graphs, or diagrams) is clear \n  Overall flow and organization are appropriate \n  \n Review Process Steps   \n Step 1: Authors submit Abstracts of Papers   \n Authors submit a title and abstract one week prior to the full paper deadline. Authors are allowed to revise their title, abstract, and other information before the full paper submission deadline.  \n Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Bid for Papers   \n Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize papers.  \n Reviewers and APCs are then asked to select a set of papers for which they have sufficient expertise (we call this “bidding”). The Program Chairs assign papers based on these bids. The purpose of bidding is NOT to express interest in papers you want to read  . It is to express your expertise and eligibility for fairly evaluating the work. These are subtly but importantly different purposes. We ask reviewers and APCs to select more papers than they plan to review so that we can best ensure that every paper has at least three reviewers.  \n Make sure to specify all of your | Conflicts of Interest | . \n  Bid on all of the papers you believe you have sufficient expertise to review. \n  Do NOT bid on papers about topics, techniques, or methods that you oppose. \n  Step 3: Authors submit Full Papers   \n Submissions of the full papers are due one week after the abstracts are due. As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Program Chairs.  \n Step 4: Program Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   \n The Program Chairs will quickly review each paper submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, length restrictions, or plagiarism policies. Authors of desk-rejected papers will be notified immediately. The Program Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Program Chairs will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Program Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected papers, leaving the decision to the other Program Chairs.  \n Step 5: Program Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   \n Based on the bids and their judgment, the Program Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC (meta-reviewer) for each paper submission. The Program Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm, which depends on all bids being high quality. For the reviewer assignments to be fair and good, the reviewer bids should only be based on expertise and eligibility. Interest alone is not sufficient for bidding to review a paper. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Program Chair without a conflict of interest.  \n Step 6a: Reviewers Review Papers   \n Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   \n Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text  . (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  \n Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, meta-reviewers, and Program Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the papers for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  \n Step 6b: APCs and Program Chairs Monitor Review Progress   \n APCs and Program Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, reminders are emailed to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  \n Step 7: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   \n The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  \n During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Program Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  \n Read all the reviews of all papers assigned (and re-read your own reviews). \n  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. \n  Use the | Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT and PCI) | to guide your discussions. \n  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. \n  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. \n  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. \n  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the paper \n  At the end of the discussion period, the APCs should have enough feedback so that they can make a recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. This recommendation should be based on their own reading of the reviews and discussion, not simply on the overall score.  \n Step 8: APCs Write Meta-Reviews   \n Toward the end of the discussion period, APCs use the reviews, the discussion, and their own evaluation of the submission to write a meta-review and a recommendation for the Program Chairs. A meta-review should summarize the key strengths and weaknesses of the submission, in light of the Paper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)  and explain how these led to their recommendation decision. APCs are encouraged to also include their review/feedback in the meta-review. The summary and explanation should help the authors in revising their work where appropriate. The meta-review must constructively summarize all reviews and the discussion as well as summarize any open questions and doubts. A generic meta-review (“After long discussion, the reviewers decided that the paper is not up to standards, and therefore rejected the paper”) is not sufficient.  \n APCs do not include their recommendation for acceptance or rejection  of a paper in their meta-review because they only see a small portion of the submitted papers. Instead, the APCs are asked to make a recommendation of accept or reject to the Program Chairs via the submission system. If however, the Reviewers had differing views and a consensus could not be reached, then the APC captures the essence of all reviews and leaves their recommendation as neutral, and the submission is then further discussed by the Program Chairs.  \n Recommendations should NOT be based only on scores. For example, an APC may decide to recommend rejection for a paper with three weak accepts, but recommend acceptance for a paper with two accepts and one strong reject (or vice versa)  \n Step 9: Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   \n Before announcing decisions, the Program Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews and meta-reviews to ensure clarity and consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. This is done via synchronous meetings of the Program Chairs. APCs are consulted if needed. The Chairs make decisions based on recommendations and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program.  \n The Program Chairs then notify all authors of the decisions about their papers via the submission system.  \n Step 10: Evaluation   \n The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  \n The Program Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  \n We will do our best to identify a small set of exceptional reviewers who will receive reviewing awards at the symposium.  \n Conflicts of Interest   \n SIGCSE TS takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, quite seriously. The conference adheres to the ACM conflict of interest policy ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest  ) as well as the SIGCSE conflict of interest policy ( https://sigcse.org/policies/COI.html  ). These state that a paper submitted to the SIGCSE TS is a conflict of interest for an individual if at least one of the following is true:  \n The individual is a co-author of the paper \n  A student of the individual is a co-author of the paper \n  The individual identifies the paper as a conflict of interest, i.e., that the individual does not believe that they can provide an impartial evaluation of the paper. \n  The following policies apply to conference organizers:  \n The Program Chairs are not allowed to submit to any track. \n  The chairs of any track are not allowed to submit to that specific track. \n  All other conference organizers are allowed to submit to any track. \n  All reviewers (PC members) and meta-reviewers (APC members) are allowed to submit to any track. \n  No reviewer, meta-reviewer, or chair with a conflict of interest in the paper will be included in any evaluation, discussion, or decision about the paper. It is the responsibility of the reviewers, meta-reviewers, and chairs to declare their conflicts of interest throughout the process. The corresponding actions are outlined below for each relevant step of the reviewing process. It is the responsibility of the chairs to ensure that no reviewer or meta-reviewer is assigned a role in the review process for any paper for which they have a conflict of interest.  \n Recalcitrant Reviewers   \n Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  \n   \n Reviewer FAQ  \n   \n These are some of the more common questions (and categories of questions) the Program Chairs have received. Please look over these questions in advance of reviewing. If you have a question not covered here (or even if you have a question about the questions covered here), please reach out to the program chairs at program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  .   \n Anonymity   \n General principle: We expect authors to make a good-faith effort to make their papers anonymous. We will not reject papers because it is possible with some sleuthing to discover their authors. If you do discover the authors’ identities, do your best to ignore them.   \n I was looking up aspects of this paper on the Web and found a copy of the paper on ArXiV (or other online archive) with the authors’ names listed. Does this break anonymity?  No. ACM Policy indicates that authors may submit works under review to online archives.  I see the name “Trovato” in the header of the document. Is this the name of one of the authors, thereby breaking anonymity?  No. “Trovato” is one of the default names in the ACM LaTeX template. You can feel free to ignore the name.  The name of the institution is mentioned in the text of the paper. Does this break anonymity?  Yes. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.  The name of the project is mentioned in the text of the paper. When I searched for the project on the Web so that I could better understand it, I discovered who the authors were.  Ideally, the authors should have anonymized the name of the project. Do your best to review the paper as if you did not know the authors and include a confidential comment in your review indicating this issue.   Human Subject Protection   \n General principle: We expect members of our community to follow high standards for the protection of human subjects. In particular, All authors submitting to SIGCSE TS are responsible for adhering to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .   \n However, different countries and different institutions have different policies or interpretations of policies. For example, US policies recently changed to exempt normal classroom activities as long as they do not affect student learning. Different institutions have interpreted that exemption in multiple ways and have different processes for obtaining that exemption.   \n In general, reviewers should assume that authors are telling the truth when they indicate that a study is exempt from review by the local IRB/ethics board. Nonetheless, if a reviewer has any concern about human subjects protection in a study, they should reach out to their APC and the Program Chairs.    \n The paper includes a study of students but indicates that “the work does not directly involve human participants”. Is that okay?  A study that involves students might be exempt from review, but it does  involve human participants. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  The authors note that the project is exempt from review, but I have trouble believing that. It certainly wouldn’t be at my institution.  Policies vary between countries and their interpretation varies between institutions. Nonetheless, if you are worried, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.  I am concerned that this study could cause harm to the participants.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Plagiarism, including self plagiarism   \n I am concerned that this paper is too close to another paper I have seen (or am reviewing).  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can explore the issue.Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. Note that authors can (confidentially) tell the Program Chairs about potential overlaps between papers and it is the Program Chairs’ responsibility to determine whether such overlaps are acceptable.  The running header for this paper appears to be for an earlier iteration of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. I am concerned that this work may be recycled.  Authors are certainly permitted to update and resubmit papers that were not accepted. Authors have also been known to reuse prior submissions as a template. In some such cases, they neglect to update the header. We find that these are the most common reasons we see headers that indicate a prior conference. However, if you are concerned that the content is recycled from an accepted paper, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Generative AI   \n Projects involving generative AI   \n The authors built a system using data that they did not generate. They do not seem to have obtained permission to do so. What should I do?  SIGCSE TS requires that authors obtain permission to use other people’s data and to explicitly indicate this in the acknowledgements section. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Authors’ use of generative AI   \n I believe that the authors used ChatGPT, Google Translate, or other tool in writing this paper. However, they have not acknowledged this use.  ACM policy permits authors to use generative AI tools but requires that they acknowledge the use of such tools. Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs so that we can clarify this issue. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable. You may also indicate your concerns in the review, but please clarify that your concerns did not affect your overall rating (unless the tools led to poor writing).  I am worried that some of the references are fake, perhaps generated by a tool.  Please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs ASAP. Then review the paper as if the work is acceptable.   Reviewers’ use of generative AI   \n Please refer to the general AI policies for some background.   \n May I use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tool to write my reviews?  No. It is a violation of ACM policies to feed the authors’ text into an online tool.  Can I use the Google “Help Me Write” tool, Microsoft writing tools, Grammarly, or other similar software?  Yes.  I’m worried that some text in this paper plagiarizes text from elsewhere. May I use TurnItIn or similar software to check?  No. If you have such concerns, please reach out to your APC and the Program Chairs.   Track choice   \n This paper was submitted to XXX but I think it belongs in YYY.  We do not switch papers between tracks. Please review the paper according to the criteria of the track the authors selected. You may certainly raise your concern about choice of track during the discussion and you can also include a comment in the confidential notes to the Program Chairs.   Concerns about other reviewers   \n I think another reviewer’s comments are overly harsh.  Please mention that during the discussion. (Please be polite in doing so.) If the other reviewer does not respond, reach out to the APC.  I think another reviewer’s reviews were generated by ChatGPT or other tool.  Please reach out to your APC or the Program Chairs. Do not accuse another reviewer directly.  I am concerned that another reviewer’s comments are inappropriate.  If you are comfortable doing so, please mention that during the discussion. If not, please reach out to the APC or the Program Chairs, who can then raise the issue with the other reviewer.     \n Review Forms  \n   \n The approximate text from the review form follows.   \n Note that not all reviewer responses are available to authors.   \n Common Introductory Fields   \n Summary  : Please provide a brief summary of the submission, its audience, and its main point(s), with respect to the review criteria of this track.

Is the context of its deployment clearly described? \n  For experience report papers: Is the experience sufficiently described to understand how it was designed/executed and who the target learner populations were? \n  For all papers: To what extent does the paper provide reasonable mechanisms of formative assessment about the experience or tool? \n  Evidence (ERT)  : Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims.  \n The submission provides rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. \n  Evidence presented in ERT papers is often descriptive or narrative in format, and may or may not be driven by explicit motivating questions. \n  ERT papers may include small-scale studies, but they need not be statistically significant. \n  Claims about the experience or tool are sufficiently scoped within the bounds of the evidence presented. \n  Contribution & Impact (ERT)  : Evaluate the overall contribution to computing education made by this submission.  \n Why the submission is of interest to SIGCSE community is clearly explained. \n  The work enables adoption by other practitioners. \n  The work highlights the novelty of the experience or tool presented. \n  The implications for future work/use are clearly stated. \n  Presentation (ERT)  : Evaluate the writing quality with respect to expectations for publication, allowing for only minor revisions prior to final submission.  \n The presentation (e.g., writing, grammar, graphs, diagrams) is clear. \n  Overall flow and organization are appropriate. \n  Position Papers and Curricular Initiatives   \n Motivation (PCI)  : Evaluate the submission’s clarity of purpose and alignment with the scope of the SIGCSE TS.  \n The submission provides a clear motivation for the work. \n  Objectives or goals of the position or curricula initiative are clearly stated, and speak to issues beyond a single course or experience. \n  Submissions focused on curricula, programs, or degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken. \n  PCI papers may or may not ground the work in theory or research questions. \n  Prior and Related Work (PCI)  : Evaluate the use of prior literature to situate the work, highlight its novelty, and interpret its results.  \n Discussion of prior and related work to contextualize and motivate the position or initiative is adequate. \n  The relationship between prior work and the proposed initiative or position is clearly stated. \n  Approach (PCI)  : Evaluate the transparency and soundness of the approach used in the submission relative to its goals.  \n The submission uses an appropriate mechanism to present and defend its stated position or curriculum proposal (this may include things like a scoping review, secondary data analysis, program evaluation, among others). \n  As necessary, the approach used is clearly described. \n  PCI papers leveraging a literature-driven argument need not necessarily use a systematic review format, though it may be appropriate for certain types of claims. \n  Evidence (PCI)  : Evaluate the extent to which the submission provides adequate evidence to support its claims.  \n PCI papers need not present original data collection, but may leverage other forms of scholarly evidence to support the claims made. \n  Evidence presented is sufficient for defending the position or curriculum initiative. \n  Claims should be sufficiently scoped relative to the type of evidence presented. \n  Contribution & Impact (PCI)  Evaluate the overall contribution to computing education made by this submission.  \n The work presents a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. \n  The submission offers new insights about broader concerns to the computing education community or offers guidance for adoption of new curricular approaches. \n  Presentation (PCI)  : Evaluate the writing quality with respect to expectations for publication, allowing for only minor revisions prior to final submission.  \n The presentation (e.g., writing, grammar, graphs, diagrams) is clear. \n  Overall flow and organization are appropriate. \n  Common Text: Recommendation   \n Overall evaluation  : Please provide a detailed justification that includes constructive feedback that summarizes the strengths & weaknesses of the submission and clarifies your scores. Both the score and the review text are required, but remember that the authors will not see the overall recommendation score (only your review text). You should NOT directly include your preference for acceptance or rejection in your review.  \n   \n Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  \n   \n Presentation Details   \n In-person presentations   \n TLDR: Each talk is in a session containing four talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop). New for 2025  : Your talk should be 15 minutes  with 5 minutes for questions.  \n Presentation Room & Technology  \n All presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.  \n You must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.  \n Due to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Pittsburgh will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.  \n Presentation Session  \n New for 2025  : There will be four  paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.  \n Speakers’ Lounge  \n In-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room.  \n Online presentation modality   \n There are limited slots for presenting a paper online. Requests for presenting over Zoom will be only considered during a short time after paper acceptance. If you indicate you will present in person or do not request an online presentation, then one author must present at the conference venue.  \n The authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (in rooms in the venue) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).  \n The Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.  \n Format of Online Presentation Sessions:  \n There will be four paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 20-minute block, which is a presentation of 15-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.  \n Session Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:  \n There will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.  \n The Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 20-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.  \n Session Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.  \n   Presentation Modality: Due TDB   \n Authors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.  \n Presentation modality selection is required by TDB. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to in-person presentation modality and will not be assigned to an online session.   \n Registration:   \n In order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.  \n Camera-Ready: Due 17 November 2024   \n Authors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.  \n Authors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: TBD \n  We also remind authors to | review the accessibility tips | to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties. \n  Optional Video Presentations   \n Authors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.  \n\n Submission Link   \n   \n   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigcsets2025     \n   \n Program Chairs    \n   \n Samuel A.

Through the conference, participants will explore cutting edge ideas and results, and exchange techniques, tools and experiences.  \n Major Changes from Prior Years  \n Please make note of the following changes well before you submit your paper:  \n 1 Year Wait: | Rejected papers cannot be submitted to SIGMOD until a full year has passed. I.e. a paper rejected at Round 4 of SIGMOD 2024 can only be resubmitted to Round 4 of SIGMOD 2025. A paper rejected at Round 2 can be resubmited to Round 2, 3, and 4 of SIGMOD 2025. \n  ORCIDs: | ORCIDs are required for all authors at the time of abstract submission. See | Submission Guidelines | . \n  Abstract, COIs and Paper Submission Dates: | Abstracts and COIs are submitted a week ahead of the main paper submission on Jan 10, Apr 10, Jul 10 or Oct 10. See | Dates | . \n  No Special Tracks: | Previous data-intensive and data science applications tracks are now folded into the main research track, although they retain unique criteria. See | Topics | . \n  No Author Feedback Phase: | There will be no author feedback phase this year. See | Review Process | . \n  Shepherding in place of Revision Requirements: | Initial feedback from reviews will be an unambiguous Accept or Reject. Accepted papers may have revision requirements from the reviews; a shepherd will assist authors of accepted papers in meeting these requirements. See | Review Process | . \n  Posters and Random Selection for Presentation: | Every accepted paper will be allocated a poster presentation slot. However, due to ever-increasing numbers of accepted papers, there will not be a speaking slot for each accepted paper in 2025. Instead, speaking slots will be allocated via random sampling among accepted papers. See | Presentation | . \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \n  \n Topics \n  Dates \n  Dissemination \n  Presentation \n  Review Process \n  Submission Guidelines \n  TOPICS  \n We invite submissions in the following topics:  \n Data Management Systems   \n Benchmarking, monitoring, testing, and tuning database systems \n  Cloud, distributed, decentralized and parallel data management \n  Database systems on emerging hardware \n  Embedded databases, IoT and Sensor networks \n  Storage, indexing, and physical database design \n  Query processing and optimization \n  Transaction processing \n  Data warehousing, OLAP, Analytics \n   \n Models and Languages   \n Data models and semantics \n  Declarative programming languages and optimization \n  Spatial and temporal data management \n  Graphs, social networks, web data, and semantic web \n  Multimedia and information retrieval \n  Uncertain, probabilistic, and approximate databases \n  Streams and complex event processing \n   \n Human-Centric Data Management   \n Data exploration, visualization, query languages, and user interfaces \n  Crowdsourced and collaborative data management \n  User-centric and human-in-the-loop data management \n  Natural language processing for databases \n   \n Data Governance   \n Data provenance and workflows \n  Data integration, information extraction, and schema matching \n  Data quality, data cleaning \n  Data security, privacy, and access control \n  Responsible data management and data fairness \n  Metadata Management \n   \n Modern AI & Data Management   \n Structured queries over unstructured data: images, video, natural language, etc. \n  Natural language queries \n  Machine learning methods for database engine internals \n  Machine learning methods for database tuning \n  Data management and metadata for machine learning pipelines \n  Knowledge base management \n  Data mining \n  Prescriptive Analytics \n   \n Data-Driven Applications   \n Data-intensive (DI) applications \n  Data Science (DS) pipelines \n  Note that submissions in this topic should: | Focus on data life cycle and pipelines in DS applications OR novel data management in DI fields outside our core (e.g., graphics, networking, astronomy). \n  Detail deployed solutions for DS or DI applications. \n  Share real-world experiences. \n  Provide access to systems, datasets, query logs, benchmarks. \n  Describe the impact of the contribution on future research. \n   \n DATES  \n All deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE.

All papers are strongly encouraged to present a poster at these plenaries.  \n The number of SIGMOD submissions has been growing steadily over many years. To accommodate publication growth while maintaining an engaging and communal in-person conference, SIGMOD 2025 will randomly  select a subset of accepted papers for presentation at the conference. Authors of randomly selected papers will be invited to present their paper in a speaking slot at the conference.  \n A random sample of papers ensures a fair selection process, reflects the main themes of the pool of accepted papers, and maintains the principle that all papers regardless of presentation selection are of full SIGMOD quality.  \n REVIEW PROCESS  \n Each submission will receive three  reviews.  \n  In response to community feedback, there will be no  author feedback this year. Moreover, unlike past years, all papers will receive an initial Accept or Reject decision upon completion of reviews. In lieu of the revision requests from prior years, many accepted papers will be assigned a shepherd  to guide authors through revisions. Final acceptance is contingent upon satisfying shepherding requests.  \n   \n Timeline   \n These are rough timelines that are subject to change.  \n Submission to Notification is 6 weeks   \n  \n Week |  \n 0 | Abstract Bidding & Reviewer Assignment \n 1 | Submission and Review \n 2 | Review \n 3 | Review \n 4 | Discussion \n 5 | Discussion \n 6 | Discussion, Shepherd Selection (for all accepted papers; usually main champion) \n\n Notification to Final Submission is 9 weeks   \n  Rejected papers cannot be submitted to SIGMOD until a full year has passed.  \n\n Week |  \n 1 | Authors create and submit revision plan \n 2 | Shepherd reviews plan and submits feedback \n 3 | Shepherd reviews plan and submits feedback \n 4-8 | Authors revise and resubmit \n 9 | Shepherd, AE, Reviewers make final acceptance/rejection decision \n\n Common revision requests can include  \n justify a crucial assumption, \n  improve motivation of the potential benefits of the work, \n  clean up notation, tighten presentation, \n  compare against specific relevant prior work, \n  show experimental results with better data, such as at larger scale or with richer statistical properties. \n   \n Revision requests must be reasonably achievable in time for resubmission, and will not be requested to address lack of technical depth or novelty or where the revised paper will address a substantially different problem from the original.  \n One extra content page is allowed to accommodate the requested revision items. The revised submission should include a cover letter (up to 4 pages) to summarize how the authors have addressed the requested revisions.  \n In addition to the revised submission and cover letter, authors are encouraged to include a visual diff of the original and revised versions (e.g. via latexdiff or word processing tools that Track Changes).  \n SUBMISSION GUIDELINES  \n\n Submission Link | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2025 \n Submission Paper length | 12 pages excluding references \n Appendix | No Appendix \n Camera Ready Paper length | 13 pages excluding references, no appendix \n File type and size | PDF (<= 10 MB) \n Paper size | Letter (8.5” x 11”) \n Format | 2-column ACM Proceedings format: Latex: | sample-sigconf.tex (version 2e) \n  Word: | Interim layout.docx \n  Overleaf: | ACM’s official 2-column template \n Anonymity | Double-anonymity (see below) \n\n No changes to author lists are allowed after submission. \n  No changes to title are allowed after submission except by AE request. \n  Accepted papers will need to be ported to the PACMMOD format for final publication. Do not use PACMMOD format for submission or review. \n   \n Declaring Conflicts of Interest (COI)   \n   \n Each author | is responsible for entering their | ORCID | , own individual domain and PC conflicts on CMT. You can mark your conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting ''Domain Conflicts'' and ''Individual Conflicts''. We expect authors to have a single unique ORCID: the one used at submission will be used for publication. \n  An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions. \n  Conflicts are | not | declared per submission. \n  Conflict declaration must occur prior to paper submission. \n   \n It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members.  \n Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.  \n Definition of Conflict of Interest   \n  A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of the following conditions holds:  \n The PC member is a co-author of the paper. \n  The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past five years. | 1 \n  The PC member has been a collaborator within the past five years. | 2 \n  The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. \n  The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago. \n  The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. \n   \n 1  Short-term associations, such as summer internships do not constitute institutional COIs. E.g., a student who interned at Microsoft should declare as conflicts any individuals in the group they worked with and other collaborators on their projects, but they should not declare a domain conflict with microsoft.com.  \n 2  Collaborations are indicated by prior co-authorships, shared grant funding, and close research relationships, even if those have not yet resulted in common publications. Publications (typically with a large set of authors) that fall outside the traditional sense of research collaborations (e.g., “The Seattle Report on Database Research”, “ Diversity and Inclusion Activities in Database Conferences: A 2021 Report”, etc.) do not in themselves constitute a COI.  \n To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members may be asked to confirm declared conflicts with submitting authors.  \n Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirement   \n  Following the ACM guidelines  a research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 cannot be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for SIGMOD. Furthermore, after you submit a research paper to SIGMOD, you must await the response from SIGMOD and only re-submit elsewhere if your paper is rejected — or withdrawn at your request — from SIGMOD. This restriction applies not only to identical papers but also to papers with a substantial overlap in scientific content and results.  \n To enforce this requirement, the high-level metadata of submissions (title, abstract, list of authors), may be shared with the Program Chairs / Editors of other conferences and journals.  \n Every research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 must present substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. In this context, a prior publication is (a) a paper of five pages or more, presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If a SIGMOD 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication (respecting the double anonymity requirement), and clearly indicate which parts of the work appeared in prior publications and which parts are novel to the current submission.  \n Any violation of this policy will result in the immediate rejection of the submission, as well as in notification to the members of the SIGMOD Executive Committee, the members of the SIGMOD PC, and the editors or chairs of any other forums involved.   \n Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects   \n  As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .  \n Inclusion and Diversity in Writing   \n  We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and professions. Both are important in our writing as well. Diversity of representation in writing is a simple but visible avenue to celebrate and ultimately help improve our community's diversity. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Be vigilant and guard against unintentionally exclusionary examples.  \n Please visit this page for many examples of both exclusionary writing to avoid and inclusive writing that celebrates diversity to consider adopting: https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html  .  \n Authors are further encouraged to follow the tips and guidelines provided at: https://dbdni.github.io/#materials  .  \n Reviewers will be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise. Going further, also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in writing.  \n Please see https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter  for inclusive alternatives for some of the terms commonly used in the computing profession.  \n Policy on Authorship Requirements   \n  We follow the ACM policy on authorship requirements  . Specifically on the use of generative AI tools and technologies, the guidelines note that: \"Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.\"  \n Anonymity Requirements for all submissions   \n  Research track submissions are subject to the double-anonymity requirement.  \n Every research track paper submitted to SIGMOD 2025 will undergo a double-anonymous reviewing process, following the three principles put forward in | (Snodgrass 2007) | : authors should not be required to go to great lengths to anonymize their submissions; comprehensiveness of the review trumps anonymizing efficacy. AEs retain flexibility and authority in managing the reviewing process. \n  PC members and referees, except the Associate Editors, who review the submission will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship from the PC members and referees, authors must at least do the following: Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the submission. \n  Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. \n  Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. \n  The paper’s file name must not identify the authors of the submission. \n  Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors' names in the submission's associated metadata. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file. \n   \n To avoid compromising the double-anonymity requirement, we request that the authors refrain from publicizing and uploading versions of their submitted manuscripts to pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, and other online forums during the reviewing period. If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to SIGMOD.  \n You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:  \n In our previous work [1, 2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, \"A Simple Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10. [2] Jane Smith, \"A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.   \n The solution is to reference one's past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity:  \n In previous work [1, 2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ... Bibliography [1] Jane Smith, \"A Simple Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10. [2] Jane Smith, \"A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.   \n Despite the anonymity requirements, you should still include all relevant work of your own in the references, using the above style; omitting them could potentially reveal your identity by negation. However, self-references should be limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced.  \n Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. The goal is to preserve anonymity while still allowing the reader to fully grasp the context (related past work, including your own) of the submitted paper. In past years, this goal has been achieved successfully by thousands of papers.  \n It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.  \n No exceptions will be made to the double anonymity requirement for Research Track papers. If the authors of a submission feel that double anonymity needs to be violated, for example to reveal the identity of a system, they may consider submission to a SIGMOD track that does not impose a double anonymity requirement, such as the Industry Track.  \n Artifacts and Reproducibility   \n  SIGMOD strives to establish a culture where sharing research artifacts (data, results, code, and scripts) is the norm rather than an exception. SIGMOD reproducibility has three goals: (a) Highlighting the impact of database research papers; (b) enabling easy dissemination of research results; and (c) enabling easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In this context, we expect all papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available if this is possible. Although it is not mandatory for acceptance, providing this extra material can help reviewers evaluate your work more thoroughly. Papers published at SIGMOD which have been successfully reproduced are also recognized and highlighted as such in the ACM Digital Library.  \n Please include a link with your materials in the text box provided in the submission form at the time of submission. For all Research Track submissions, the link and materials should preserve anonymity. For example this may be an anonymous GitHub repository. You may want to make sure that the link you provide is not indexed by search engines. On GitHub, you can do so by adding the following to the page head:  \n <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">   \n We recognize that at the time of submission authors focus on fine-tuning the paper, and so we expect this link to be live within one week from submission. Reviewers that may need to look at the materials will not do so earlier than that. We do not expect a fully polished submission in terms of automatically reproducing results, but rather a reasonably clean version of the state of the code when submitting the paper. Please, do not use a shortened link which traces who accesses it.  \n In the event that you are not able to submit your code, data, scripts, and notebooks please explain in the text box provided in the submission form why this is the case."

Presenting a poster is a good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper. Posters should not be previously published, as a paper or a poster.  \n Any topic relevant to the conference focus areas is suitable for presentation as a poster. These include new results and insights around developing, implementing, or evaluating computing programs, curricula, and courses. However, the topic should lend itself to presentation in poster format with additional details available in a handout or web page. You might consider a poster presentation of teaching materials that you would like to share or preliminary research findings, such as:  \n imaginative assignments \n  innovative curriculum design \n  laboratory materials \n  effective ideas for recruiting and retaining students \n  pilot study completed \n  data collected, initial results \n  computing education research that is in a preliminary stage \n  Graduate or undergraduate students submitting posters may instead wish to submit to the ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) held at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. Like normal posters, ACM SRC posters are displayed at the conference, but the top poster authors also present their work orally, may win prizes and proceed to the international ACM Student Research Competition. Authors should submit to only one of the two tracks (posters or SRC), not to both. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  \n Authors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2025 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies  and those articulated by ACM  . If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  for clarification prior to submission.  \n ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCID ID in advance of submitting your work.  \n Presentation Modality   \n One author of each accepted poster submission must present their work in-person at the conference. There will be no remote poster presentations.  \n   \n Dates    \n\n  This program is tentative and subject to change.  \n   Program Display Configuration  \n   \n   Time Zone   \n   \n The program is currently displayed in (GMT-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)  .

You will not submit the actual PDF of the poster itself for review.  \n Poster submissions to the SIGCSE TS 2025 must be made through EasyChair  no later than Monday, 14 October 2024. The track chairs reserve the right to desk reject submissions that are incomplete after the deadline has passed.  \n Important Dates   \n  \n Due Date | Monday, 14 October 2024 \n Due Time | 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) \n Submission Limits | 2 pages \n Notification to Authors | Monday, 18 November 2024 tentative \n Submission Link | https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigcsets2025 \n Session Duration | 2 hours \n\n Instructions for Authors  \n   \n Poster submissions can be up 2-pages long and must include: a 250-word short abstract, additional content about the work, and references.  \n Authors may find it useful to read the Instruction for Reviewers  and the Review Form  to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info  .  \n Abstracts   \n All poster submissions must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with the submission metadata, and it should be included in the PDF version of the submission at the appropriate location.  \n Submission Templates   \n All poster submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).   \n Here is a Sample Poster Submission  , which is formatted using this template with optional line numbers. It also has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.  \n Page Limits:  Poster submissions are limited to a maximum of 2 pages of content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, supplemental material, and references).  \n MS Word Authors:  Please use the interim Word template  provided by ACM.  \n LaTeX Authors:   \n Overleaf provides a suitable | two-column sig conference proceedings template | . \n  Other LaTeX users may alternatively use the | ACM Primary template | , adding the “ | sigconf | ” format option in the | documentclass | to obtain the 2-column format. \n  Requirements for Double Anonymous Review Process:  At the time of submission all entries should include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, and email address), followed by an abstract, body content, and references. For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information should be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (i.e. one block per author, with four lines for name, institution, address, and email; not more than three columns of blocks). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers.  \n Other requirements:  Include space for authors’ e-mail addresses on separate lines. Even if multiple authors have the same affiliation, grouping authors’ names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ‘e-mail alias’ is not acceptable, e.g., {anon1,anon2,anon3}@university.edu  or firstname.lastname@college.org  . NOTE: Poster submissions may omit the following sections from the standard ACM template: keywords, CCS Concepts  . Update since 2024:  Because Poster submissions are 2-pages long this year, they should include BOTH the ACM Copyright Block and the ACM Reference Format.   \n Desk rejects:  Submissions that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.  \n Accessibility:  SIGCSE TS 2025 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.   \n Double Anonymized Review   \n Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the submission  . The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the submission with an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the submission such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the submission. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the submission to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  \n Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  \n Submissions to the poster track are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process  . The reviewers are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  \n The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. This discussion information can be used by the track chairs in addition to the content of the review in making final acceptance decisions.  \n The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not  have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  \n ACM Policies   \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects  ). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. See also the authorship policies  .  \n ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCID ID in advance of submitting your work.  \n   \n Author Checklist  \n   \n Additional details are in the instructions for authors  .   \n Getting ready   \n Make sure that all authors have obtained an | ORCiD | identifier. These identifiers are required for paper submission. \n  Check the author list carefully now and review with your co-authors. The authors on the submission must be the same as the authors on the final version of the work (assuming the work is accepted). Authors may not be added or removed after submission and must also appear in the same order as in the submission. \n  Identify at least one author who is willing to review for the symposium. Have that author or those authors sign up to review at | https://tinyurl.com/review-sigcse25 | . (If they’ve done so already, there is no need to fill out the form a second time.) | Researchers listed as co-authors on three or more submissions must volunteer to review. | (Undergraduate co-authors are exempt from this requirement.) \n  Download an appropriate template. (see | Instructions for Authors | ) \n  Review Additional Format Instructions in Instructions for Authors Tab- be sure you have included all required items. \n  Review the | additional resources | . \n  Review the | instructions for reviewers | and the | Review Form | to see what reviewers will be looking for in your paper. \n  Look at the list of topics in the Info menu on this site or on EasyChair and pick 3-7 appropriate topics for your submission. \n  Look at the | EasyChair submission page | to make sure you’ll be prepared to fill everything out. Note that you are permitted to update your submission until the deadline, so it is fine to put draft information there as you get ready. \n  IMPORTANT: no author names should be added to the PDF of your submission as the review process is double-anonymous. \n  The submission on EasyChair   \n Note  : EasyChair does not let you save incomplete submission forms. Please fill out all of the fields in one sitting and save them. After that, you can continue to update the information in the fields and your submission until the deadline.   \n Use an appropriate template. \n  Ensure that your submission is accessible. See | accessibility tips for authors | for further details. \n  Ensure that your submission does not exceed the page limit. \n  For the double anonymous review process, ensure that your submission contains no author names or affiliations, but that you have left space for them, as per the instructions for authors. \n  The authors list in the EasyChair submission form should match exactly what you plan the non-anonymized author list to be in your camera-ready final submission (if the submission is accepted). Author lists can NOT be modified (this includes add/remove/reorder) \n  Submit the final version | by 11:59 p.m. AOE, Monday, 14 October 2024. \n    \n Post-Acceptance and Presentation Information  \n   \n What Gets Published?   \n The full 2-page extended abstract for each accepted poster will be published in the SIGCSE TS 2025 proceedings.  \n Presentation Details   \n By SIGCSE policy, at least one  author of an accepted poster is required to register, attend, and present the work. SIGCSE TS 2025 posters will be presented only in-person.  \n Please print your poster in advance and bring it with you to the conference. The poster board size is 4 foot tall by 8 foot wide (48in x 96in), so a standard 36\" by 48” poster would work well. Please arrive 15-20 minutes before your session to get set up. Each poster station will have push pins available. Please take down and remove your poster at the end of the session. At least one of the Poster Track Co-Chairs will be present at each session.  \n   \n Resources  \n   \n Suggestions for poster design are given in Creating Effective Academic Posters  (UC Davis) and Research Posters 101  ( ACM Crossroads  article). While both of these references provide suggestions for student researchers, the ideas are also applicable to posters for this conference.  \n For samples of accepted posters, see prior SIGCSE TS proceedings. For example, posters for SIGCSE TS 2023 may be found at https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3545947#heading9  and a sample poster from that list can be found at https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3545947.3576292  .  \n Sample Poster Submission   \n Here’s a Sample Poster Submission with Notes  that is in the correct format and has additional notes about what is required.  \n Language Editing Assistance   \n ACM has partnered with International Science Editing (ISE)  to provide language editing services to ACM authors. ISE offers a comprehensive range of services for authors including standard and premium English language editing, as well as illustration and translation services. Editing services are at author expense and do not guarantee publication of a manuscript.  \n   \n Instructions for Reviewers  \n\n Reviewing Phase | Start Date | End Date \n Reviewing | Thursday, 17 October 2024 | Thursday, 31 October 2024 \n Discussion & Recommendations | Friday, 1 November 2024 | Friday, 8 November 2024 \n  \n Table of Contents   \n Overview \n  Submission and Review System \n  Dual-Anonymous Review Process \n  Getting Started Reviewing \n  Poster Review Guidelines \n  Poster Review Process Steps \n  Discussion \n  Recalcitrant Reviewers \n  Overview   \n Posters provide an opportunity for an informal presentation featuring “give and take” with conference attendees. Presenting a poster is also a good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper. Posters should not be previously published (neither as a paper nor as a poster).  \n Poster submissions will be reviewed using the dual-anonymous review process (see below).  \n Submission and Review System   \n The review process for SIGCSE TS 2025 will be done using the EasyChair submission system ( https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sigcsets2025  ). Reviewers will be invited to join/login into EasyChair, update their profile, and select 3-5 topics that they are most qualified to review. To do so, reviewers select SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My topics from the menu and select at most 5 topics. More topics make it harder for the EasyChair system to make a good set of matches. Reviewers also identify their Conflicts of Interest by selecting SIGCSE TS 2025 > Conference > My Conflicts.  \n Dual-Anonymous Review Process   \n Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the submission. The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the submission with an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the submission such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the submission. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the submission to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.  \n Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].  \n Submissions to the Posters track are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process. The reviewers are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers are anonymous to each other and to the authors.  \n The reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. An Associate Program Chair (APC) will help move the discussion forward. This discussion information can be used by the Track Chairs in addition to the content of the review in making final decisions.  \n The SIGCSE TS 2025 review process does not have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.  \n Getting Started Reviewing   \n Before starting your review, you may be asked by the Track Chairs to declare conflicts with any submitting authors. Please do so in a timely manner so we can avoid conflicts during assignment.  \n As a Reviewer, we ask that you carefully read each submission assigned to you and write a constructive review that concisely summarizes what you believe the submission to be about. When reviewing a submission, consider:  \n the strengths and weaknesses, \n  the contribution to an outstanding SIGCSE TS 2025 program and experience for attendees, and \n  how it brings new ideas or extends current ideas through replication to the field and to practitioners and researchers of computing education. \n  Poster Review Guidelines   \n Keep in mind that posters are meant to be a place to present and receive feedback on work that is in progress. Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.  \n Reviewers will be asked to summarize the work; provide their familiarity with the submission topic; evaluate the contribution, background and relation work, approach and uniqueness, and results and conclusions; provide written comments including strengths and weaknesses of the submissions; and provide an overall evaluation.  \n We strongly recommend that you prepare your review in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.   \n While your review text should clearly support your scores and recommendation, please do not include your preference for acceptance or rejection of a submission in the feedback to the authors. Instead, use the provided radio buttons to make a recommendation (the authors will not see this) based on your summary review and provide any details that refer to your recommendation directly in the confidential comments to the APC or Track Chairs. Remember that as a reviewer, you will only see a small portion of the submissions, so one that you recommend for acceptance may be rejected when considering the other reviewer recommendations and the full set of submissions.  \n Poster Review Process Steps   \n Step 1: Authors submit Posters   \n As indicated in the Instructions for Authors  , submissions are supposed to be sufficiently anonymous so that the reviewer cannot determine the identity or affiliation of the authors. The main purpose of the anonymous reviewing process is to reduce the influence of potential (positive or negative) biases on reviewers’ assessments. You should be able to review the work without knowing the authors or their affiliations. Do not try to find out the identity of authors. When in doubt, please contact the Track Chairs.  \n Step 2: Reviewers and APCs Submit Topics and Conflicts   \n Reviewers and APCs select topics they feel most qualified to review. This helps the system prioritize posters for review assignment. Reviewers and APCs enter conflicts. Note that these steps MUST be completed for the Poster Track even if they were already completed for another track. The topics and conflicts do not propagate across tracks.  \n Step 3: Track Chairs Decide on Desk Rejects   \n The Track Chairs will quickly review each poster submission to determine whether it violates anonymization requirements, formatting requirements, or length restrictions. Authors of desk-rejected posters will be notified immediately. The Track Chairs may not catch every issue. If you see something during the review process that you believe should be desk rejected, contact the Track Chairs at posters@sigcse2025.sigcse.org  before you write a review. The Track Chairs, in consultation with the Program Chairs, will make the final judgment about whether something is a violation, and give you guidance on whether and if so how to write a review. Note that Track Chairs with conflicts of interest are excluded from deciding on desk-rejected posters, leaving the decision to the other Track Chair.  \n Step 4: Track Chairs Assign Reviewers and APCs   \n The Track Chairs will collaboratively assign at least three Reviewers and one APC for each poster submission. The Track Chairs will be advised by the submission system assignment algorithm. Reviewing assignments can only be made by a Track Chair without a conflict of interest.  \n Step 5a: Reviewers Review Posters   \n Assigned Reviewers submit their anonymous reviews by the review deadline, reviewing each of their assigned submissions against the Poster Reviewing Guidelines  . We strongly recommend that you prepare your rationale in a separate document; EasyChair has been known to time out.  Note that Reviewers must NOT include accept or reject decisions in their review text.  (They will indicate accept/reject recommendations separately.)  \n Due to the internal and external (publication) deadlines, we generally cannot give reviewers or APCs extensions. Note that reviewers, APCs, and Track Chairs with conflicts cannot see any of the reviews of the posters for which they have conflicts of interest during this process.  \n Step 5b: APCs and Track Chairs Monitor Review Progress   \n APCs and Track Chairs periodically check in to ensure that progress is being made. If needed, Track Chairs send email reminders to the reviewers with the expectations and timelines. If needed, the Program Chairs and Track Chairs recruit emergency reviewers if any of the submissions do not have a sufficient number of reviews, if there is lots of variability in the reviews, or if an expert review is needed.  \n Step 6: Discussion between Reviewers and APCs   \n The discussion period provides the opportunity for the Reviewers and the APCs to discuss the reviews and reach an agreement on the quality of the submission relative to the expectations for the track to which it was submitted. The APCs  are expected to take a leadership role and moderate the discussion. Reviewers  are expected to engage in the discussion when prompted by other Reviewers and/or by the APCs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  \n During the discussion period, Reviewers are able to revise their reviews but are NOT required to do so. It is important that at no point Reviewers feel forced to change their reviews, scores, or viewpoints in this process. The APC can disagree with the reviewers and communicate this to the Track Chairs if needed. Everyone is asked to do the following:  \n Read all the reviews of all posters assigned (and re-read your own reviews). \n  Engage in a discussion about sources of disagreement. \n  Use the | Poster Reviewing Guidelines | to guide your discussions. \n  Be polite, friendly, and constructive at all times. \n  Be responsive and react as soon as new information comes in. \n  Remain open to other reviewers shifting your judgments. \n  Explicitly state any clarifying questions that could change your evaluation of the poster \n  Step 7: Track Chairs & Program Chairs Make Decisions & Notify Authors   \n The Track Chairs go through all the submissions and read all the reviews to ensure clarity and as much consistency with the review process and its criteria as possible. APCs are consulted if needed. Poster submissions do not receive meta-reviews in general, but in a small number of cases Track Chairs may write brief meta-reviews to share their interpretation of reviews. The Track Chairs make recommendations to the Program Chairs based on the reviews and their own expertise as well as a desire to provide an appropriately varied program. The Program Chairs then make final decisions and notify all authors of the decisions about their posters via the submission system.  \n Step 8: Evaluation   \n The Evaluation Chairs send out surveys to authors, reviewers, and APCs. Please take the time to respond to these surveys, as they inform processes and policies for future SIGCSE Technical Symposia. The Track Chairs also request feedback from the APCs on the quality of reviews as a metric to be used for future invitations to review for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  \n Discussion   \n The discussion and recommendation period provides the opportunity for the Track Chairs to discuss reviews and feedback so they can provide the best recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs and that the submission is given full consideration in the review process. We ask that Reviewers engage in discussion when prompted by other reviewers, the APC, or the Track Chairs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair. During this period you will be able to revise your review based on the discussion, but you are not required to do so.  \n The Track Chairs will make a final recommendation to the Program Chairs from your feedback.  \n Recalcitrant Reviewers   \n Reviewers who don’t submit reviews, have reviews with limited constructive feedback, do not engage effectively in the discussion phase, or submit inappropriate reviews will be removed from the reviewer list (as per SIGCSE policy  ). Recalcitrant reviewers will be informed of their removal from the reviewer list. Reviewers with repeated offenses (two within a three-year period) will be removed from SIGCSE reviewing for three years.  \n   \n Review Form  \n   \n The following text represents the review form.   \n Summary  : Please provide a brief summary of the submission, its audience, and its main point(s).  \n Familiarity  : Rate your personal familiarity with the topic area of this submission in relation to your research or practical experience.  \n The contribution is clearly described  : Select your rating.  \n Background and Related Work  : Please rate the background and related work of this poster submission.  \n Approach and Uniqueness  : Please rate the approach and uniqueness of this poster submission.  \n Results and Contribution  : Please rate the results and contribution of this poster submission.  \n Overall evaluation  : Please provide a detailed justification that includes constructive feedback that summarizes the strengths & weaknesses of the submission and clarifies your scores. Both the score and the review text are required, but remember that the authors will not see the overall recommendation score (only your review text). You should NOT directly include your preference for acceptance or rejection in your review.  \n\n Submission Link   \n   \n   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigcsets2025     \n   \n Track Chairs    \n   \n Ashish Aggarwal Posters Co-Chair (posters@sigcse2025.sigcse.org)    \n University of Florida   \n United States \n  Kalpathi Subramanian Posters Co-Chair (posters@sigcse2025.sigcse.org)    \n The University of North Carolina at Charlotte   \n United States \n\n x  Mon 2 Dec 14:35    \n\n  SIGCSE TS 2025   \n  contact form    \n  using conf.researchr.org  ( v1.67.1  )  \n   Support page    \n     \n SIGCSE TS 2025  \n Keynotes   \n  Papers   \n  Panels   \n  Special Sessions   \n  Tutorials   \n  ACM Student Research Competition   \n  Birds of a Feather   \n  Demos   \n  Lightning Talks   \n  Nifty Assignments   \n  Posters   \n  Affiliated Events   \n  Journal First   \n  Supporter Sessions   \n  Logistics    \n\n Attending  \n Registration   \n  Hotels and Roommates   \n  Venue Information   \n  Student Volunteers   \n  Kids' Camp   \n  SIGCSE TS Travel Grant Donations   \n  Safe and Respectful Environment   \n  Pittsburgh Information"

A strong emphasis of GROUP conferences is to foster a discourse on collaborative technology that bridges the fields of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Information Systems (IS), Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), and “Learning at the workplace” (CSCL@Work). Relevant issues include the design, implementation, deployment, evaluation, and impact of these systems as well as examinations of relevant research methodologies. The conference integrates work in social science, computer science, engineering, design, values, and other diverse topics related to group work, broadly conceptualized.  \n Conference History:  \n GROUP’25, January 12-15, 2025, Hilton Head Island, SC, USA  \n Conference program TBD  \n Workshops:  \n  Beyond video-conferencing: telepresence technologies for extending expertise reach and specialised skill sharing  \n  Time, Power, and the Future of Work  \n Keynotes:  \n  AI, Responsibility, and Social Impact: Collaboration and Cooperation Mechanisms in Conversational Systems  \n  \n GROUP’23, January 8-11, 2023, Hilton Head Island, SC, USA  \n Note: The regular conference venue (Sanibel Island, FL, USA) for 2023 changed due to the hurricane damage.

The SIGCSE Technical Symposium addresses problems common among educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate computing programs, curricula, and courses. The symposium provides a forum for sharing new ideas for syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of instruction. The symposium provides a diverse selection of technical sessions and opportunities for learning and interaction.  \n SIGCSE TS 2024 will be held from 20–23 March 2024 at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon. While SIGCSE TS 2024 will be primarily an in-person conference, there will be some limited online participation options  .  \n Still Hybrid in 2024!   \n SIGCSE TS 2024 will continue to be a hybrid event. Some aspects of the conference will be only available to in-person attendees. However, online participants will be able to participate in:  \n Keynotes \n  A selection of panels and special sessions \n  A selection of live online paper presentations \n  A selection of online workshops \n  Nifty Assignments \n  The legendary SIGCSE Coffee Break Show \n  The online conference communication platform \n  The remaining aspects of SIGCSE TS 2024—including BoFs, Demos, Lightning Talks, Posters, and the ACM Student Research Competition—will be offered only in person. Online registration will be significantly  cheaper than in-person registration (approximately 1/3 the price) in most cases. Our hope is that this will give everyone an opportunity to present their research at the 2024 SIGCSE Technical Symposium, even if they are unable to travel, and that it will provide an affordable option to enjoy some of the symposium’s content for those that can’t attend in person.  \n Submission Information   \n We will continue to use EasyChair  for SIGCSE TS 2024.  \n We are not requiring ACM TAPS  for SIGCSE TS 2024.  \n We will continue to use the ACM two-column format for papers, posters, panels, special sessions, lightning talks, demos, and the ACM SRC. Workshops and Birds-of-a-feather submissions will now use forms rather than PDFs. Nifty will continue to expect a zipped folder.  \n Submission Link  : https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigcsets2024   \n Reviewing Information   \n To volunteer to review for SIGCSE TS 2024, please visit https://bit.ly/review-SIGCSE2024  . If you are not sure whether or not you have already volunteered to review, please send email to program@sigcse2024.sigcse.org.  \n New for 2024   \n ORCiD IDs  : ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors ( https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs  ). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID ( https://orcid.org/register  ) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCID ID in advance of submitting your work.  \n New Review Process for Panels, Special Sessions, and Workshops  : We will be using a new review process for round-one single-anonymous tracks (Panels, Special Sessions, and Workshops). Information on that process can be found in the “Information for Reviewers” tab on any of those tracks.  \n Review Forms  : In the interest of transparency, we have provided the text of the review form for each track as a separate tab on that track.  \n Author’s Checklists  : to help authors create submissions that meet all the requirements for a specific track, as a separate tab on each track.  \n Expanded Topic List  : We have expanded the topic list to include Broadening Participation in Computing as a separate set of topics. Since BPC relates to each of our other categories (Computing Topics, Education and Experience Topics, Curriculum Topics, and Methods Topics), we have given BPC its own category. We also anticipate that using these topics will better ensure that reviewers are familiar with the particular topics.  \n Outstanding Reviewer Awards  : We plan to select a small group of paper reviewers as “outstanding reviewers” based on feedback from APCs.  \n Important Deadlines   \n  \n Round One | Papers, Panels, Special Sessions, Workshops \n Abstract Due Date (Papers Only) | Friday, 11 August 2023 \n Abstract Due Time (Papers Only) | 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) \n Round One Due Date | Friday, 18 August 2023 \n Round One Due Time | 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) \n Round One Notification to Authors  * | Monday, 2 October 2023 tentative \n Round Two | ACM Student Research Competition, BoFs, Demos, Lightning Talks, Nifty Assignments, Posters \n Round Two Due Date | Friday, 13 October 2023 \n Round Two Due Time | 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) \n Round Two Notification to Authors | Monday, 13 November 2023 tentative \n Final Submissions Due (for accepted work) | December (precise dates to be determined) \n\n Supporters  \n   \n Platinum  \n\n   Gold  \n\n   Silver  \n\n   Are you interested in supporting the SIGCSE Technical Symposium, or being an exhibitor?

Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas.  \n Submission format:  Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see below)  , and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the \"full version\" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  \n   \n  Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  \n   \n  STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing  , and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not \"We build on our previous work…\" but rather \"We build on the work of…\").  \n   \n  The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  \n   \n  All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.  \n   \n  PC Member Submissions:  Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed.  \n   \n  Recommended Best Practices for References:  Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages.  \n   \n  Authors are asked to avoid \"et al.\" in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing \"\\cite{XYZ} show...\" instead of \"X et al. show\". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \\bibliographystyle{alpha} or \\bibliographystyle{alphaurl}.  \n Conflict of Interest Policy:  The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see here  ) and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy  . Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories:  \n Family member or close friend. \n  Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. \n  Person with the same affiliation. \n  Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) \n  Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). \n  Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. \n  If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate  affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate.  \n Submission Instructions:  Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing).  \n The submission server  is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.   \n It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.  \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:  The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions.  \n Presentation of Accepted Papers:  One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference. Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.  \n Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n  \n Dates and other relevant information:  \n Paper submission deadline:  Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST. There is no separate abstract submission deadline.  \n   \n  Notification date:  by email on or before February 1, 2025.  \n   \n  Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:  A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 31, 2025. The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the ACM Format  , and specifically the sigconf option. (LaTeX users, please use: \\documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}). Additional instructions will be sent directly to the authors of accepted papers.  \n   \n  STOC talks:  Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025.  \n   \n Publication date:  AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  \n Best Paper Award:  The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible. In addition to the standard COI-avoidance, the final designation process will be conducted by the subset of PC Members with no submission to the conference. Rules for the award can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html  .  \n Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:  A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission. To inform the program committee about a paper's eligibility, check the appropriate box in the web form on the submission server. The list of past winners can be found at https://www.sigact.org/prizes/student.html  .  \n Access to Proceedings:  The committee intends to provide registered attendees with internet access to the Proceedings on a password-protected site that will be available from about two weeks before the conference until the end of the conference. Authors can opt out of this online distribution by contacting the program committee chair by March 19, 2025.  \n Student Travel Awards:  SIGACT provides travel awards to students without available support, and researchers from developing countries. More information on the award process will be posted later on.  \n Program Committee:  \n  \n Amir Abboud  (ToC Advocate)  , Weizmann Institute of Science  \n  Pankaj K.

(In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions. PC Member Submissions: Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed. Recommended Best Practices for References: Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages. Authors are asked to avoid \"et al.\" in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing \"\\cite{XYZ} show...\" instead of \"X et al. show\". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \\bibliographystyle{alpha} or \\bibliographystyle{alphaurl}. Conflict of Interest Policy: The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see here) and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy. Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories: Family member or close friend. Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. Person with the same affiliation. Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate affiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate. Submission Instructions: Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing). The submission server is scheduled to open on Oct. 1, 2024. It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline. ACM is moving to require ORCIDs for all authors. An ORCID is an identifier that uniquely identifies an author. It connects an author's work even if there are variations in the names used on different papers, ensuring that the author gets credit for all of their contributions. Using ORCIDs will help ACM administer the ACM OPEN program where universities get open-access publishing via a subscription, aid in identifying conflicts of interests, and support other publications processes. ORCIDs are easy to obtain; it takes less than a minute. Prior and Simultaneous Submissions: The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions. Presentation of Accepted Papers: One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference.

Researchers and developers in these areas are addressing many similar problems but with different backgrounds and approaches. LCTES is intended to expose researchers and developers from either area to relevant work and interesting problems in the other area and provide a forum where they can interact.  \n LCTES’23 is co-located with PLDI  and FCRC 2023  , sharing the venue and activities with ten top computer science conferences.  \n Proceedings   \n The proceedings for LCTES 2023 are now available in the ACM Digital Library  .  \n Attendance policy   \n Accepted papers must be presented at LCTES 2023 to appear in the proceedings. Since FCRC is an in-person conference, presentations must be in person and the presenter must register for LCTES. Under special circumstances, pre-recorded presentations are allowed but require three virtual PLDI registrations to help us cover the cost of the proceedings.

Embedded systems are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore, they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these issues, such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints.  \n The 24th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2023) solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted to https://lctes23.hotcrp.com/  .  \n\n Important Dates   \n Paper submission deadline: March 24, 2023 (extended firm deadline) \n  Paper notification: April 24, 2023 \n  AE submission deadline: May 1, 2023 \n  AE notification: May 12, 2023 \n  Camera-ready deadline: May 15, 2023 \n  Conference: June 18, 2023 \n\n Paper Categories   \n Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work. \n  Work-in-progress paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions. \n  Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, this year’s LCTES introduces two journal modes.  \n All accepted full papers will be invited to be published in a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS). A TECS publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process. \n  Rejected full papers may have the option to submit their work to the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL; 4 pages). IEEE ESL submissions will undergo a separate review process. \n\n Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest including, but not limited to:   \n Programming language challenges   \n Domain-specific languages \n  Features to exploit multicore, reconfigurable, and other emerging architectures \n  Features for distributed, adaptive, and real-time control embedded systems \n  Capabilities for specification, composition, and construction of embedded systems \n  Language features and techniques to enhance reliability, verifiability, and security \n  Virtual machines, concurrency, inter-processor synchronization, and memory management \n  Compiler challenges   \n Interaction between embedded architectures, operating systems, and compilers \n  Interpreters, binary translation, just-in-time compilation, and split compilation \n  Support for enhanced programmer productivity \n  Support for enhanced debugging, profiling, and exception/interrupt handling \n  Optimization for low power/energy, code/data size, and real-time performance \n  Parameterized and structural compiler design space exploration and auto-tuning \n  Tools for analysis, specification, design, and implementation, including: \n  Hardware, system software, application software, and their interfaces \n  Distributed real-time control, media players, and reconfigurable architectures \n  System integration and testing \n  Performance estimation, monitoring, and tuning \n  Run-time system support for embedded systems \n  Design space exploration tools \n  Support for system security and system-level reliability \n  Approaches for cross-layer system optimization \n  Theory and foundations of embedded systems   \n Predictability of resource behavior: energy, space, time \n  Validation and verification, in particular of concurrent and distributed systems \n  Formal foundations of model-based design as the basis for code generation, analysis, and verification \n  Mathematical foundations for embedded systems \n  Models of computations for embedded applications \n  Novel embedded architectures   \n Design and implementation of novel architectures \n  Workload analysis and performance evaluation \n  Architecture support for new language features, virtualization, compiler techniques, debugging tools \n  Architectural features to improve power/energy, code/data size, and predictability \n  Mobile systems and IoT   \n Operating systems for mobile and IoT devices \n  Compiler and software tools for mobile and IoT systems \n  Energy management for mobile and IoT devices \n  Memory and IO techniques for mobile and IoT devices \n\n ACM Publications Policies   \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  \n  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start, and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  \n\n Authors take note   \n The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  \n\n Submission  \n  \n  Submissions must be in ACM SIGPLAN subformat of the acmart format (available at and explained in more detail at https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/  ). Each paper should be in 10pt font and have no more than 10 pages for full papers  or 4 pages for work-in-progress papers  , excluding the bibliography. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al.  ). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Submissions must be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4-sized paper. For papers in the work-in-progress category, add the suffix “(WIP)” to your title, such as “Title (WIP)”  .  \n To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules:  \n author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, \n  references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). \n  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here  . Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.  \n\n ACM Publications Policies   \n By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  .

Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This submission is voluntary but strongly encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.  \n At LCTES, we follow ACM’s artifact review and badging policy, version 1.1  . ACM describes a research artifact as follows:  \n By “artifact” we mean a digital object created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results.  \n  \n Submission of an artifact does not imply automatic permission to make its content public. AEC members will be instructed that they may not publicize any part of the submitted artifacts during or after completing the evaluation, and they will not retain any part of any artifact after evaluation. Thus, you can include models, data files, proprietary binaries, and similar items in your artifact.  \n We expect each artifact to receive three reviews. Papers that pass the Artifact Evaluation process will receive up to three ACM artifact evaluation badge(s) directly printed on the paper and available as meta information in the ACM Digital Library.  \n Artifact evaluation is single-blind. Please take precautions (e.g., turning off analytics and logging) to help prevent accidentally learning the reviewers’ identities.  \n Badging   \n The papers with accepted artifacts will be assigned official ACM artifact evaluation badges based on the criteria defined by ACM  . The AEC awards up to three types of badges that reflect the evaluation (red), availability (green), and validation (blue) of the artifact and the results of the paper. Refer to the ACM website  for detailed badge information. Note that artifacts will be evaluated with respect to the claims and presentation in the submitted version of the paper, not the camera-ready version   .  \n The awarded badges will appear on the first page of the camera-ready version of the paper. Artifact authors will be allowed to revise their camera-ready paper after being notified of their artifact’s publication to include a link to the artifact’s DOI.  \n Note that we only award the “Reproducibility” (dark blue) badge but not the “Replication” (light blue) one.  \n Guidelines   \n Carefully think which badge(s) you seek to receive | . | If your only goal is to publish your code, seek the “Availability” (green) badge. The reviewers will not exercise the artifact for its functionality or validate the paper’s claims. \n  If you wish you have your results reproduced without making your artifact documented, consistent, complete, and exercisable, seek the “Reproducibility” (blue) badge rather than the “Functionality/Reusability” (red) badge. \n  If you do not want to make the artifact available publicly, do not seek the “Availability” (green) badge. \n  Minimize the artifact setup overhead | . | A well-packaged artifact is easily usable by the reviewers and conveys the value of your work. A great way to package an artifact is as a VM image or Docker container that runs “out of the box.” We encourage authors to include pre-built binaries along with the source and build scripts that allow the AEC to regenerate the binaries to guarantee maximum transparency. Pre-built VM or docker images are preferred over scripts that build the image since this alleviates reliance on external dependencies. Make sure to test your artifact on at least one machine different than the one you used to prepare the artifact to identify missing dependencies. \n  Giving AE reviewers remote access to your machines with preinstalled (proprietary) software is possible. \n  Preparing the Artifact   \n You should make your artifact available as a single archive file and use the naming convention <paper #>.<suffix>  , where the appropriate suffix is used for the given archive format. Use a commonly-available compressed archive format such as .tgz, .tbz2, or .zip and open document formats. The link to download your artifact must protect the anonymity of the reviewers (e.g., a Google Drive URL).  \n The compressed archive should consist of three pieces:  \n The submission version of your accepted paper. \n  A | README | file (PDF or plaintext format) that explains your artifact (details below). \n  A folder containing the artifact. \n  The README.txt  should consist of two parts:  \n a | Getting Started Guide | and \n  Step-by-Step Instructions | that detail how your artifact can be evaluated. Include appropriate references to the relevant sections of your paper. \n  The Getting Started Guide  should contain instructions on how to set up (including, for example, a pointer to the VM player software, its version, and passwords if needed) and test your artifact. Anyone following this guide should be able to handle the rest of your artifact easily.  \n The Step by Step Instructions  explain how to reproduce experiments or other activities supporting your paper’s conclusions. Write this for readers who are deeply interested in your work and are studying to improve or compare against it. If your artifact runs for more than a few minutes, point this out and explain how to run it on smaller inputs.  \n Where appropriate, include descriptions of and links to files (included in the archive) that represent the expected outputs   such as log files generated by your tool for a given set of inputs. If there are warnings that can be ignored, explain what they are.  \n Further, include the following:  \n A list of claims from the paper supported by the artifact. Explain how and why the artifact supports those claims. \n  A list of claims from the paper | not | supported by the artifact. Explain why the artifact does not support those claims. Examples: performance claims cannot be reproduced in a VM, authors cannot redistribute specific benchmarks, etc. \n  When preparing your artifact, please keep in mind:  \n How accessible you are making your artifact to other researchers. \n  The AEC members will have a limited time to assess your artifact. \n  Artifact Evaluation Committee   \n Other than the chair, the AEC members are senior graduate students, postdocs, or recent Ph.D. graduates, identified with the help of the LCTES PC and recent artifact evaluation committees. Please check SIGPLAN’s Empirical Evaluation Guidelines  for some methodologies to consider during evaluation.  \n Throughout the review period, reviews will be submitted to HotCRP and continuously visible to authors. AEC reviewers will be able to continuously interact (anonymously) with authors for clarifications, system-specific patches, and other logistics to help ensure that the artifact can be evaluated. Continuous interaction prevents rejecting artifacts for “wrong library version” types of problems.  \n Our goal is that all submitted artifacts successfully pass the artifact evaluation.   \n\n Speaker's Guide  \n   \n LCTES’23 Speaker’s Guide   \n This document is for those presenting a paper at LCTES’23. If you’re presenting at ISMM, PLDI, or a PLDI tutorial or workshop, please see the Speaker’s Guide on the page for the corresponding conference/track.  \n Congratulations on having your paper accepted at LCTES’23! This document will help ensure your presentation runs smoothly and has the best possible audience impact. Please read it in its entirety.  \n Checklist   \n Before LCTES:  \n Prepare and | practice | . \n  Ensure your talk runs for | no more than 15 minutes | . \n  Sign up for Discord | ( | details here | ). \n  Upload a backup copy of your talk slides | (details below). \n  Check the program | to establish when and where your talk will be. \n  Ensure you have a | HDMI adaptor | for your device. \n  Before your talk:  \n Familiarize yourself with the room | you will be speaking in. \n  Find and | introduce yourself to your session chair | . \n  Find the Discord channel | for your session, so you can monitor questions. \n  Attend the mandatory video check | before your session (details below). \n  Ensure that you are in the room no later than 5 minutes before your session. \n  After your talk:  \n Expect | questions from the floor | and session chair. \n  Once you’ve completed your talk and Q&A, | monitor Discord for follow-up questions | . \n  Preparing Your Talk   \n Your work will have a greater impact if you’re well prepared.  \n It is very important that you run to schedule. The LCTES’23 schedule is extremely tight, with hard stops imposed by FCRC scheduling. Session chairs have been asked to stick rigidly to the schedule.  \n Guidelines   \n Your talk should run for no more than 16 minutes | , uninterrupted. This gives you about three minutes for questions and one minute for speaker change-over. \n  Your talk should be prepared for the standard | 16:9 widescreen ratio | . If your talk is in a different ratio, at best it will be | pillarboxed | , wasting screen real estate and diminishing impact, and at worst, it won’t display correctly. \n  You will present your talk from a lectern, using a fixed lectern mic. \n  You will need to provide your talk ahead of time in either pdf or powerpoint. \n  If you have an embedded video in your presentation, please inform the video team via Discord and be sure to test it with them before your session. \n  Uploading Your Presentation   \n As an insurance against technical failures, we ask all speakers to make a backup copy of their presentation available to the video team by uploading it the day before the session. You’re welcome to upload fresh copies at any time.  \n Format: your presentation must be saved as a powerpoint or pdf file (sorry!) \n  Naming: you must use your paper ID as your file name (<LCTES paper ID>.[ppt,pptx,pdf], e.g., LCTES-paper43.pptx) \n  Location: please use this link: | https://bit.ly/pldi23upload \n  This requirement gives you assurance that if some major technical problem were to arise (such as a failure of your laptop), you will still be able to give your talk. If you do not make your presentation available in advance, and significant technical problems arise, we may have to shorten your presentation to keep to our tight schedule.  \n The requirement for you to use pdf or powerpoint for your backup copy is a pragmatic tradeoff. These slides will only be used in case of a technical emergency. We want to have the highest possible assurance that they will work without fuss on a third party device should such an emergency occur. If you use Google slides, Keynote, or some other software, please use the export feature to create either powerpoint or pdf backups.  \n If you elect not to upload a backup copy, please understand that this limits our volunteers’ capacity to assist you if a technical problem arises when you give your presentation.  \n Advice   \n There are many excellent sources of advice on giving good talks, including from Simon Peyton Jones  , Michael Hicks  , Michael Ernst  , and Derek Dreyer  . Make good use of these!  \n Mandatory Video Check   \n All speakers are required to be in the room and check in with their session chair and the video team no later than 5 minutes before their session starts. Please note that due to our very tight schedule, speakers who fail to upload their talk in advance and/or fail to attend the video check 5 minutes before their session may have their talk cut short if technical issues arise  .  \n Q&A   \n If you stick to the above schedule you will have about 3 minutes for questions. The in-room audience will be able to ask questions via a queue at a single microphone on a mic stand in the center of the room. In-room attendees and remote attendees will also be able to ask questions via Discord. Your session chair will monitor questions on Discord and might ask questions as they see them appearing there.  \n It is good practice, as the speaker, to repeat your understanding of the question before providing your answer. This is particularly important when time is tight because it reduces opportunities for time being wasted on account of a misunderstanding.  \n Once your talk is finished, please go on to Discord and respond to any questions or follow-up questions that appear there.  \n Remote Audience   \n Your talk will be streamed to Discord and YouTube with live captioning. Your remote audience will be able to write questions in the Discord channel created for your session (they won’t be able to ask questions via audio or video). They should see your slides, a video feed of you speaking, and live captions. As mentioned above, your session chair may relay questions from Discord.  \n Remote Presenters   \n LCTES’23 authors are expected to be present at the conference. If it is impossible for any of the authors to attend LCTES in person, please let the chairs know immediately.  \n Discord   \n We will use Discord as the virtual platform for this conference. You should familiarize yourself with Discord as an audience member well before your talk. We will use it for: a) the remote audience, b) delivery of remote talks, and c) communicating logistics.  \n Remote speakers will receive instructions on how to present your talk over Discord.  \n Connectivity   \n Please do the best you can to ensure that you have good connectivity at the time of your presentation. To protect against the possibility of a major technical failure, we encourage you to record a 15 minute video version of your talk, and share it with the video team well before your talk (see notes above for sharing slides). The video team can then use your video as a back-up in case of a major problem.  \n Limitations   \n Remote speakers should take care before including embedded audio in their talk. While this is possible, it can be difficult. If you need to do this, please consult directly with the video team and have it tested well in advance.  \n Q&A   \n Your session chair will introduce you and field questions just as for in-person sessions. You do not need to monitor Discord during your talk. Your Q&A will involve answering questions verbally, just as for in-person talks, only you’ll do so via video. As with in-person sessions, timing is very tight, so please be sure to stick to your 15 minute speaking time, or risk losing your Q&A time. You can respond to follow-up questions online after your talk has finished.  \n   \n Attendee's Guide  \n   \n Accessing Papers   \n PLDI papers are all open-access and available from the ACM Digital Library. Just follow the small “DOI” link in the PLDI schedule below the paper.  \n In-Person Attendees   \n The venue for PLDI’23 is Orlando World Center Marriott  .  \n The map here  indicates where you’ll find key events.  \n Registration   \n Please make your way to the FCRC registration desk, which will be in “Palms Registration” until Saturday noon, at which point it will move to \" Cypress 2 Alcove\" for the remainder of FCRC. Both are marked on the map above.  \n Welcome Reception   \n We are holding a joint welcome reception with ISCA in Royal from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm on Sunday. Everyone registered for PLDI (or ISCA) is invited.  \n Catering   \n Lunch and breakfast will be in Cypress 3, with the exception of Monday’s PLDI Awards Lunch, which will be held in Cypress 1.  \n Wi-Fi   \n FCRC provides wifi for the whole event. You should receive information on how to access it at the registration desk.  \n Discord   \n In-person attendees are warmly encouraged to use Discord (details below). You can use it to coordinate with colleagues, get updates on activities, and engage with authors via Q&A. You are very welcome to ask questions via each session’s text channel on Discord, before, during, and after the talk. If the session chair has time, they will ask the question on your behalf. Authors have been asked to check their channel for questions, so you can engage with the authors that way if not in person.  \n Virtual Attendees   \n Watching Talks (YouTube)   \n LCTES will be streamed to YouTube, and accessible to everyone (Tutorials are not streamed by our video team, but organizers may have made their own arrangements).  \n Each session will be streamed separately. The link to LCTES live stream will be visible at the top of the LCTES Discord channel and in the schedule.  \n We have paid for live subtitling of the main PLDI tracks.  \n Engaging in Q&A (Discord)   \n We encourage remote attendees to engage with talks via Discord (details below in the “Using Discord”  section).  \n Using Discord   \n As an affiliated conference, LCTES will use PLDI’s Discord server for virtual engagement. Discord is a social media platform that supports text, voice, and video chats. This section of the guide gives a brief overview of how we’ll use it and pointers to more general tips on how to use Discord.  \n Key information:  \n Our conference is completely | open and free for virtual attendees | , so our Discord server is open to everyone. \n  Please use this link  to join the PLDI’23 Discord server. \n  You can use Discord entirely | from the browser, or via an app | you install. \n  We have | one channel for each technical session | . Use that channel to engage virtually with the authors and other attendees. \n  We ask everyone to | edit their profile | to set their “server nickname” to their preferred name, and their pronouns (if they wish). Updating your avatar with a profile photo can also help improve the virtual experience. \n  Editing Your Profile   \n You first need to open user settings. At the lower left corner, you should see a small icon with your avatar and your Discord username, with a gear symbol to the right of it. If you click on the gear icon, it will open user settings.  \n On the left-hand side, you’ll see menu options. Select “Profiles”.  \n First, update your nickname. Under “Profiles”, select the “Server Profiles” tab, and ensure that the server is “PLDI 2023” under “Choose a server” like this  , and then edit your “Server Nickname” to be your preferred name, including your pronouns if you wish.  \n Next, update your avatar if you wish. Under “Profiles”, select “User Profile” and under “Avatar” select “Change Avatar”.  \n Click on the “X” at the top right to exit the user settings dialogue.  \n PLDI’s Discord Setup   \n The most important thing to know is that we’ll have a text channel for each session, and that’s the place to go to engage with the speakers at that session. You’ll find them listed under “PLDI MAIN TRACK”, “ISMM & LCTES”, and “WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS” respectively, as shown here  . You’ll see one channel per session for PLDI, ISMM, and LCTES and one per event for the workshops and tutorials.  \n You’ll also find links to these channels on the program, such as the link to #pldi-mon-0900-opening-royal in this example screenshot  .  \n We also have a number of other channels, including ones for general questions (#general) and for social events.  \n Discord Etiquette   \n To help make the platform friendly and engaging, we encourage you to clearly identify yourself (see notes above on editing your profile).  \n PLDI is committed to creating a safe and respectful environment for everyone. This includes conversations on Discord. Please be respectful and kind in your interactions on Discord.  \n Discord for talk Q&A   \n You can use Discord to ask questions of the authors, before the talk, during the talk, and after the talk, whether you are on-site or remote. When time permits, during each live post-talk Q&A, session chairs will be able to consult Discord and read questions on behalf of the person who posted it. Authors are encouraged to go to Discord after their talk and respond to follow-up questions.  \n How to Use Discord   \n The basic use of the text channels is quite straightforward.  \n Rather than attempting to provide a first-principles guide on how to use Discord in this document, we encourage you to check out the following references:  \n “How to Use Discord: A Beginner’s Guide” | by Boone Ashworth of Wired. \n  “Beginner’s Guide to Discord” | from Discord. \n  “How to Use Discord: A Beginner’s Guide” | by Marshall Gunnell of PCWorld. \n\n Questions?

This extended reach means that PLDI 2020 has great potential as a forum in which members of the Programming Languages community who have been moved by these events can come together to discuss problems related to lack of diversity and inclusion in our field, and to plan actions we might take to make our field more inviting, accepting, welcoming and inclusive to all minority groups, specifically including Black people.  Join the conversation about this journal    \n\n SJR   \n\n The SJR is a size-independent prestige indicator that ranks journals by their 'average prestige per article'. It is based on the idea that 'all citations are not created equal'. SJR is a measure of scientific influence of journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from It measures the scientific influence of the average article in a journal, it expresses how central to the global scientific discussion an average article of the journal is.  \n  \n Year | SJR \n 2004 | 0.474 \n 2005 | 0.631 \n 2006 | 0.353 \n 2007 | 0.432 \n 2008 | 0.391 \n 2009 | 0.262 \n 2010 | 0.286 \n 2011 | 0.254 \n 2012 | 0.296 \n 2013 | 0.497 \n 2014 | 0.228 \n 2015 | 0.321 \n 2016 | 0.176 \n 2017 | 0.156 \n 2018 | 0.151 \n 2019 | 0.154 \n\n Total Documents   \n\n Evolution of the number of published documents.

The chart shows the evolution of the average number of times documents published in a journal in the past two, three and four years have been cited in the current year.
